# some rules

Firstly, from raw syllables
-> create selected syllables, then
-> create top syllables, and also
-> create words list you created syllables, then
-> manually move JSON/syllables/top files and also JSON/words/final/words.json to the folder: JSON/all-syllables-&-words
-> create consolidatedJSON where you put all your syllables and words from JSON/all-syllables-&-words files, then
-> create consolidatedJSONArr from consolidatedJSON which array will contain all top patterns, syllables, and words to be practice.

# /nodejs/jsonCreator/ 3objNestedInJAONArr_no_top_cut.js

It was done, because in 3objNestedInJAONArr.js -> only top 80% was taken out of all the words. But in no top cut file, 100% was taken which is applicable for noSyllables.
