Jasnah Kholin pretended to enjoy the party, giving no indication that she intended to have one of the guests killed. She wandered through the crowded feast hall, listening as wine greased tongues and dimmed minds. Her uncle Dalinar was in the full swing of it, rising from the high table to shout for the Parshendi to bring out their drummers. Jasnah's brother, Elhokar, hurried to shush their unclethough the Alethi politely ignored Dalinar's outburst. All save Elhokar's wife, Aesudan, who snickered primly behind a handkerchief. Jasnah turned away from the high table and continued through the room. She had an appointment with an assassin, and she was all too glad to be leaving the stuffy room, which stank of too many perfumes mingling. A quartet of women played flutes on a raised platform across from the lively hearth, but the music had long since grown tedious. Unlike Dalinar, Jasnah drew stares. Like flies to rotten meat those eyes were, constantly following her. Whispers like buzzing wings. If there was one thing the Alethi court enjoyed more than wine, it was gossip. Everyone expected Dalinar to lose himself to wine during a feastbut the king's daughter, admitting to heresy? That was unprecedented. Jasnah had spoken of her feelings for precisely that reason. She passed the Parshendi delegation, which clustered near the high table, talking in their rhythmic language. Though this celebration honored them and the treaty they'd signed with Jasnah's father, they didn't look festive or even happy. They looked nervous. Of course, they weren't human, and the way they reacted was sometimes odd. Jasnah wanted to speak with them, but her appointment would not wait. She'd intentionally scheduled the meeting for the middle of the feast, as so many would be distracted and drunken. Jasnah headed toward the doors but then stopped in place. Her shadow was pointing in the wrong direction. The stuffy, shuffling, chattering room seemed to grow distant. Highprince Sadeas walked right through the shadow, which quite distinctly pointed toward the sphere lamp on the wall nearby. Engaged in conversation with his companion, Sadeas didn't notice. Jasnah stared at that shadowskin growing clammy, stomach clenched, the way she felt when she was about to vomit. Not again. She searched for another light source. A reason. Could she find a reason? No. The shadow languidly melted back toward her, oozing to her feet and then stretching out the other way. Her tension eased. But had anyone else seen? Blessedly, as she searched the room, she didn't find any aghast stares. People's attention had been drawn by the Parshendi drummers, who were clattering through the doorway to set up. Jasnah frowned as she noticed a nonParshendi servant in loose white clothing helping them. A Shin man? That was unusual. Jasnah composed herself. What did these episodes of hers mean? Superstitious folktales she'd read said that misbehaving shadows meant you were cursed. She usually dismissed such things as nonsense, but some superstitions were rooted in fact. Her other experiences proved that. She would need to investigate further. The calm, scholarly thoughts felt like a lie compared to the truth of her cold, clammy skin and the sweat trickling down the back of her neck. But it was important to be rational at all times, not just when calm. She forced herself out through the doors, leaving the muggy room for the quiet hallway. She'd chosen the back exit, commonly used by servants. It was the most direct route, after all. Here, masterservants dressed in black and white moved on errands from their brightlords or ladies. She had expected that, but had not anticipated the sight of her father standing just ahead, in quiet conference with Brightlord Meridas Amaram. What was the king doing out here? Gavilar Kholin was shorter than Amaram, yet the latter stooped shallowly in the king's company. That was common around Gavilar, who would speak with such quiet intensity that you wanted to lean in and listen, to catch every word and implication. He was a handsome man, unlike his brother, with a beard that outlined his strong jaw rather than covering it. He had a personal magnetism and intensity that Jasnah felt no biographer had yet managed to convey. Tearim, captain of the King's Guard, loomed behind them. He wore Gavilar's Shardplate; the king himself had stopped wearing it of late, preferring to entrust it to Tearim, who was known as one of the world's great duelists. Instead, Gavilar wore robes of a majestic, classical style. Jasnah glanced back at the feast hall. When had her father slipped out? Sloppy, she accused herself. You should have checked to see if he was still there before leaving. Ahead, he rested his hand on Amaram's shoulder and raised a finger, speaking harshly but quietly, the words indistinct to Jasnah. "Father?" she asked. He glanced at her. "Ah, Jasnah. Retiring so early?" "It's hardly early," Jasnah said, gliding forward. It seemed obvious to her that Gavilar and Amaram had ducked out to find privacy for their discussion. "This is the tiresome part of the feast, where the conversation grows louder but no smarter, and the company drunken." "Many people consider that sort of thing enjoyable." "Many people, unfortunately, are idiots." Her father smiled. "Is it terribly difficult for you?" he asked softly. "Living with the rest of us, suffering our average wits and simple thoughts? Is it lonely to be so singular in your brilliance, Jasnah?" She took it as the rebuke it was, and found herself blushing. Even her mother Navani could not do that to her. "Perhaps if you found pleasant associations," Gavilar said, "you would enjoy the feasts." His eyes swung toward Amaram, whom he'd long fancied as a potential match for her. It would never happen. Amaram met her eyes, then murmured words of parting to her father and hastened away down the corridor. "What errand did you give him?" Jasnah asked. "What are you about this night, Father?" "The treaty, of course." The treaty. Why did he care so much about it? Others had counseled that he either ignore the Parshendi or conquer them. Gavilar insisted upon an accommodation. "I should return to the celebration," Gavilar said, motioning to Tearim. The two moved along the hallway toward the doors Jasnah had left. "Father?" Jasnah said. "What is it you aren't telling me?" He glanced back at her, lingering. Pale green eyes, evidence of his good birth. When had he become so discerning? Storms . . . she felt as if she hardly knew this man any longer. Such a striking transformation in such a short time. From the way he inspected her, it almost seemed that he didn't trust her. Did he know about her meeting with Liss? He turned away without saying more and pushed back into the party, his guard following. What is going on in this palace? Jasnah thought. She took a deep breath. She would have to prod further. Hopefully he hadn't discovered her meetings with assassinsbut if he had, she would work with that knowledge. Surely he would see that someone needed to keep watch on the family as he grew increasingly consumed by his fascination with the Parshendi. Jasnah turned and continued on her way, passing a masterservant, who bowed. After walking a short time in the corridors, Jasnah noticed her shadow behaving oddly again. She sighed in annoyance as it pulled toward the three Stormlight lamps on the walls. Fortunately, she'd passed from the populated area, and no servants were here to see. "All right," she snapped. "That's enough." She hadn't meant to speak aloud. However, as the words slipped out, several distant shadowsoriginating in an intersection up aheadstirred to life. Her breath caught. Those shadows lengthened, deepened. Figures formed from them, growing, standing, rising. Stormfather. I'm going insane. One took the shape of a man of midnight blackness, though he had a certain reflective cast, as if he were made of oil. No . . . of some other liquid with a coating of oil floating on the outside, giving him a dark, prismatic quality. He strode toward her and unsheathed a sword. Logic, cold and resolute, guided Jasnah. Shouting would not bring help quickly enough, and the inky litheness of this creature bespoke a speed certain to exceed her own. She stood her ground and met the thing's glare, causing it to hesitate. Behind it, a small clutch of other creatures had materialized from the darkness. She had sensed those eyes upon her during the previous months. By now, the entire hallway had darkened, as if it had been submerged and was slowly sinking into lightless depths. Heart racing, breath quickening, Jasnah raised her hand to the granite wall beside her, seeking to touch something solid. Her fingers sank into the stone a fraction, as if the wall had become mud. Oh, storms. She had to do something. What? What could she possibly do? The figure before her glanced at the wall. The wall lamp nearest Jasnah went dark. And then . . . Then the palace disintegrated. The entire building shattered into thousands upon thousands of small glass spheres, like beads. Jasnah screamed as she fell backward through a dark sky. She was no longer in the palace; she was somewhere elseanother land, another time, another . . . something. She was left with the sight of the dark, lustrous figure hovering in the air above, seeming satisfied as he resheathed his sword. Jasnah crashed into somethingan ocean of the glass beads. Countless others rained around her, clicking like hailstones into the strange sea. She had never seen this place; she could not explain what had happened or what it meant. She thrashed as she sank into what seemed an impossibility. Beads of glass on all sides. She couldn't see anything beyond them, only felt herself descending through this churning, suffocating, clattering mass. She was going to die. Leaving work unfinished, leaving her family unprotected! She would never know the answers. No. Jasnah flailed in the darkness, beads rolling across her skin, getting into her clothing, working their way into her nose as she tried to swim. It was no use. She had no buoyancy in this mess. She raised a hand before her mouth and tried to make a pocket of air to use for breathing, and managed to gasp in a small breath. But the beads rolled around her hand, forcing between her fingers. She sank, more slowly now, as through a viscous liquid. Each bead that touched her gave a faint impression of something. A door. A table. A shoe. The beads found their way into her mouth. They seemed to move on their own. They would choke her, destroy her. No . . . no, it was just because they seemed attracted to her. An impression came to her, not as a distinct thought but a feeling. They wanted something from her. She snatched a bead in her hand; it gave her an impression of a cup. She gave . . . something . . . to it? The other beads near her pulled together, connecting, sticking like rocks sealed by mortar. In a moment she was falling not among individual beads, but through large masses of them stuck together into the shape of . . . A cup. Each bead was a pattern, a guide for the others. She released the one she held, and the beads around her broke apart. She floundered, searching desperately as her air ran out. She needed something she could use, something that would help, some way to survive! Desperate, she swept her arms wide to touch as many beads as she could. A silver platter. A coat. A statue. A lantern. And then, something ancient. Something ponderous and slow of thought, yet somehow strong. The palace itself. Frantic, Jasnah seized this sphere and forced her power into it. Her mind blurring, she gave this bead everything she had, and then commanded it to rise. Beads shifted. A great crashing sounded as beads met one another, clicking, cracking, rattling. It was almost like the sound of a wave breaking on rocks. Jasnah surged up from the depths, something solid moving beneath her, obeying her command. Beads battered her head, shoulders, arms, until finally she exploded from the surface of the sea of glass, hurling a spray of beads into a dark sky. She knelt on a platform of glass made up of small beads locked together. She held her hand to the side, uplifted, clutching the sphere that was the guide. Others rolled around her, forming into the shape of a hallway with lanterns on the walls, an intersection ahead. It didn't look right, of coursethe entire thing was made of beads. But it was a fair approximation. She wasn't strong enough to form the entire palace. She created only this hallway, without even a roofbut the floor supported her, kept her from sinking. She opened her mouth with a groan, beads falling out to clack against the floor. Then she coughed, drawing in sweet breaths, sweat trickling down the sides of her face and collecting on her chin. Ahead of her, the dark figure stepped up onto the platform. He again slid his sword from his sheath. Jasnah held up a second bead, the statue she'd sensed earlier. She gave it power, and other beads collected before her, taking the shape of one of the statues that lined the front of the feast hallthe statue of Talenelat'Elin, Herald of War. A tall, muscular man with a large Shardblade. It was not alive, but she made it move, lowering its sword of beads. She doubted it could fight. Round beads could not form a sharp sword. Yet the threat made the dark figure hesitate. Gritting her teeth, Jasnah heaved herself to her feet, beads streaming from her clothing. She would not kneel before this thing, whatever it was. She stepped up beside the bead statue, noting for the first time the strange clouds overhead. They seemed to form a narrow ribbon of highway, straight and long, pointing toward the horizon. She met the oil figure's gaze. It regarded her for a moment, then raised two fingers to its forehead and bowed, as if in respect, a cloak flourishing out behind. Others had gathered beyond it, and they turned to each other, exchanging hushed whispers. The place of beads faded, and Jasnah found herself back in the hallway of the palace. The real one, with real stone, though it had gone darkthe Stormlight dead in the lamps on the walls. The only illumination came from far down the corridor. She pressed back against the wall, breathing deeply. I, she thought, need to write this experience down. She would do so, then analyze and consider. Later. Now, she wanted to be away from this place. She hurried away, with no concern for her direction, trying to escape those eyes she still felt watching. It didn't work. Eventually, she composed herself and wiped the sweat from her face with a kerchief. Shadesmar, she thought. That is what it is called in the nursery tales. Shadesmar, the mythological kingdom of the spren. Mythology she'd never believed. Surely she could find something if she searched the histories well enough. Nearly everything that happened had happened before. The grand lesson of history, and . . . Storms! Her appointment. Cursing to herself, she hurried on her way. That experience continued to distract her, but she needed to make her meeting. So she continued down two floors, getting farther from the sounds of the thrumming Parshendi drums until she could hear only the sharpest cracks of their beats. That music's complexity had always surprised her, suggesting that the Parshendi were not the uncultured savages many took them for. This far away, the music sounded disturbingly like the beads from the dark place, rattling against one another. She'd intentionally chosen this outoftheway section of the palace for her meeting with Liss. Nobody ever visited this set of guest rooms. A man that Jasnah didn't know lounged here, outside the proper door. That relieved her. The man would be Liss's new servant, and his presence meant Liss hadn't left, despite Jasnah's tardiness. Composing herself, she nodded to the guarda Veden brute with red speckling his beardand pushed into the room. Liss stood from the table inside the small chamber. She wore a maid's dress low cut, of courseand could have been Alethi. Or Veden. Or Bav. Depending on which part of her accent she chose to emphasize. Long dark hair, worn loose, and a plump, attractive figure made her distinctive in all the right ways. "You're late, Brightness," Liss said. Jasnah gave no reply. She was the employer here, and was not required to give excuses. Instead, she laid something on the table beside Liss. A small envelope, sealed with weevilwax. Jasnah set two fingers on it, considering. No. This was too brash. She didn't know if her father realized what she was doing, but even if he hadn't, too much was happening in this palace. She did not want to commit to an assassination until she was more certain. Fortunately, she had prepared a backup plan. She slid a second envelope from the safepouch inside her sleeve and set it on the table in place of the first. She removed her fingers from it, rounding the table and sitting down. Liss sat back down and made the letter vanish into the bust of her dress. "An odd night, Brightness," the woman said, "to be engaging in treason." "I am hiring you to watch only." "Pardon, Brightness. But one does not commonly hire an assassin to watch. Only." "You have instructions in the envelope," Jasnah said. "Along with initial payment. I chose you because you are expert at extended observations. It is what I want. For now." Liss smiled, but nodded. "Spying on the wife of the heir to the throne? It will be more expensive this way. You sure you don't simply want her dead?" Jasnah drummed her fingers on the table, then realized she was doing it to the beat of the drums above. The music was so unexpectedly complexprecisely like the Parshendi themselves. Too much is happening, she thought. I need to be very careful. Very subtle. "I accept the cost," Jasnah replied. "In one week's time, I will arrange for one of my sisterinlaw's maids to be released. You will apply for the position, using faked credentials I assume you are capable of producing. You will be hired. "From there, you watch and report. I will tell you if your other services are needed. You move only if I say. Understood?" "You're the one payin'," Liss said, a faint Bav dialect showing through. If it showed, it was only because she wished it. Liss was the most skilled assassin Jasnah knew. People called her the Weeper, as she gouged out the eyes of the targets she killed. Although she hadn't coined the cognomen, it served her purpose well, since she had secrets to hide. For one thing, nobody knew that the Weeper was a woman. It was said the Weeper gouged the eyes out to proclaim indifference to whether her victims were lighteyed or dark. The truth was that the action hid a second secretLiss didn't want anyone to know that the way she killed left corpses with burnedout sockets. "Our meeting is done, then," Liss said, standing. Jasnah nodded absently, mind again on her bizarre interaction with the spren earlier. That glistening skin, colors dancing across a surface the color of tar . . . She forced her mind away from that moment. She needed to devote her attention to the task at hand. For now, that was Liss. Liss hesitated at the door before leaving. "Do you know why I like you, Brightness?" "I suspect that it has something to do with my pockets and their proverbial depth." Liss smiled. "There's that, ain't going to deny it, but you're also different from other lighteyes. When others hire me, they turn up their noses at the entire process. They're all too eager to use my services, but sneer and wring their hands, as if they hate being forced to do something utterly distasteful." "Assassination is distasteful, Liss. So is cleaning out chamber pots. I can respect the one employed for such jobs without admiring the job itself." Liss grinned, then cracked the door. "That new servant of yours outside," Jasnah said. "Didn't you say you wanted to show him off for me?" "Talak?" Liss said, glancing at the Veden man. "Oh, you mean that other one. No, Brightness, I sold that one to a slaver a few weeks ago." Liss grimaced. "Really? I thought you said he was the best servant you'd ever had." "Too good a servant," Liss said. "Let's leave it at that. Storming creepy, that Shin fellow was." Liss shivered visibly, then slipped out the door. "Remember our first agreement," Jasnah said after her. "Always there in the back o' my mind, Brightness." Liss closed the door. Jasnah settled in her seat, lacing her fingers in front of her. Their "first agreement" was that if anyone should come to Liss and offer a contract on a member of Jasnah's family, Liss would let Jasnah match the offer in exchange for the name of the one who made it. Liss would do it. Probably. So would the dozen other assassins Jasnah dealt with. A repeat customer was always more valuable than a oneoff contract, and it was in the best interests of a woman like Liss to have a friend in the government. Jasnah's family was safe from the likes of these. Unless she herself employed the assassins, of course. Jasnah let out a deep sigh, then rose, trying to shrug off the weight she felt bearing her down. Wait. Did Liss say her old servant was Shin? It was probably a coincidence. Shin people weren't plentiful in the East, but you did see them on occasion. Still, Liss mentioning a Shin man and Jasnah seeing one among the Parshendi . . . well, there was no harm in checking, even if it meant returning to the feast. Something was off about this night, and not just because of her shadow and the spren. Jasnah left the small chamber in the bowels of the palace and strode out into the hallway. She turned her steps upward. Above, the drums cut off abruptly, like an instrument's strings suddenly cut. Was the party ending so early? Dalinar hadn't done something to offend the celebrants, had he? That man and his wine . . . Well, the Parshendi had ignored his offenses in the past, so they probably would again. In truth, Jasnah was happy for her father's sudden focus on a treaty. It meant she would have a chance to study Parshendi traditions and histories at her leisure. Could it be, she wondered, that scholars have been searching in the wrong ruins all these years? Words echoed in the hallway, coming from up ahead. "I'm worried about Ash." "You're worried about everything." Jasnah hesitated in the hallway. "She's getting worse," the voice continued. "We weren't supposed to get worse. Am I getting worse? I think I feel worse." "Shut up." "I don't like this. What we've done was wrong. That creature carries my lord's own Blade. We shouldn't have let him keep it. He" The two passed through the intersection ahead of Jasnah. They were ambassadors from the West, including the Azish man with the white birthmark on his cheek. Or was it a scar? The shorter of the two menhe could have been Alethicut off when he noticed Jasnah. He let out a squeak, then hurried on his way. The Azish man, the one dressed in black and silver, stopped and looked her up and down. He frowned. "Is the feast over already?" Jasnah asked down the hallway. Her brother had invited these two to the celebration along with every other ranking foreign dignitary in Kholinar. "Yes," the man said. His stare made her uncomfortable. She walked forward anyway. I should check further into these two, she thought. She'd investigated their backgrounds, of course, and found nothing of note. Had they been talking about a Shardblade? "Come on!" the shorter man said, returning and taking the taller man by the arm. He allowed himself to be pulled away. Jasnah walked to where the corridors crossed, then watched them go. Where once drums had sounded, screams suddenly rose. Oh no . . . Jasnah turned with alarm, then grabbed her skirt and ran as hard as she could. A dozen different potential disasters raced through her mind. What else could happen on this broken night, when shadows stood up and her father looked upon her with suspicion? Nerves stretched thin, she reached the steps and started climbing. It took her far too long. She could hear the screams as she climbed and finally emerged into chaos. Dead bodies in one direction, a demolished wall in the other. How . . . The destruction led toward her father's rooms. The entire palace shook, and a crunch echoed from that direction. No, no, no! She passed Shardblade cuts on the stone walls as she ran. Please. Corpses with burned eyes. Bodies littered the floor like discarded bones at the dinner table. Not this. A broken doorway. Her father's quarters. Jasnah stopped in the hallway, gasping. Control yourself, control . . . She couldn't. Not now. Frantic, she ran into the quarters, though a Shardbearer would kill her with ease. She wasn't thinking straight. She should get someone who could help. Dalinar? He'd be drunk. Sadeas, then. The room looked like it had been hit by a highstorm. Furniture in a shambles, splinters everywhere. The balcony doors were broken outward. Someone lurched toward them, a man in her father's Shardplate. Tearim, the bodyguard? No. The helm was broken. It was not Tearim, but Gavilar. Someone on the balcony screamed. "Father!" Jasnah shouted. Gavilar hesitated as he stepped out onto the balcony, looking back at her. The balcony broke beneath him. Jasnah screamed, dashing through the room to the broken balcony, falling to her knees at the edge. Wind tugged locks of hair loose from her bun as she watched two men fall. Her father, and the Shin man in white from the feast. The Shin man glowed with a white light. He fell onto the wall. He hit it, rolling, then came to a stop. He stood up, somehow remaining on the outer palace wall and not falling. It defied reason. He turned, then stalked toward her father. Jasnah watched, growing cold, helpless as the assassin stepped down to her father and knelt over him. Tears fell from her chin, and the wind caught them. What was he doing down there? She couldn't make it out. When the assassin walked away, he left behind her father's corpse. Impaled on a length of wood. He was deadindeed, his Shardblade had appeared beside him, as they all did when their Bearers died. "I worked so hard . . ." Jasnah whispered, numb. "Everything I did to protect this family . . ." How? Liss. Liss had done this! No. Jasnah wasn't thinking straight. That Shin man . . . she wouldn't have admitted to owning him in such a case. She'd sold him. "We are sorry for your loss." Jasnah spun, blinking bleary eyes. Three Parshendi, including Klade, stood in the doorway in their distinctive clothing. Neatly stitched cloth wraps for both men and women, sashes at the waist, loose shirts with no sleeves. Hanging vests, open at the sides, woven in bright colors. They didn't segregate clothing by gender. She thought they did by caste, however, and Stop it, she thought at herself. Stop thinking like a scholar for one storming day! "We take responsibility for his death," said the foremost Parshendi. Gangnah was female, though with the Parshendi, the gender differences seemed minimal. The clothing hid breasts and hips, neither of which were ever very pronounced. Fortunately, the lack of a beard was a clear indication. All the Parshendi men she'd ever seen had beards, which they wore tied with bits of gemstone, and STOP IT. "What did you say?" Jasnah demanded, forcing herself to her feet. "Why would it be your fault, Gangnah?" "Because we hired the assassin," the Parshendi woman said in her heavily accented singsong voice. "We killed your father, Jasnah Kholin." "You . . ." Emotion suddenly ran cold, like a river freezing in the heights. Jasnah looked from Gangnah to Klade, to Varnali. Elders, all three of them. Members of the Parshendi ruling council. "Why?" Jasnah whispered. "Because it had to be done," Gangnah said. "Why?" Jasnah demanded, stalking forward. "He fought for you! He kept the predators at bay! My father wanted peace, you monsters! Why would you betray us now, of all times?" Gangnah drew her lips to a line. The song of her voice changed. She seemed almost like a mother, explaining something very difficult to a small child. "Because your father was about to do something very dangerous." "Send for Brightlord Dalinar!" a voice outside in the hall shouted. "Storms! Did my orders get to Elhokar? The crown prince must be taken to safety!" Highprince Sadeas stumbled into the room along with a team of soldiers. His bulbous, ruddy face was wet with sweat, and he wore Gavilar's clothing, the regal robes of office. "What are the savages doing here? Storms! Protect Princess Jasnah. The one who did thishe was in their retinue!" The soldiers moved to surround the Parshendi. Jasnah ignored them, turning and stepping back to the broken doorway, hand on the wall, looking down at her father splayed on the rocks below, Blade beside him. "There will be war," she whispered. "And I will not stand in its way." "This is understood," Gangnah said from behind. "The assassin," Jasnah said. "He walked on the wall." Gangnah said nothing. In the shattering of her world, Jasnah caught hold of this fragment. She had seen something tonight. Something that should not have been possible. Did it relate to the strange spren? Her experience in that place of glass beads and a dark sky? These questions became her lifeline for stability. Sadeas demanded answers from the Parshendi leaders. He received none. When he stepped up beside her and saw the wreckage below, he went barreling off, shouting for his guards and running down below to reach the fallen king. Hours later, it was discovered that the assassinationand the surrender of three of the Parshendi leadershad covered the flight of the larger portion of their number. They escaped the city quickly, and the cavalry Dalinar sent after them were destroyed. A hundred horses, each nearly priceless, lost along with their riders. The Parshendi leaders said nothing more and gave no clues, even when they were strung up, hanged for their crimes. Jasnah ignored all that. Instead, she interrogated the surviving guards on what they had seen. She followed leads about the nowfamous assassin's nature, prying information from Liss. She got almost nothing. Liss had owned him only a short time, and claimed she hadn't known about his strange powers. Jasnah couldn't find the previous owner. Next came the books. A dedicated, frenzied effort to distract her from what she had lost. That night, Jasnah had seen the impossible. She would learn what it meant. To be perfectly frank, what has happened these last two months is upon my head. The death, destruction, loss, and pain are my burden. I should have seen it coming. And I should have stopped it. From the personal journal of Navani Kholin, Jeseses 1174 Shallan pinched the thin charcoal pencil and drew a series of straight lines radiating from a sphere on the horizon. That sphere wasn't quite the sun, nor was it one of the moons. Clouds outlined in charcoal seemed to stream toward it. And the sea beneath them . . . A drawing could not convey the bizarre nature of that ocean, made not of water but of small beads of translucent glass. Shallan shivered, remembering that place. Jasnah knew much more of it than she would speak of to her ward, and Shallan wasn't certain how to ask. How did one demand answers after a betrayal such as Shallan's? Only a few days had passed since that event, and Shallan still didn't know exactly how her relationship with Jasnah would proceed. The deck rocked as the ship tacked, enormous sails fluttering overhead. Shallan was forced to grab the railing with her clothed safehand to steady herself. Captain Tozbek said that so far, the seas hadn't been bad for this part of Longbrow's Straits. However, she might have to go below if the waves and motion got much worse. Shallan exhaled and tried to relax as the ship settled. A chill wind blew, and windspren zipped past on invisible air currents. Every time the sea grew rough, Shallan remembered that day, that alien ocean of glass beads . . . She looked down again at what she'd drawn. She had only glimpsed that place, and her sketch was not perfect. It She frowned. On her paper, a pattern had risen, like an embossing. What had she done? That pattern was almost as wide as the page, a sequence of complex lines with sharp angles and repeated arrowhead shapes. Was it an effect of drawing that weird place, the place Jasnah said was named Shadesmar? Shallan hesitantly moved her freehand to feel the unnatural ridges on the page. The pattern moved, sliding across the page like an axehound pup under a bedsheet. Shallan yelped and leapt from her seat, dropping her sketchpad to the deck. The loose pages slumped to the planks, fluttering and then scattering in the wind. Nearby sailorsThaylen men with long white eyebrows they combed back over their earsscrambled to help, snatching sheets from the air before they could blow overboard. "You all right, young miss?" Tozbek asked, looking over from a conversation with one of his mates. The short, portly Tozbek wore a wide sash and a coat of gold and red matched by the cap on his head. He wore his eyebrows up and stiffened into a fanned shape above his eyes. "I'm well, Captain," Shallan said. "I was merely spooked." Yalb stepped up to her, proffering the pages. "Your accouterments, my lady." Shallan raised an eyebrow. "Accouterments?" "Sure," the young sailor said with a grin. "I'm practicing my fancy words. They help a fellow obtain reasonable feminine companionship. You knowthe kind of young lady who doesn't smell too bad an' has at least a few teeth left." "Lovely," Shallan said, taking the sheets back. "Well, depending on your definition of lovely, at least." She suppressed further quips, suspiciously regarding the stack of pages in her hand. The picture she'd drawn of Shadesmar was on top, no longer bearing the strange embossed ridges. "What happened?" Yalb said. "Did a cremling crawl out from under you or something?" As usual, he wore an openfronted vest and a pair of loose trousers. "It was nothing," Shallan said softly, tucking the pages away into her satchel. Yalb gave her a little saluteshe had no idea why he had taken to doing that and went back to tying rigging with the other sailors. She soon caught bursts of laughter from the men near him, and when she glanced at him, gloryspren danced around his headthey took the shape of little spheres of light. He was apparently very proud of the jape he'd just made. She smiled. It was indeed fortunate that Tozbek had been delayed in Kharbranth. She liked this crew, and was happy that Jasnah had selected them for their voyage. Shallan sat back down on the box that Captain Tozbek had ordered lashed beside the railing so she could enjoy the sea as they sailed. She had to be wary of the spray, which wasn't terribly good for her sketches, but so long as the seas weren't rough, the opportunity to watch the waters was worth the trouble. The scout atop the rigging let out a shout. Shallan squinted in the direction he pointed. They were within sight of the distant mainland, sailing parallel to it. In fact, they'd docked at port last night to shelter from the highstorm that had blown past. When sailing, you always wanted to be near to portventuring into open seas when a highstorm could surprise you was suicidal. The smear of darkness to the north was the Frostlands, a largely uninhabited area along the bottom edge of Roshar. Occasionally, she caught a glimpse of higher cliffs to the south. Thaylenah, the great island kingdom, made another barrier there. The straits passed between the two. The lookout had spotted something in the waves just north of the ship, a bobbing shape that at first appeared to be a large log. No, it was much larger than that, and wider. Shallan stood, squinting, as it drew closer. It turned out to be a domed browngreen shell, about the size of three rowboats lashed together. As they passed by, the shell came up alongside the ship and somehow managed to keep pace, sticking up out of the water perhaps six or eight feet. A santhid! Shallan leaned out over the rail, looking down as the sailors jabbered excitedly, several joining her in craning out to see the creature. Santhidyn were so reclusive that some of her books claimed they were extinct and all modern reports of them untrustworthy. "You are good luck, young miss!" Yalb said to her with a laugh as he passed by with rope. "We ain't seen a santhid in years." "You still aren't seeing one," Shallan said. "Only the top of its shell." To her disappointment, waters hid anything elsesave shadows of something in the depths that might have been long arms extending downward. Stories claimed the beasts would sometimes follow ships for days, waiting out in the sea as the vessel went into port, then following them again once the ship left. "The shell is all you ever see of one," Yalb said. "Passions, this is a good sign!" Shallan clutched her satchel. She took a Memory of the creature down there beside the ship by closing her eyes, fixing the image of it in her head so she could draw it with precision. Draw what, though? she thought. A lump in the water? An idea started to form in her head. She spoke it aloud before she could think better. "Bring me that rope," she said, turning to Yalb. "Brightness?" he asked, stopping in place. "Tie a loop in one end," she said, hurriedly setting her satchel on her seat. "I need to get a look at the santhid. I've never actually put my head underwater in the ocean. Will the salt make it difficult to see?" "Underwater?" Yalb said, voice squeaking. "You're not tying the rope." "Because I'm not a storming fool! Captain will have my head if . . ." "Get a friend," Shallan said, ignoring him and taking the rope to tie one end into a small loop. "You're going to lower me down over the side, and I'm going to get a glimpse of what's under the shell. Do you realize that nobody has ever produced a drawing of a live santhid? All the ones that have washed up on beaches were badly decomposed. And since sailors consider hunting the things to be bad luck" "It is!" Yalb said, voice growing more high pitched. "Ain't nobody going to kill one." Shallan finished the loop and hurried to the side of the ship, her red hair whipping around her face as she leaned out over the rail. The santhid was still there. How did it keep up? She could see no fins. She looked back at Yalb, who held the rope, grinning. "Ah, Brightness. Is this payback for what I said about your backside to Beznk? That was just in jest, but you got me good! I . . ." He trailed off as she met his eyes. "Storms. You're serious." "I'll not have another opportunity like this. Naladan chased these things for most of her life and never got a good look at one." "This is insanity!" "No, this is scholarship! I don't know what kind of view I can get through the water, but I have to try." Yalb sighed. "We have masks. Made from a tortoise shell with glass in hollowedout holes on the front and bladders along the edges to keep the water out. You can duck your head underwater with one on and see. We use them to check over the hull at dock." "Wonderful!" "Of course, I'd have to go to the captain to get permission to take one. . . ." She folded her arms. "Devious of you. Well, get to it." It was unlikely she'd be able to go through with this without the captain finding out anyway. Yalb grinned. "What happened to you in Kharbranth? Your first trip with us, you were so timid, you looked like you'd faint at the mere thought of sailing away from your homeland!" Shallan hesitated, then found herself blushing. "This is somewhat foolhardy, isn't it?" "Hanging from a moving ship and sticking your head in the water?" Yalb said. "Yeah. Kind of a little." "Do you think . . . we could stop the ship?" Yalb laughed, but went jogging off to speak with the captain, taking her query as an indication she was still determined to go through with her plan. And she was. What did happen to me? she wondered. The answer was simple. She'd lost everything. She'd stolen from Jasnah Kholin, one of the most powerful women in the worldand in so doing had not only lost her chance to study as she'd always dreamed, but had also doomed her brothers and her house. She had failed utterly and miserably. And she'd pulled through it. She wasn't unscathed. Her credibility with Jasnah had been severely wounded, and she felt that she had all but abandoned her family. But something about the experience of stealing Jasnah's Soulcasterwhich had turned out to be a fake anywaythen nearly being killed by a man she'd thought was in love with her . . . Well, she now had a better idea of how bad things could get. It was as if . . . once she had feared the darkness, but now she had stepped into it. She had experienced some of the horrors that awaited her there. Terrible as they were, at least she knew. You always knew, a voice whispered deep inside of her. You grew up with horrors, Shallan. You just won't let yourself remember them. "What is this?" Tozbek asked as he came up, his wife, Ashlv, at his side. The diminutive woman did not speak much; she dressed in a skirt and blouse of bright yellow, a headscarf covering all of her hair except the two white eyebrows, which she had curled down beside her cheeks. "Young miss," Tozbek said, "you want to go swimming? Can't you wait until we get into port? I know of some nice areas where the water is not nearly so cold." "I won't be swimming," Shallan said, blushing further. What would she wear to go swimming with men about? Did people really do that? "I need to get a closer look at our companion." She gestured toward the sea creature. "Young miss, you know I can't allow something so dangerous. Even if we stopped the ship, what if the beast harmed you?" "They're said to be harmless." "They are so rare, can we really know for certain? Besides, there are other animals in these seas that could harm you. Redwaters hunt this area for certain, and we might be in shallow enough water for khornaks to be a worry." Tozbek shook his head. "I'm sorry, I just cannot allow it." Shallan bit her lip, and found her heart beating traitorously. She wanted to push harder, but that decisive look in his eyes made her wilt. "Very well." Tozbek smiled broadly. "I'll take you to see some shells in the port at Amydlatn when we stop there, young miss. They have quite a collection!" She didn't know where that was, but from the jumble of consonants squished together, she assumed it would be on the Thaylen side. Most cities were, this far south. Though Thaylenah was nearly as frigid as the Frostlands, people seemed to enjoy living there. Of course, Thaylens were all a little off. How else to describe Yalb and the others wearing no shirts despite the chill in the air? They weren't the ones contemplating a dip in the ocean, Shallan reminded herself. She looked over the side of the ship again, watching waves break against the shell of the gentle santhid. What was it? A greatshelled beast, like the fearsome chasmfiends of the Shattered Plains? Was it more like a fish under there, or more like a tortoise? The santhidyn were so rareand the occasions when scholars had seen them in person so infrequentthat the theories all contradicted one another. She sighed and opened her satchel, then set to organizing her papers, most of which were practice sketches of the sailors in various poses as they worked to maneuver the massive sails overhead, tacking against the wind. Her father would never have allowed her to spend a day sitting and watching a bunch of shirtless darkeyes. How much her life had changed in such a short time. She was working on a sketch of the santhid's shell when Jasnah stepped up onto the deck. Like Shallan, Jasnah wore the havah, a Vorin dress of distinctive design. The hemline was down at her feet and the neckline almost at her chin. Some of the Thaylenswhen they thought she wasn't listeningreferred to the clothing as prudish. Shallan disagreed; the havah wasn't prudish, but elegant. Indeed, the silk hugged the body, particularly through the bustand the way the sailors gawked at Jasnah indicated they didn't find the garment unflattering. Jasnah was pretty. Lush of figure, tan of skin. Immaculate eyebrows, lips painted a deep red, hair up in a fine braid. Though Jasnah was twice Shallan's age, her mature beauty was something to be admired, even envied. Why did the woman have to be so perfect? Jasnah ignored the eyes of the sailors. It wasn't that she didn't notice men. Jasnah noticed everything and everyone. She simply didn't seem to care, one way or another, how men perceived her. No, that's not true, Shallan thought as Jasnah walked over. She wouldn't take the time to do her hair, or put on makeup, if she didn't care how she was perceived. In that, Jasnah was an enigma. On one hand, she seemed to be a scholar concerned only with her research. On the other hand, she cultivated the poise and dignity of a king's daughterand, at times, used it like a bludgeon. "And here you are," Jasnah said, walking to Shallan. A spray of water from the side of the ship chose that moment to fly up and sprinkle her. She frowned at the drops of water beading on her silk clothing, then looked back to Shallan and raised her eyebrow. "The ship, you may have noticed, has two very fine cabins that I hired out for us at no small expense." "Yes, but they're inside." "As rooms usually are." "I've spent most of my life inside." "So you will spend much more of it, if you wish to be a scholar." Shallan bit her lip, waiting for the order to go below. Curiously, it did not come. Jasnah gestured for Captain Tozbek to approach, and he did so, groveling his way over with cap in hand. "Yes, Brightness?" he asked. "I should like another of these . . . seats," Jasnah said, regarding Shallan's box. Tozbek quickly had one of his men lash a second box in place. As she waited for the seat to be ready, Jasnah waved for Shallan to hand over her sketches. Jasnah inspected the drawing of the santhid, then looked over the side of the ship. "No wonder the sailors were making such a fuss." "Luck, Brightness!" one of the sailors said. "It is a good omen for your trip, don't you think?" "I shall take any fortune provided me, Nanhel Eltorv," she said. "Thank you for the seat." The sailor bowed awkwardly before retreating. "You think they're superstitious fools," Shallan said softly, watching the sailor leave. "From what I have observed," Jasnah said, "these sailors are men who have found a purpose in life and now take simple pleasure in it." Jasnah looked at the next drawing. "Many people make far less out of life. Captain Tozbek runs a good crew. You were wise in bringing him to my attention." Shallan smiled. "You didn't answer my question." "You didn't ask a question," Jasnah said. "These sketches are characteristically skillful, Shallan, but weren't you supposed to be reading?" "I . . . had trouble concentrating." "So you came up on deck," Jasnah said, "to sketch pictures of young men working without their shirts on. You expected this to help your concentration?" Shallan blushed, as Jasnah stopped at one sheet of paper in the stack. Shallan sat patientlyshe'd been well trained in that by her fatheruntil Jasnah turned it toward her. The picture of Shadesmar, of course. "You have respected my command not to peer into this realm again?" Jasnah asked. "Yes, Brightness. That picture was drawn from a memory of my first . . . lapse." Jasnah lowered the page. Shallan thought she saw a hint of something in the woman's expression. Was Jasnah wondering if she could trust Shallan's word? "I assume this is what is bothering you?" Jasnah asked. "Yes, Brightness." "I suppose I should explain it to you, then." "Really? You would do this?" "You needn't sound so surprised." "It seems like powerful information," Shallan said. "The way you forbade me . . . I assumed that knowledge of this place was secret, or at least not to be trusted to one of my age." Jasnah sniffed. "I've found that refusing to explain secrets to young people makes them more prone to get themselves into trouble, not less. Your experimentation proves that you've already stumbled facefirst into all of this as I once did myself, I'll have you know. I know through painful experience how dangerous Shadesmar can be. If I leave you in ignorance, I'll be to blame if you get yourself killed there." "So you'd have explained about it if I'd asked earlier in our trip?" "Probably not," Jasnah admitted. "I had to see how willing you were to obey me. This time." Shallan wilted, and suppressed the urge to point out that back when she'd been a studious and obedient ward, Jasnah hadn't divulged nearly as many secrets as she did now. "So what is it? That . . . place." "It's not truly a location," Jasnah said. "Not as we usually think of them. Shadesmar is here, all around us, right now. All things exist there in some form, as all things exist here." Shallan frowned. "I don't" Jasnah held up a finger to quiet her. "All things have three components: the soul, the body, and the mind. That place you saw, Shadesmar, is what we call the Cognitive Realmthe place of the mind. "All around us you see the physical world. You can touch it, see it, hear it. This is how your physical body experiences the world. Well, Shadesmar is the way that your cognitive selfyour unconscious selfexperiences the world. Through your hidden senses touching that realm, you make intuitive leaps in logic and you form hopes. It is likely through those extra senses that you, Shallan, create art." Water splashed on the bow of the ship as it crossed a swell. Shallan wiped a drop of salty water from her cheek, trying to think through what Jasnah had just said. "That made almost no sense whatsoever to me, Brightness." "I should hope that it didn't," Jasnah said. "I've spent six years researching Shadesmar, and I still barely know what to make of it. I shall have to accompany you there several times before you can understand, even a little, the true significance of the place." Jasnah grimaced at the thought. Shallan was always surprised to see visible emotion from her. Emotion was something relatable, something humanand Shallan's mental image of Jasnah Kholin was of someone almost divine. It was, upon reflection, an odd way to regard a determined atheist. "Listen to me," Jasnah said. "My own words betray my ignorance. I told you that Shadesmar wasn't a place, and yet I call it one in my next breath. I speak of visiting it, though it is all around us. We simply don't have the proper terminology to discuss it. Let me try another tactic." Jasnah stood up, and Shallan hastened to follow. They walked along the ship's rail, feeling the deck sway beneath their feet. Sailors made way for Jasnah with quick bows. They regarded her with as much reverence as they would a king. How did she do it? How could she control her surroundings without seeming to do anything at all? "Look down into the waters," Jasnah said as they reached the bow. "What do you see?" Shallan stopped beside the rail and stared down at the blue waters, foaming as they were broken by the ship's prow. Here at the bow, she could see a deepness to the swells. An unfathomable expanse that extended not just outward, but downward. "I see eternity," Shallan said. "Spoken like an artist," Jasnah said. "This ship sails across depths we cannot know. Beneath these waves is a bustling, frantic, unseen world." Jasnah leaned forward, gripping the rail with one hand unclothed and the other veiled within the safehand sleeve. She looked outward. Not at the depths, and not at the land distantly peeking over both the northern and southern horizons. She looked toward the east. Toward the storms. "There is an entire world, Shallan," Jasnah said, "of which our minds skim but the surface. A world of deep, profound thought. A world created by deep, profound thoughts. When you see Shadesmar, you enter those depths. It is an alien place to us in some ways, but at the same time we formed it. With some help." "We did what?" "What are spren?" Jasnah asked. The question caught Shallan off guard, but by now she was accustomed to challenging questions from Jasnah. She took time to think and consider her answer. "Nobody knows what spren are," Shallan said, "though many philosophers have different opinions on" "No," Jasnah said. "What are they?" "I . . ." Shallan looked up at a pair of windspren spinning through the air above. They looked like tiny ribbons of light, glowing softly, dancing around one another. "They're living ideas." Jasnah spun on her. "What?" Shallan said, jumping. "Am I wrong?" "No," Jasnah said. "You're right." The woman narrowed her eyes. "By my best guess, spren are elements of the Cognitive Realm that have leaked into the physical world. They're concepts that have gained a fragment of sentience, perhaps because of human intervention. "Think of a man who gets angry often. Think of how his friends and family might start referring to that anger as a beast, as a thing that possesses him, as something external to him. Humans personify. We speak of the wind as if it has a will of its own. "Spren are those ideasthe ideas of collective human experiencesomehow come alive. Shadesmar is where that first happens, and it is their place. Though we created it, they shaped it. They live there; they rule there, within their own cities." "Cities?" "Yes," Jasnah said, looking back out over the ocean. She seemed troubled. "Spren are wild in their variety. Some are as clever as humans and create cities. Others are like fish and simply swim in the currents." Shallan nodded. Though in truth she was having trouble grasping any of this, she didn't want Jasnah to stop talking. This was the sort of knowledge that Shallan needed, the kind of thing she craved. "Does this have to do with what you discovered? About the parshmen, the Voidbringers?" "I haven't been able to determine that yet. The spren are not always forthcoming. In some cases, they do not know. In others, they do not trust me because of our ancient betrayal." Shallan frowned, looking to her teacher. "Betrayal?" "They tell me of it," Jasnah said, "but they won't say what it was. We broke an oath, and in so doing offended them greatly. I think some of them may have died, though how a concept can die, I do not know." Jasnah turned to Shallan with a solemn expression. "I realize this is overwhelming. You will have to learn this, all of it, if you are to help me. Are you still willing?" "Do I have a choice?" A smile tugged at the edges of Jasnah's lips. "I doubt it. You Soulcast on your own, without the aid of a fabrial. You are like me." Shallan stared out over the waters. Like Jasnah. What did it mean? Why She froze, blinking. For a moment, she thought she'd seen the same pattern as before, the one that had made ridges on her sheet of paper. This time it had been in the water, impossibly formed on the surface of a wave. "Brightness . . ." she said, resting her fingers on Jasnah's arm. "I thought I saw something in the water, just now. A pattern of sharp lines, like a maze." "Show me where." "It was on one of the waves, and we've passed it now. But I think I saw it earlier, on one of my pages. Does it mean something?" "Most certainly. I must admit, Shallan, I find the coincidence of our meeting to be startling. Suspiciously so." "Brightness?" "They were involved," Jasnah said. "They brought you to me. And they are still watching you, it appears. So no, Shallan, you no longer have a choice. The old ways are returning, and I don't see it as a hopeful sign. It's an act of selfpreservation. The spren sense impending danger, and so they return to us. Our attention now must turn to the Shattered Plains and the relics of Urithiru. It will be a long, long time before you return to your homeland." Shallan nodded mutely. "This worries you," Jasnah said. "Yes, Brightness. My family . . ." Shallan felt like a traitor in abandoning her brothers, who had been depending on her for wealth. She'd written to them and explained, without many specifics, that she'd had to return the stolen Soulcasterand was now required to help Jasnah with her work. Balat's reply had been positive, after a fashion. He said he was glad at least one of them had escaped the fate that was coming to the house. He thought that the rest of themher three brothers and Balat's betrothedwere doomed. They might be right. Not only would Father's debts crush them, but there was the matter of her father's broken Soulcaster. The group that had given it to him wanted it back. Unfortunately, Shallan was convinced that Jasnah's quest was of the utmost importance. The Voidbringers would soon returnindeed, they were not some distant threat from stories. They lived among men, and had for centuries. The gentle, quiet parshmen who worked as perfect servants and slaves were really destroyers. Stopping the catastrophe of the return of the Voidbringers was a greater duty than even protecting her brothers. It was still painful to admit that. Jasnah studied her. "With regard to your family, Shallan. I have taken some action." "Action?" Shallan said, taking the taller woman's arm. "You've helped my brothers?" "After a fashion," Jasnah said. "Wealth would not truly solve this problem, I suspect, though I have arranged for a small gift to be sent. From what you've said, your family's problems really stem from two issues. First, the Ghostbloods desire their Soulcasterwhich you have brokento be returned. Second, your house is without allies and deeply in debt." Jasnah proffered a sheet of paper. "This," she continued, "is from a conversation I had with my mother via spanreed this morning." Shallan traced it with her eyes, noting Jasnah's explanation of the broken Soulcaster and her request for help. This happens more often than you'd think, Navani had replied. The failing likely has to do with the alignment of the gem housings. Bring me the device, and we shall see. "My mother," Jasnah said, "is a renowned artifabrian. I suspect she can make yours function again. We can send it to your brothers, who can return it to its owners." "You'd let me do that?" Shallan asked. During their days sailing, Shallan had cautiously pried for more information about the sect, hoping to understand her father and his motives. Jasnah claimed to know very little of them beyond the fact that they wanted her research, and were willing to kill for it. "I don't particularly want them having access to such a valuable device," Jasnah said. "But I don't have time to protect your family right now directly. This is a workable solution, assuming your brothers can stall a while longer. Have them tell the truth, if they mustthat you, knowing I was a scholar, came to me and asked me to fix the Soulcaster. Perhaps that will sate them for now." "Thank you, Brightness." Storms. If she'd just gone to Jasnah in the first place, after being accepted as her ward, how much easier would it have been? Shallan looked down at the paper, noticing that the conversation continued. As for the other matter, Navani wrote, I'm very fond of this suggestion. I believe I can persuade the boy to at least consider it, as his most recent affair ended quite abruptlyas is common with himearlier in the week. "What is this second part?" Shallan asked, looking up from the paper. "Sating the Ghostbloods alone will not save your house," Jasnah said. "Your debts are too great, particularly considering your father's actions in alienating so many. I have therefore arranged a powerful alliance for your house." "Alliance? How?" Jasnah took a deep breath. She seemed reluctant to explain. "I have taken the initial steps in arranging for you to be betrothed to one of my cousins, son of my uncle Dalinar Kholin. The boy's name is Adolin. He is handsome and wellacquainted with amiable discourse." "Betrothed?" Shallan said. "You've promised him my hand?" "I have started the process," Jasnah said, speaking with uncharacteristic anxiety. "Though at times he lacks foresight, Adolin has a good heartas good as that of his father, who may be the best man I have ever known. He is considered Alethkar's most eligible son, and my mother has long wanted him wed." "Betrothed," Shallan repeated. "Yes. Is that distressing?" "It's wonderful!" Shallan exclaimed, grabbing Jasnah's arm more tightly. "So easy. If I'm married to someone so powerful . . . Storms! Nobody would dare touch us in Jah Keved. It would solve many of our problems. Brightness Jasnah, you're a genius!" Jasnah relaxed visibly. "Yes, well, it did seem a workable solution. I had wondered, however, if you'd be offended." "Why on the winds would I be offended?" "Because of the restriction of freedom implicit in a marriage," Jasnah said. "And if not that, because the offer was made without consulting you. I had to see if the possibility was even open first. It has proceeded further than I'd expected, as my mother has seized on the idea. Navani has . . . a tendency toward the overwhelming." Shallan had trouble imagining anyone overwhelming Jasnah. "Stormfather! You're worried I'd be offended? Brightness, I spent my entire life locked in my father's manorI grew up assuming he'd pick my husband." "But you're free of your father now." "Yes, and I was so perfectly wise in my own pursuit of relationships," Shallan said. "The first man I chose was not only an ardent, but secretly an assassin." "It doesn't bother you at all?" Jasnah said. "The idea of being beholden to another, particularly a man?" "It's not like I'm being sold into slavery," Shallan said with a laugh. "No. I suppose not." Jasnah shook herself, her poise returning. "Well, I will let Navani know you are amenable to the engagement, and we should have a causal in place within the day." A causala conditional betrothal, in Vorin terminology. She would be, for all intents and purposes, engaged, but would have no legal footing until an official betrothal was signed and verified by the ardents. "The boy's father has said he will not force Adolin into anything," Jasnah explained, "though the boy is recently single, as he has managed to offend yet another young lady. Regardless, Dalinar would rather you two meet before anything more binding is agreed upon. There have been . . . shifts in the political climate of the Shattered Plains. A great loss to my uncle's army. Another reason for us to hasten to the Plains." "Adolin Kholin," Shallan said, listening with half an ear. "A duelist. A fantastic one. And even a Shardbearer." "Ah, so you were paying attention to your readings about my father and family." "I wasbut I knew about your family before that. The Alethi are the center of society! Even girls from rural houses know the names of the Alethi princes." And she'd be lying if she denied youthful daydreams of meeting one. "But Brightness, are you certain this match will be wise? I mean, I'm hardly the most important of individuals." "Well, yes. The daughter of another highprince might have been preferable for Adolin. However, it seems that he has managed to offend each and every one of the eligible women of that rank. The boy is, shall we say, somewhat overeager about relationships. Nothing you can't work through, I'm sure." "Stormfather," Shallan said, feeling her legs go weak. "He's heir to a princedom! He's in line to the throne of Alethkar itself!" "Third in line," Jasnah said, "behind my brother's infant son and Dalinar, my uncle." "Brightness, I have to ask. Why Adolin? Why not the younger son? II have nothing to offer Adolin, or the house." "On the contrary," Jasnah said, "if you are what I think you are, then you will be able to offer him something nobody else can. Something more important than riches." "What is it you think that I am?" Shallan whispered, meeting the older woman's eyes, finally asking the question that she hadn't dared. "Right now, you are but a promise," Jasnah said. "A chrysalis with the potential for grandeur inside. When once humans and spren bonded, the results were women who danced in the skies and men who could destroy the stones with a touch." "The Lost Radiants. Traitors to mankind." She couldn't absorb it all. The betrothal, Shadesmar and the spren, and this, her mysterious destiny. She'd known. But speaking it . . . She sank down, heedless of getting her dress wet on the deck, and sat with her back against the bulwark. Jasnah allowed her to compose herself before, amazingly, sitting down herself. She did so with far more poise, tucking her dress underneath her legs as she sat sideways. They both drew looks from the sailors. "They're going to chew me to pieces," Shallan said. "The Alethi court. It's the most ferocious in the world." Jasnah snorted. "It's more bluster than storm, Shallan. I will train you." "I'll never be like you, Brightness. You have power, authority, wealth. Just look how the sailors respond to you." "Am I specifically using said power, authority, or wealth right now?" "You paid for this trip." "Did you not pay for several trips on this ship?" Jasnah asked. "They did not treat you the same as they do me?" "No. Oh, they are fond of me. But I don't have your weight, Jasnah." "I will assume that did not have implications toward my girth," Jasnah said with a hint of a smile. "I understand your argument, Shallan. It is, however, dead wrong." Shallan turned to her. Jasnah sat upon the deck of the ship as if it were a throne, back straight, head up, commanding. Shallan sat with her legs against her chest, arms around them below the knees. Even the ways they sat were different. She was nothing like this woman. "There is a secret you must learn, child," Jasnah said. "A secret that is even more important than those relating to Shadesmar and spren. Power is an illusion of perception." Shallan frowned. "Don't mistake me," Jasnah continued. "Some kinds of power are real power to command armies, power to Soulcast. These come into play far less often than you would think. On an individual basis, in most interactions, this thing we call powerauthorityexists only as it is perceived. "You say I have wealth. This is true, but you have also seen that I do not often use it. You say I have authority as the sister of a king. I do. And yet, the men of this ship would treat me exactly the same way if I were a beggar who had convinced them I was the sister to a king. In that case, my authority is not a real thing. It is mere vaporsan illusion. I can create that illusion for them, as can you." "I'm not convinced, Brightness." "I know. If you were, you would be doing it already." Jasnah stood up, brushing off her skirt. "You will tell me if you see that patternthe one that appeared on the wavesagain?" "Yes, Brightness," Shallan said, distracted. "Then take the rest of the day for your art. I need to consider how to best teach you of Shadesmar." The older woman retreated, nodding at the bows of sailors as she passed and went back down belowdecks. Shallan rose, then turned and grabbed the railing, one hand to either side of the bowsprit. The ocean spread before her, rippling waves, a scent of cold freshness. Rhythmic crashing as the sloop pushed through the waves. Jasnah's words fought in her mind, like skyeels with only one rat between them. Spren with cities? Shadesmar, a realm that was here, but unseen? Shallan, suddenly betrothed to the single most important bachelor in the world? She left the bow, walking along the side of the ship, freehand trailing on the railing. How did the sailors regard her? They smiled, they waved. They liked her. Yalb, who hung lazily from the rigging nearby, called to her, telling her that in the next port, there was a statue she had to go visit. "It's this giant foot, young miss. Just a foot! Never finished the blustering statue . . ." She smiled to him and continued. Did she want them to look at her as they looked at Jasnah? Always afraid, always worried that they might do something wrong? Was that power? When I first sailed from Vedenar, she thought, reaching the place where her box had been tied, the captain kept urging me to go home. He saw my mission as a fool's errand. Tozbek had always acted as if he were doing her a favor in conveying her after Jasnah. Should she have had to spend that entire time feeling as if she'd imposed upon him and his crew by hiring them? Yes, he had offered a discount to her because of her father's business with him in the pastbut she'd still been employing him. The way he'd treated her was probably a thing of Thaylen merchants. If a captain could make you feel like you were imposing on him, you'd pay better. She liked the man, but their relationship left something to be desired. Jasnah would never have stood for being treated in such a way. That santhid still swam alongside. It was like a tiny, mobile island, its back overgrown with seaweed, small crystals jutting up from the shell. Shallan turned and walked toward the stern, where Captain Tozbek spoke with one of his mates, pointing at a map covered with glyphs. He nodded to her as she approached. "Just a warning, young miss," he said. "The ports will soon grow less accommodating. We'll be leaving Longbrow's Straits, curving around the eastern edge of the continent, toward New Natanan. There's nothing of worth between here and the Shallow Cryptsand even that's not much of a sight. I wouldn't send my own brother ashore there without guards, and he's killed seventeen men with his bare hands, he has." "I understand, Captain," Shallan said. "And thank you. I've revised my earlier decision. I need you to halt the ship and let me inspect the specimen swimming beside us." He sighed, reaching up and running his fingers along one of his stiff, spiked eyebrowsmuch as other men might play with their mustaches. "Brightness, that's not advisable. Stormfather! If I dropped you in the ocean . . ." "Then I would be wet," Shallan said. "It is a state I've experienced one or two times in my life." "No, I simply cannot allow it. Like I said, we'll take you to see some shells in " "Cannot allow it?" Shallan interrupted. She regarded him with what she hoped was a look of puzzlement, hoping he didn't see how tightly she squeezed her hands closed at her sides. Storms, but she hated confrontation. "I wasn't aware I had made a request you had the power to allow or disallow, Captain. Stop the ship. Lower me down. That is your order." She tried to say it as forcefully as Jasnah would. The woman could make it seem easier to resist a full highstorm than to disagree with her. Tozbek worked his mouth for a moment, no sound coming out, as if his body were trying to continue his earlier objection but his mind had been delayed. "It is my ship . . ." he finally said. "Nothing will be done to your ship," Shallan said. "Let's be quick about it, Captain. I do not wish to overly delay our arrival in port tonight." She left him, walking back to her box, heart thumping, hands trembling. She sat down, partially to calm herself. Tozbek, sounding profoundly annoyed, began calling orders. The sails were lowered, the ship slowed. Shallan breathed out, feeling a fool. And yet, what Jasnah said worked. The way Shallan acted created something in the eyes of Tozbek. An illusion? Like the spren themselves, perhaps? Fragments of human expectation, given life? The santhid slowed with them. Shallan rose, nervous, as sailors approached with rope. They reluctantly tied a loop at the bottom she could put her foot in, then explained that she should hold tightly to the rope as she was lowered. They tied a second, smaller rope securely around her waistthe means by which to haul her, wet and humiliated, back onto the deck. An inevitability, in their eyes. She took off her shoes, then climbed up over the railing as instructed. Had it been this windy before? She had a moment of vertigo, standing there with socked toes gripping a tiny rim, dress fluttering in the coursing winds. A windspren zipped up to her, then formed into the shape of a face with clouds behind it. Storms, the thing had better not interfere. Was it human imagination that had given windspren their mischievous spark? She stepped unsteadily into the rope loop as the sailors lowered it down beside her feet, then Yalb handed her the mask he'd told her of. Jasnah appeared from belowdecks, looking about in confusion. She saw Shallan standing off the side of the ship, and then cocked an eyebrow. Shallan shrugged, then gestured to the men to lower her. She refused to let herself feel silly as she inched toward the waters and the reclusive animal bobbing in the waves. The men stopped her a foot or two above the water, and she put on the mask, held by straps, covering most of her face including the nose. "Lower!" she shouted up at them. She thought she could feel their reluctance in the lethargic way the rope descended. Her foot hit the water, and a biting cold shot up her leg. Stormfather! But she didn't have them stop. She let them lower her farther until her legs were submerged in the frigid water. Her skirt ballooned out in a most annoying way, and she actually had to step on the end of itinside the loopto prevent it from rising up about her waist and floating on the water's surface as she submerged. She wrestled with the fabric for a moment, glad the men above couldn't see her blushing. Once it got wetter, though, it was easier to manage. She finally was able to squat, still holding tightly to the rope, and go down into the water up to her waist. Then she ducked her head under the water. Light streamed down from the surface in shimmering, radiant columns. There was life here, furious, amazing life. Tiny fish zipped this way and that, picking at the underside of the shell that shaded a majestic creature. Gnarled like an ancient tree, with rippled and folded skin, the true form of the santhid was a beast with long, drooping blue tendrils, like those of a jellyfish, only far thicker. Those disappeared down into the depths, trailing behind the beast at a slant. The beast itself was a knotted greyblue mass underneath the shell. Its ancientlooking folds surrounded one large eye on her sidepresumably, its twin would be on the other side. It seemed ponderous, yet majestic, with mighty fins moving like oarsmen. A group of strange spren shaped like arrows moved through the water here around the beast. Schools of fish darted about. Though the depths seemed empty, the area just around the santhid teemed with life, as did the area under the ship. Tiny fish picked at the bottom of the vessel. They'd move between the santhid and the ship, sometimes alone, sometimes in waves. Was this why the creature swam up beside a vessel? Something to do with the fish, and their relationship to it? She looked upon the creature, and its eyeas big as her headrolled toward her, focusing, seeing her. In that moment, Shallan couldn't feel the cold. She couldn't feel embarrassed. She was looking into a world that, so far as she knew, no scholar had ever visited. She blinked her eyes, taking a Memory of the creature, collecting it for later sketching. Our first clue was the Parshendi. Even weeks before they abandoned their pursuit of the gemhearts, their pattern of fighting changed. They lingered on the plateaus after battles, as if waiting for something. From the personal journal of Navani Kholin, Jeseses 1174 Breath. A man's breath was his life. Exhaled, bit by bit, back into the world. Kaladin breathed deeply, eyes closed, and for a time that was all he could hear. His own life. In, out, to the beating of the thunder in his chest. Breath. His own little storm. Outside, the rain had stopped. Kaladin remained sitting in the darkness. When kings and wealthy lighteyes died, their bodies weren't burned like those of common men. Instead, they were Soulcast into statues of stone or metal, forever frozen. The darkeyes' bodies were burned. They became smoke, to rise toward the heavens and whatever waited there, like a burned prayer. Breath. The breath of a lighteyes was no different from that of a darkeyes. No more sweet, no more free. The breath of kings and slaves mingled, to be breathed by men again, over and over. Kaladin stood up and opened his eyes. He'd spent the highstorm in the darkness of this small room alongside Bridge Four's new barrack. Alone. He walked to the door, but stopped. He rested his fingers on a cloak he knew hung from a hook there. In the darkness, he could not make out its deep blue color, nor the Kholin glyphin the shape of Dalinar's sigilon the back. It seemed that every change in his life had been marked by a storm. This was a big one. He shoved open the door and stepped out into the light as a free man. He left the cloak, for now. Bridge Four cheered him as he emerged. They had gone out to bathe and shave in the riddens of the storm, as was their custom. The line was almost done, Rock having shaved each of the men in turn. The large Horneater hummed to himself as he worked the razor over Drehy's balding head. The air smelled wet from the rain, and a washedout firepit nearby was the only trace of the stew the group had shared the night before. In many ways, this place wasn't so different from the lumberyards his men had recently escaped. The long, rectangular stone barracks were much the same Soulcast rather than having been built by hand, they looked like enormous stone logs. These, however, each had a couple of smaller rooms on the sides for sergeants, with their own doors that opened to the outside. They'd been painted with the symbols of the platoons using them before; Kaladin's men would have to paint over those. "Moash," Kaladin called. "Skar, Teft." The three jogged toward him, splashing through puddles left by the storm. They wore the clothing of bridgemen: simple trousers cut off at the knees, and leather vests over bare chests. Skar was up and mobile despite the wound to his foot, and he tried rather obviously not to limp. For now, Kaladin didn't order him to bed rest. The wound wasn't too bad, and he needed the man. "I want to look at what we've got," Kaladin said, leading them away from the barrack. It would house fifty men along with a halfdozen sergeants. More barracks flanked it on either side. Kaladin had been given an entire block of themtwenty buildingsto house his new battalion of former bridgemen. Twenty buildings. That Dalinar should so easily be able to find a block of twenty buildings for the bridgemen bespoke a terrible truththe cost of Sadeas's betrayal. Thousands of men dead. Indeed, female scribes worked near some of the barracks, supervising parshmen who carried out heaps of clothing and other personal effects. The possessions of the deceased. Not a few of those scribes looked on with red eyes and frazzled composures. Sadeas had just created thousands of new widows in Dalinar's camp, and likely as many orphans. If Kaladin had needed another reason to hate that man, he found it here, manifest in the suffering of those whose husbands had trusted him on the battlefield. In Kaladin's eyes, there was no sin greater than the betrayal of one's allies in battle. Except, perhaps, for the betrayal of one's own menof murdering them after they risked their lives to protect you. Kaladin felt an immediate flare of anger at thoughts of Amaram and what he'd done. His slave brand seemed to burn again on his forehead. Amaram and Sadeas. Two men in Kaladin's life who would, at some point, need to pay for the things they'd done. Preferably, that payment would come with severe interest. Kaladin continued to walk with Teft, Moash, and Skar. These barracks, which were slowly being emptied of personal effects, were also crowded with bridgemen. They looked much like the men of Bridge Foursame vests and kneetrousers. And yet, in some other ways, they couldn't have looked less like the men of Bridge Four. Shaggyhaired with beards that hadn't been trimmed in months, they bore hollow eyes that didn't seem to blink often enough. Slumped backs. Expressionless faces. Each man among them seemed to sit alone, even when surrounded by his fellows. "I remember that feeling," Skar said softly. The short, wiry man had sharp features and silvering hair at the temples, despite being in his early thirties. "I don't want to, but I do." "We're supposed to turn those into an army?" Moash asked. "Kaladin did it to Bridge Four, didn't he?" Teft asked, wagging a finger at Moash. "He'll do it again." "Transforming a few dozen men is different from doing the same for hundreds," Moash said, kicking aside a fallen branch from the highstorm. Tall and solid, Moash had a scar on his chin but no slave brand on his forehead. He walked straightbacked with his chin up. Save for those dark brown eyes of his, he could have passed for an officer. Kaladin led the three past barrack after barrack, doing a quick count. Nearly a thousand men, and though he'd told them yesterday that they were now free and could return to their old lives if they wishedfew seemed to want to do anything but sit. Though there had originally been forty bridge crews, many had been slaughtered during the latest assault and others had already been shortmanned. "We'll combine them into twenty crews," Kaladin said, "of about fifty each." Above, Syl fluttered down as a ribbon of light and zipped around him. The men gave no sign of seeing her; she would be invisible to them. "We can't teach each of these thousand personally, not at first. We'll want to train the more eager ones among them, then send them back to lead and train their own teams." "I suppose," Teft said, scratching his chin. The oldest of the bridgemen, he was one of the few who retained a beard. Most of the others had shaved theirs off as a mark of pride, something to separate the men of Bridge Four from common slaves. Teft kept his neat for the same reason. It was light brown where it hadn't gone grey, and he wore it short and square, almost like an ardent's. Moash grimaced, looking at the bridgemen. "You assume some of them will be 'more eager,' Kaladin. They all look the same level of despondent to me." "Some will still have fight in them," Kaladin said, continuing on back toward Bridge Four. "The ones who joined us at the fire last night, for a start. Teft, I'll need you to choose others. Organize and combine crews, then pick forty men two from each teamto be trained first. You'll be in command of that training. Those forty will be the seed we use to help the rest." "I suppose I can do that." "Good. I'll give you a few men to help." "A few?" Teft asked. "I could use more than a few. . . ." "You'll have to make do with a few," Kaladin said, stopping on the path and turning westward, toward the king's complex beyond the camp wall. It rose on a hillside overlooking the rest of the warcamps. "Most of us are going to be needed to keep Dalinar Kholin alive." Moash and the others stopped beside him. Kaladin squinted at the palace. It certainly didn't look grand enough to house a kingout here, everything was just stone and more stone. "You are willing to trust Dalinar?" Moash asked. "He gave up his Shardblade for us," Kaladin said. "He owed it to us," Skar said with a grunt. "We saved his storming life." "It could have just been posturing," Moash said, folding his arms. "Political games, him and Sadeas trying to manipulate each other." Syl alighted on Kaladin's shoulder, taking the form of a young woman with a flowing, filmy dress, all bluewhite. She held her hands clasped together as she looked up at the king's complex, where Dalinar Kholin had gone to plan. He'd told Kaladin that he was going to do something that would anger a lot of people. I'm going to take away their games. . . . "We need to keep that man alive," Kaladin said, looking back to the others. "I don't know if I trust him, but he's the only person on these Plains who has shown even a hint of compassion for bridgemen. If he dies, do you want to guess how long it will take his successor to sell us back to Sadeas?" Skar snorted in derision. "I'd like to see them try with a Knight Radiant at our head." "I'm not a Radiant." "Fine, whatever," Skar said. "Whatever you are, it will be tough for them to take us from you." "You think I can fight them all, Skar?" Kaladin said, meeting the older man's eyes. "Dozens of Shardbearers? Tens of thousands of troops? You think one man could do that?" "Not one man," Skar said, stubborn. "You." "I'm not a god, Skar," Kaladin said. "I can't hold back the weight of ten armies." He turned to the other two. "We decided to stay here on the Shattered Plains. Why?" "What good would it do to run?" Teft asked, shrugging. "Even as free men, we'd just end up conscripted into one army or another out there in the hills. Either that, or we'd end up starving." Moash nodded. "This is as good a place as any, so long as we're free." "Dalinar Kholin is our best hope for a real life," Kaladin said. "Bodyguards, not conscripted labor. Free men, despite the brands on our foreheads. Nobody else will give us that. If we want freedom, we need to keep Dalinar Kholin alive." "And the Assassin in White?" Skar asked softly. They'd heard of what the man was doing around the world, slaughtering kings and highprinces in all nations. The news was the buzz of the warcamps, ever since reports had started trickling in through spanreed. The emperor of Azir, dead. Jah Keved in turmoil. A halfdozen other nations left without a ruler. "He already killed our king," Kaladin said. "Old Gavilar was the assassin's first murder. We'll just have to hope he's done here. Either way, we protect Dalinar. At all costs." They nodded one by one, though those nods were grudging. He didn't blame them. Trusting lighteyes hadn't gotten them fareven Moash, who had once spoken well of Dalinar, now seemed to have lost his fondness for the man. Or any lighteyes. In truth, Kaladin was a little surprised at himself and the trust he felt. But, storm it, Syl liked Dalinar. That carried weight. "We're weak right now," Kaladin said, lowering his voice. "But if we play along with this for a time, protecting Kholin, we'll be paid handsomely. I'll be able to train youreally train youas soldiers and officers. Beyond that, we'll be able to teach these others. "We could never make it on our own out there as two dozen former bridgemen. But what if we were instead a highly skilled mercenary force of a thousand soldiers, equipped with the finest gear in the warcamps? If worst comes to worst, and we have to abandon the camps, I'd like to do so as a cohesive unit, hardened and impossible to ignore. Give me a year with this thousand, and I can have it done." "Now that plan I like," Moash said. "Do I get to learn to use a sword?" "We're still darkeyes, Moash." "Not you," Skar said from his other side. "I saw your eyes during the" "Stop!" Kaladin said. He took a deep breath. "Just stop. No more talk of that." Skar fell silent. "I am going to name you officers," Kaladin said to them. "You three, along with Sigzil and Rock. You'll be lieutenants." "Darkeyed lieutenants?" Skar said. The rank was commonly used for the equivalent of sergeants in companies made up only of lighteyes. "Dalinar made me a captain," Kaladin said. "The highest rank he said he dared commission a darkeyes. Well, I need to come up with a full command structure for a thousand men, and we're going to need something between sergeant and captain. That means appointing you five as lieutenants. I think Dalinar will let me get away with it. We'll make master sergeants if we need another rank. "Rock is going to be quartermaster and in charge of food for the thousand. I'll appoint Lopen his second. Teft, you'll be in charge of training. Sigzil will be our clerk. He's the only one who can read glyphs. Moash and Skar . . ." He glanced toward the two men. One short, the other tall, they walked the same way, with a smooth gait, dangerous, spears always on their shoulders. They were never without. Of all the men he'd trained in Bridge Four, only these two had instinctively understood. They were killers. Like Kaladin himself. "We three," Kaladin told them, "are each going to focus on watching Dalinar Kholin. Whenever possible, I want one of us three personally guarding him. Often one of the other two will watch his sons, but make no mistake, the Blackthorn is the man we're going to keep alive. At all costs. He is our only guarantee of freedom for Bridge Four." The others nodded. "Good," Kaladin said. "Let's go get the rest of the men. It's time for the world to see you as I do." * * * By common agreement, Hobber sat down to get his tattoo first. The gaptoothed man was one of the very first who had believed in Kaladin. Kaladin remembered that day; exhausted after a bridge run, wanting to simply lie down and stare. Instead, he'd chosen to save Hobber rather than letting him die. Kaladin had saved himself that day too. The rest of Bridge Four stood around Hobber in the tent, watching in silence as the tattooist worked carefully on his forehead, covering up the scar of his slave's brand with the glyphs Kaladin had provided. Hobber winced now and then at the pain of the tattoo, but he kept a grin on his face. Kaladin had heard that you could cover a scar with a tattoo, and it ended up working quite well. Once the tattoo ink was injected, the glyphs drew the eye, and you could barely tell that the skin beneath was scarred. Once the process was finished, the tattooist provided a mirror for Hobber to look into. The bridgeman touched his forehead hesitantly. The skin was red from the needles, but the dark tattoo perfectly covered the slave brand. "What does it say?" Hobber asked softly, tears in his eyes. "Freedom," Sigzil said before Kaladin could reply. "The glyph means freedom." "The smaller ones above," Kaladin said, "say the date you were freed and the one who freed you. Even if you lose your writ of freedom, anyone who tries to imprison you for being a runaway can easily find proof that you are not. They can go to Dalinar Kholin's scribes, who keep a copy of your writ." Hobber nodded. "That's good, but it's not enough. Add 'Bridge Four' to it. Freedom, Bridge Four." "To imply you were freed from Bridge Four?" "No, sir. I wasn't freed from Bridge Four. I was freed by it. I wouldn't trade my time there for anything." It was crazy talk. Bridge Four had been deathscores of men had been slaughtered running that cursed bridge. Even after Kaladin had determined to save the men, he'd lost far too many. Hobber would have been a fool not to take any opportunity to escape. And yet, he sat stubbornly until Kaladin drew out the proper glyphs for the tattooista calm, sturdy darkeyed woman who looked like she could have lifted a bridge all on her own. She settled down on her stool and began adding the two glyphs to Hobber's forehead, tucked right below the freedom glyph. She spent the process explainingagainhow the tattoo would be sore for days and how Hobber would need to care for it. He accepted the new tattoos with a grin on his face. Pure foolishness, but the others nodded in agreement, clasping Hobber on the arm. Once Hobber was done, Skar sat quickly, eager, demanding the same full set of tattoos. Kaladin stepped back, folding his arms and shaking his head. Outside the tent, a bustling marketplace sold and bought. The "warcamp" was really a city, built up inside the craterlike rim of some enormous rock formation. The prolonged war on the Shattered Plains had attracted merchants of all varieties, along with tradesmen, artists, and even families with children. Moash stood nearby, face troubled, watching the tattooist. He wasn't the only one in the bridge crew who didn't have a slave brand. Teft didn't either. They had been made bridgemen without technically being made slaves first. It happened frequently in Sadeas's camp, where running bridges was a punishment that one could earn for all manner of infractions. "If you don't have a slave's brand," Kaladin said loudly to the men, "you don't need to get the tattoo. You're still one of us." "No," Rock said. "I will get this thing." He insisted on sitting down after Skar and getting the tattoo right on his forehead, though he had no slave brand. Indeed, every one of the men without a slave brandBeld and Teft included sat down and got the tattoo on their foreheads. Only Moash abstained, and had the tattoo placed on his upper arm. Good. Unlike most of them, he wouldn't have to go about with a proclamation of former slavery in plain view. Moash stood up from the seat, and another took his place. A man with red and black skin in a marbled pattern, like stone. Bridge Four had a lot of variety, but Shen was in a class all his own. A parshman. "I can't tattoo him," the artist said. "He's property." Kaladin opened his mouth to object, but the other bridgemen jumped in first. "He's been freed, like us," Teft said. "One of the team," Hobber said. "Give him the tattoo, or you won't see a sphere from any of us." He blushed after he said it, glancing at Kaladinwho would be paying for all this, using spheres granted by Dalinar Kholin. Other bridgemen spoke out, and the tattoo artist finally sighed and gave in. She pulled over her stool and began working on Shen's forehead. "You won't even be able to see it," she grumbled, though Sigzil's skin was nearly as dark as Shen's, and the tattoo showed up fine on him. Eventually, Shen looked in the mirror, then stood up. He glanced at Kaladin, and nodded. Shen didn't say much, and Kaladin didn't know what to make of the man. It was actually easy to forget about him, usually trailing along silently at the back of the group of bridgemen. Invisible. Parshmen were often that way. Shen finished, only Kaladin himself remained. He sat down next and closed his eyes. The pain of the needles was a lot sharper than he'd anticipated. After a short time, the tattooist started cursing under her breath. Kaladin opened his eyes as she wiped a rag on his forehead. "What is it?" he asked. "The ink won't take!" she said. "I've never seen anything like it. When I wipe your forehead, the ink all just comes right off! The tattoo won't stay." Kaladin sighed, realizing he had a little Stormlight raging in his veins. He hadn't even noticed drawing it in, but he seemed to be getting better and better at holding it. He frequently took in a little these days while walking about. Holding Stormlight was like filling a wineskinif you filled it to bursting and unstopped it, it would squirt out quickly, then slow to a trickle. Same with the Light. He banished it, hoping the tattoo artist didn't notice when he breathed out a small cloud of glowing smoke. "Try again," he said as she got out new ink. This time, the tattoo took. Kaladin sat through the process, teeth clenched against the pain, then looked up as she held the mirror for him. The face that looked back at Kaladin seemed alien. Cleanshaven, hair pulled back from his face for the tattooing, the slave brands covered up and, for the moment, forgotten. Can I be this man again? he thought, reaching up, touching his cheek. This man died, didn't he? Syl landed on his shoulder, joining him in looking into the mirror. "Life before death, Kaladin," she whispered. He unconsciously sucked in Stormlight. Just a little, a fraction of a sphere's worth. It flowed through his veins like a wave of pressure, like winds trapped in a small enclosure. The tattoo on his forehead melted. His body shoved out the ink, which started to drip down his face. The tattooist cursed again and grabbed her rag. Kaladin was left with the image of those glyphs melting away. Freedom dissolved, and underneath, the violent scars of his captivity. Dominated by a branded glyph. Shash. Dangerous. The woman wiped his face. "I don't know why this is happening! I thought it would stay that time. I" "It's all right," Kaladin said, taking the rag as he stood, finishing the cleanup. He turned to face the rest of them, bridgemen now soldiers. "The scars haven't finished with me yet, it appears. I'll try again another time." They nodded. He'd have to explain to them later what was happening; they knew of his abilities. "Let's go," Kaladin said to them, tossing a small bag of spheres to the tattooist, then taking his spear from beside the tent entrance. The others joined him, spears to shoulders. They didn't need to be armed while in camp, but he wanted them to get used to the idea that they were free to carry weapons now. The market outside was crowded and vibrant. The tents, of course, would have been taken down and stowed during last night's highstorm, but they'd already sprung up again. Perhaps because he was thinking about Shen, he noticed the parshmen. He picked out dozens of them with a cursory glance, helping set up a few last tents, carrying purchases for lighteyes, helping shopowners stack their wares. What do they think of this war on the Shattered Plains? Kaladin wondered. A war to defeat, and perhaps subjugate, the only free parshmen in the world? Would that he could get an answer out of Shen regarding questions like that. It seemed all he ever got from the parshman were shrugs. Kaladin led his men through the market, which seemed far friendlier than the one in Sadeas's camp. Though people stared at the bridgemen, nobody sneered, and the haggling at nearby standswhile energeticdidn't progress to shouting. There even seemed to be fewer urchins and beggars. You just want to believe that, Kaladin thought. You want to believe Dalinar is the man everyone says he is. The honorable lighteyes of the stories. But everyone said the same things about Amaram. As they walked, they did pass some soldiers. Too few. Men who had been on duty back in the camp when the others had gone on the disastrous assault where Sadeas had betrayed Dalinar. As they passed one group patrolling the market, Kaladin caught two men at their front raising their hands before themselves, crossed at the wrist. How had they learned Bridge Four's old salute, and so quickly? These men didn't do it as a full salute, just a small gesture, but they nodded their heads to Kaladin and his men as they passed. Suddenly, the more calm nature of the market took on another cast to Kaladin. Perhaps this wasn't simply the order and organization of Dalinar's army. There was an air of quiet dread over this warcamp. Thousands had been lost to Sadeas's betrayal. Everyone here had probably known a man who had died out on those plateaus. And everyone probably wondered if the conflict between the two highprinces would escalate. "It's nice to be seen as a hero, isn't it?" Sigzil asked, walking beside Kaladin and watching another group of soldiers pass by. "How long will the goodwill last, do you think?" Moash asked. "How long before they resent us?" "Ha!" Rock, towering behind him, clapped Moash on the shoulder. "No complaining today! You do this thing too much. Do not make me kick you. I do not like kicking. It hurts my toes." "Kick me?" Moash snorted. "You won't even carry a spear, Rock." "Spears are not for kicking complainers. But big Unkalaki feet like mineit is what they were made for! Ha! This thing is obvious, yes?" Kaladin led the men out of the market and to a large rectangular building near the barracks. This one was constructed of worked stone, rather than Soulcast rock, allowing far more finesse in design. Such buildings were becoming more common in the warcamps, as more masons arrived. Soulcasting was quicker, but also more expensive and less flexible. He didn't know much about it, only that Soulcasters were limited in what they could do. That was why the barracks were all essentially identical. Kaladin led his men inside the towering building to the counter, where a grizzled man with a belly that stretched to next week supervised a few parshmen stacking bolts of blue cloth. Rind, the Kholin head quartermaster, to whom Kaladin had sent instructions the night before. Rind was lighteyed, but what was known as a "tenner," a lowly rank barely above darkeyes. "Ah!" Rind said, speaking with a highpitched voice that did not match his girth. "You're here, finally! I've got them all out for you, Captain. Everything I have left." "Left?" Moash asked. "Uniforms of the Cobalt Guard! I've commissioned some new ones, but this is what stock remained." Rind grew more subdued. "Didn't expect to need so many so soon, you see." He looked Moash up and down, then handed him a uniform and pointed to a stall for changing. Moash took it. "We going to wear our leather jerkins over these?" "Ha!" Rind said. "The ones tied with so much bone you looked like some Western skullbearer on feast day? I've heard of that. But no, Brightlord Dalinar says you're each to be outfitted with breastplates, steel caps, new spears. Chain mail for the battlefield, if you need it." "For now," Kaladin said, "uniforms will do." "I think I'll look silly in this," Moash grumbled, but walked over to change. Rind distributed the uniforms to the men. He gave Shen a strange look, but delivered the parshman a uniform without complaint. The bridgemen gathered in an eager bunch, jabbering with excitement as they unfolded their uniforms. It had been a long time since any of them had worn anything other than bridgeman leathers or slave wraps. They stopped talking when Moash stepped out. These were newer uniforms, of a more modern style than Kaladin had worn in his previous military service. Stiff blue trousers and black boots polished to a shine. A buttoned white shirt, only the edges of its collar and cuffs extending beyond the jacket, which came down to the waist and buttoned closed beneath the belt. "Now, there's a soldier!" the quartermaster said with a laugh. "Still think you look silly?" He gestured for Moash to inspect his reflection in the mirror on the wall. Moash fixed his cuffs and actually blushed. Kaladin had rarely seen the man so out of sorts. "No," Moash said. "I don't." The others moved eagerly and began changing. Some went to the stalls at the side, but most didn't care. They were bridgemen and slaves; they'd spent most of their recent lives being paraded about in loincloths or little more. Teft had his on before anyone else, and knew to do up the buttons in the right places. "Been a long time," he whispered, buckling his belt. "Don't know that I deserve to wear something like this again." "This is what you are, Teft," Kaladin said. "Don't let the slave rule you." Teft grunted, affixing his combat knife in its place on his belt. "And you, son? When are you going to admit what you are?" "I have." "To us. Not to everyone else." "Don't start this again." "I'll storming start whatever I want," Teft snapped. He leaned in, speaking softly. "At least until you give me a real answer. You're a Surgebinder. You're not a Radiant yet, but you're going to be one when this is all blown through. The others are right to push you. Why don't you go have a hike up to that Dalinar fellow, suck in some Stormlight, and make him recognize you as a lighteyes?" Kaladin glanced at the men in a muddled jumble as they tried to get the uniforms on, an exasperated Rind explaining to them how to do up the coats. "Everything I've ever had, Teft," Kaladin whispered, "the lighteyes have taken from me. My family, my brother, my friends. More. More than you can imagine. They see what I have, and they take it." He held up his hand, and could faintly make out a few glowing wisps trailing from his skin, since he knew what to look for. "They'll take it. If they can find out what I do, they'll take it." "Now, how in Kelek's breath would they do that?" "I don't know," Kaladin said. "I don't know, Teft, but I can't help feeling panic when I think about it. I can't let them have this, can't let them take itor you menfrom me. We remain quiet about what I can do. No more talk of it." Teft grumbled as the other men finally got themselves sorted out, though Lopenone armed, with his empty sleeve turned inside out and pushed in so it didn't hang downprodded at the patch on his shoulder. "What's this?" "It's the insignia of the Cobalt Guard," Kaladin said. "Dalinar Kholin's personal bodyguard." "They're dead, gancho," Lopen said. "We aren't them." "Yeah," Skar agreed. To Rind's horror, he got out his knife and cut the patch free. "We're Bridge Four." "Bridge Four was your prison," Kaladin protested. "Doesn't matter," Skar said. "We're Bridge Four." The others agreed, cutting off the patches, tossing them to the ground. Teft nodded and did likewise. "We'll protect the Blackthorn, but we're not just going to replace what he had before. We're our own crew." Kaladin rubbed his forehead, but this was what he had accomplished in bringing them together, galvanizing them into a cohesive unit. "I'll draw up a glyphpair insignia for you to use," he told Rind. "You'll have to commission new patches." The portly man sighed as he gathered up the discarded patches. "I suppose. I've got your uniform over there, Captain. A darkeyed captain! Who would have thought it possible? You'll be the only one in the army. The only one ever, so far as I know!" He didn't seem to find it offensive. Kaladin had little experience with lowdahn lighteyes like Rind, though they were very common in the warcamps. In his hometown, there had only been the citylord's familyof uppermiddle dahn and the darkeyes. It hadn't been until he'd reached Amaram's army that he'd realized there was an entire spectrum of lighteyes, many of whom worked common jobs and scrambled for money just like ordinary people. Kaladin walked over to the last bundle on the counter. His uniform was different. It included a blue waistcoat and a doublebreasted blue longcoat, the lining white, the buttons of silver. The longcoat was meant to hang open, despite the rows of buttons down each side. He'd seen such uniforms frequently. On lighteyes. "Bridge Four," he said, cutting the Cobalt Guard insignia from the shoulder and tossing it to the counter with the others. Soldiers reported being watched from afar by an unnerving number of Parshendi scouts. Then we noticed a new pattern of their penetrating close to the camps in the night and then quickly retreating. I can only surmise that our enemies were even then preparing their stratagem to end this war. From the personal journal of Navani Kholin, Jeseses 1174 Research into times before the Hierocracy is frustratingly difficult, the book read. During the reign of the Hierocracy, the Vorin Church had nearabsolute control over eastern Roshar. The fabrications they promotedand then perpetuated as absolute truthbecame ingrained in the consciousness of society. More disturbingly, modified copies of ancient texts were made, aligning history to match Hierocratic dogma. In her cabin, Shallan read by the glow of a goblet of spheres, wearing her nightgown. Her cramped chamber lacked a true porthole and had just a thin slit of a window running across the top of the outside wall. The only sound she could hear was the water lapping against the hull. Tonight, the ship did not have a port in which to shelter. The church of this era was suspicious of the Knights Radiant, the book read. Yet it relied upon the authority granted Vorinism by the Heralds. This created a dichotomy in which the Recreance, and the betrayal of the knights, was overemphasized. At the same time, the ancient knightsthe ones who had lived alongside the Heralds in the shadowdayswere celebrated. This makes it particularly difficult to study the Radiants and the place named Shadesmar. What is fact? What records did the church, in its misguided attempt to cleanse the past of perceived contradictions, rewrite to suit its preferred narrative? Few documents from the period survive that did not pass through Vorin hands to be copied from the original parchment into modern codices. Shallan glanced up over the top of her book. The volume was one of Jasnah's earliest published works as a full scholar. Jasnah had not assigned Shallan to read it. Indeed, she'd been hesitant when Shallan had asked for a copy, and had needed to dig it out of one of the numerous trunks full of books she kept in the ship's hold. Why had she been so reluctant, when this volume dealt with the very things that Shallan was studying? Shouldn't Jasnah have given her this right off? It The pattern returned. Shallan's breath caught in her throat as she saw it on the cabin wall beside the bunk, just to her left. She carefully moved her eyes back to the page in front of her. The pattern was the same one that she'd seen before, the shape that had appeared on her sketchpad. Ever since then, she'd been seeing it from the corner of her eye, appearing in the grain of wood, the cloth on the back of a sailor's shirt, the shimmering of the water. Each time, when she looked right at it, the pattern vanished. Jasnah would say nothing more, other than to indicate it was likely harmless. Shallan turned the page and steadied her breathing. She had experienced something like this before with the strange symbolheaded creatures who had appeared unbidden in her drawings. She allowed her eyes to slip up off the page and look at the wallnot right at the pattern, but to the side of it, as if she hadn't noticed it. Yes, it was there. Raised, like an embossing, it had a complex pattern with a haunting symmetry. Its tiny lines twisted and turned through its mass, somehow lifting the surface of the wood, like iron scrollwork under a taut tablecloth. It was one of those things. The symbolheads. This pattern was similar to their strange heads. She looked back at the page, but did not read. The ship swayed, and the glowing white spheres in her goblet clinked as they shifted. She took a deep breath. Then looked directly at the pattern. Immediately, it began to fade, the ridges sinking. Before it did, she got a clear look at it, and she took a Memory. "Not this time," she muttered as it vanished. "This time I have you." She threw away her book, scrambling to get out her charcoal pencil and a sheet of sketching paper. She huddled down beside her light, red hair tumbling around her shoulders. She worked furiously, possessed by a frantic need to have this drawing done. Her fingers moved on their own, her unclothed safehand holding the sketchpad toward the goblet, which sprinkled the paper with shards of light. She tossed aside the pencil. She needed something crisper, capable of sharper lines. Ink. Pencil was wonderful for drawing the soft shades of life, but this thing she drew was not life. It was something else, something unreal. She dug a pen and inkwell from her supplies, then went back to her drawing, replicating the tiny, intricate lines. She did not think as she drew. The art consumed her, and creationspren popped into existence all around. Dozens of tiny shapes soon crowded the small table beside her cot and the floor of the cabin near where she knelt. The spren shifted and spun, each no larger than the bowl of a spoon, becoming shapes they'd recently encountered. She mostly ignored them, though she'd never seen so many at once. Faster and faster they shifted forms as she drew, intent. The pattern seemed impossible to capture. Its complex repetitions twisted down into infinity. No, a pen could never capture this thing perfectly, but she was close. She drew it spiraling out of a center point, then recreated each branch off the center, which had its own swirl of tiny lines. It was like a maze created to drive its captive insane. When she finished the last line, she found herself breathing hard, as if she'd run a great distance. She blinked, again noticing the creationspren around her there were hundreds. They lingered before fading away one by one. Shallan set the pen down beside her vial of ink, which she'd stuck to the tabletop with wax to keep it from sliding as the ship swayed. She picked up the page, waiting for the last lines of ink to dry, and felt as if she'd accomplished something significantthough she knew not what. As the last line dried, the pattern rose before her. She heard a distinct sigh from the paper, as if in relief. She jumped, dropping the paper and scrambling onto her bed. Unlike the other times, the embossing didn't vanish, though it left the paperbudding from her matching drawingand moved onto the floor. She could describe it in no other way. The pattern somehow moved from paper to floor. It came to the leg of her cot and wrapped around it, climbing upward and onto the blanket. It didn't look like something moving beneath the blanket; that was simply a crude approximation. The lines were too precise for that, and there was no stretching. Something beneath the blanket would have been just an indistinct lump, but this was exact. It drew closer. It didn't look dangerous, but she still found herself trembling. This pattern was different from the symbolheads in her drawings, but it was also somehow the same. A flattenedout version, without torso or limbs. It was an abstraction of one of them, just as a circle with a few lines in it could represent a human's face on the page. Those things had terrified her, haunted her dreams, made her worry she was going insane. So as this one approached, she scuttled from her bed and went as far from it in the small cabin as she could. Then, heart thumping in her chest, she pulled open the door to go for Jasnah. She found Jasnah herself just outside, reaching toward the doorknob, her left hand cupped before her. A small figure made of inky blacknessshaped like a man in a smart, fashionable suit with a long coatstood in her palm. He melted away into shadow as he saw Shallan. Jasnah looked to Shallan, then glanced toward the floor of the cabin, where the pattern was crossing the wood. "Put on some clothing, child," Jasnah said. "We have matters to discuss." * * * "I had originally hoped that we would have the same type of spren," Jasnah said, sitting on a stool in Shallan's cabin. The pattern remained on the floor between her and Shallan, who lay prone on the cot, properly clothed with a robe over the nightgown and a thin white glove on her left hand. "But of course, that would be too easy. I have suspected since Kharbranth that we would be of different orders." "Orders, Brightness?" Shallan asked, timidly using a pencil to prod at the pattern on the floor. It shied away, like an animal that had been poked. Shallan was fascinated by how it raised the surface of the floor, though a part of her did not want to have anything to do with it and its unnatural, eyetwisting geometries. "Yes," Jasnah said. The inklike spren that had accompanied her before had not reappeared. "Each order reportedly had access to two of the Surges, with overlap between them. We call the powers Surgebinding. Soulcasting was one, and is what we share, though our orders are different." Shallan nodded. Surgebinding. Soulcasting. These were talents of the Lost Radiants, the abilitiessupposedly just legendthat had been their blessing or their curse, depending upon which reports you read. Or so she'd learned from the books Jasnah had given her to read during their trip. "I'm not one of the Radiants," Shallan said. "Of course you aren't," Jasnah said, "and neither am I. The orders of knights were a construct, just as all society is a construct, used by men to define and explain. Not every man who wields a spear is a soldier, and not every woman who makes bread is a baker. And yet weapons, or baking, become the hallmarks of certain professions." "So you're saying that what we can do . . ." "Was once the definition of what initiated one into the Knights Radiant," Jasnah said. "But we're women!" "Yes," Jasnah said lightly. "Spren don't suffer from human society's prejudices. Refreshing, wouldn't you say?" Shallan looked up from poking at the pattern spren. "There were women among the Knights Radiant?" "A statistically appropriate number," Jasnah said. "But don't fear that you will soon find yourself swinging a sword, child. The archetype of Radiants on the battlefield is an exaggeration. From what I've readthough records are, unfortunately, untrustworthyfor every Radiant dedicated to battle, there were another three who spent their time on diplomacy, scholarship, or other ways to aid society." "Oh." Why was Shallan disappointed by that? Fool. A memory rose unbidden. A silvery sword. A pattern of light. Truths she could not face. She banished them, squeezing her eyes shut. Ten heartbeats. "I have been looking into the spren you told me about," Jasnah said. "The creatures with the symbol heads." Shallan took a deep breath and opened her eyes. "This is one of them," she said, pointing her pencil at the pattern, which had approached her trunk and was moving up onto it and off itlike a child jumping on a sofa. Instead of threatening, it seemed innocent, even playfuland hardly intelligent at all. She had been frightened of this thing? "Yes, I suspect that it is," Jasnah said. "Most spren manifest differently here than they do in Shadesmar. What you drew before was their form there." "This one is not very impressive." "Yes. I will admit that I'm disappointed. I feel that we're missing something important about this, Shallan, and I find it annoying. The Cryptics have a fearful reputation, and yet this onethe first specimen I've ever seenseems . . ." It climbed up the wall, then slipped down, then climbed back up, then slipped down again. "Imbecilic?" Shallan asked. "Perhaps it simply needs more time," Jasnah said. "When I first bonded with Ivory" She stopped abruptly. "What?" Shallan said. "I'm sorry. He does not like me to speak of him. It makes him anxious. The knights' breaking of their oaths was very painful to the spren. Many spren died; I'm certain of it. Though Ivory won't speak of it, I gather that what he's done is regarded as a betrayal by the others of his kind." "But" "No more of that," Jasnah said. "I'm sorry." "Fine. You mentioned the Cryptics?" "Yes," Jasnah said, reaching into the sleeve that hid her safehand and slipping out a folded piece of paperone of Shallan's drawings of the symbolheads. "That is their own name for themselves, though we would probably name them liespren. They don't like the term. Regardless, the Cryptics rule one of the greater cities in Shadesmar. Think of them as the lighteyes of the Cognitive Realm." "So this thing," Shallan said, nodding to the pattern, which was spinning in circles in the center of the cabin, "is like . . . a prince, on their side?" "Something like that. There is a complex sort of conflict between them and the honorspren. Spren politics are not something I've been able to devote much time to. This spren will be your companionand will grant you the ability to Soulcast, among other things." "Other things?" "We will have to see," Jasnah said. "It comes down to the nature of spren. What has your research revealed?" With Jasnah, everything seemed to be a test of scholarship. Shallan smothered a sigh. This was why she had come with Jasnah, rather than returning to her home. Still, she did wish that sometimes Jasnah would just tell her answers rather than making her work so hard to find them. "Alai says that the spren are fragments of the powers of creation. A lot of the scholars I read agreed with that." "It is one opinion. What does it mean?" Shallan tried not to let herself be distracted by the spren on the floor. "There are ten fundamental Surgesforcesby which the world works. Gravitation, pressure, transformation. That sort of thing. You told me spren are fragments of the Cognitive Realm that have somehow gained sentience because of human attention. Well, it stands to reason that they were something before. Like . . . like a painting was a canvas before being given life." "Life?" Jasnah said, raising her eyebrow. "Of course," Shallan said. Paintings lived. Not lived like a person or a spren, but . . . well, it was obvious to her, at least. "So, before the spren were alive, they were something. Power. Energy. ZendaughterVath sketched tiny spren she found sometimes around heavy objects. Gravitationsprenfragments of the power or force that causes us to fall. It stands to reason that every spren was a power before it was a spren. Really, you can divide spren into two general groups. Those that respond to emotions and those that respond to forces like fire or wind pressure." "So you believe Namar's theory on spren categorization?" "Yes." "Good," Jasnah said. "As do I. I suspect, personally, that these groupings of sprenemotion spren versus nature sprenare where the ideas of mankind's primeval 'gods' came from. Honor, who became Vorinism's Almighty, was created by men who wanted a representation of ideal human emotions as they saw in emotion spren. Cultivation, the god worshipped in the West, is a female deity that is an embodiment of nature and nature spren. The various Voidspren, with their unseen lordwhose name changes depending on which culture we're speaking ofevoke an enemy or antagonist. The Stormfather, of course, is a strange offshoot of this, his theoretical nature changing depending on which era of Vorinism is doing the talking. . . ." She trailed off. Shallan blushed, realizing she'd looked away and had begun tracing a glyphward on her blanket against the evil in Jasnah's words. "That was a tangent," Jasnah said. "I apologize." "You're so sure he isn't real," Shallan said. "The Almighty." "I have no more proof of him than I do of the Thaylen Passions, Nu Ralik of the Purelake, or any other religion." "And the Heralds? You don't think they existed?" "I don't know," Jasnah said. "There are many things in this world that I don't understand. For example, there is some slight proof that both the Stormfather and the Almighty are real creaturessimply powerful spren, such as the Nightwatcher." "Then he would be real." "I never claimed he was not," Jasnah said. "I merely claimed that I do not accept him as God, nor do I feel any inclination to worship him. But this is, again, a tangent." Jasnah stood. "You are relieved of other duties of study. For the next few days, you have only one focus for your scholarship." She pointed toward the floor. "The pattern?" Shallan asked. "You are the only person in centuries to have the chance to interact with a Cryptic," Jasnah said. "Study it and record your experiencesin detail. This will likely be your first writing of significance, and could be of utmost importance to our future." Shallan regarded the pattern, which had moved over and bumped into her foot she could feel it only faintlyand was now bumping into it time and time again. "Great," Shallan said. The next clue came on the walls. I did not ignore this sign, but neither did I grasp its full implications. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jeseses 1174 "I'm running through water," Dalinar said, coming to himself. He was moving, charging forward. The vision coalesced around him. Warm water splashed his legs. On either side of him, a dozen men with hammers and spears ran through the shallow water. They lifted their legs high with each step, feet back, thighs lifting parallel to the water's surface, like they were marching in a paradeonly no parade had ever been such a mad scramble. Obviously, running that way helped them move through the liquid. He tried to imitate the odd gait. "I'm in the Purelake, I think," he said, under his breath. "Warm water that only comes up to the knees, no signs of land anywhere. It's dusk, though, so I can't see much. "People run with me. I don't know if we're running toward something or away from it. Nothing over my shoulder that I can see. These people are obviously soldiers, though the uniforms are antiquated. Leather skirts, bronze helms and breastplates. Bare legs and arms." He looked down at himself. "I'm wearing the same." Some highlords in Alethkar and Jah Keved still used uniforms like this, so he couldn't place the exact era. The modern uses were all calculated revivals by traditionalist commanders who hoped a classical look would inspire their men. In those cases, however, modern steel equipment would be used alongside the antique uniformsand he didn't see any of that here. Dalinar didn't ask questions. He'd found that playing along with these visions taught him more than it did to stop and demand answers. Running through this water was tough. Though he'd started near the front of the group, he was now lagging behind. The group ran toward some kind of large rock mound ahead, shadowed in the dusk. Maybe this wasn't the Purelake. It didn't have rock formations like That wasn't a rock mound. It was a fortress. Dalinar halted, looking up at the peaked, castlelike structure that rose straight from the still lake waters. He'd never seen its like before. Jetblack stone. Obsidian? Perhaps this place had been Soulcast. "There's a fortress ahead," he said, continuing forward. "It must not still exist if it did, it would be famous. It looks like it's created entirely from obsidian. Finlike sides rising toward peaked tips above, towers like arrowheads . . . Stormfather. It's majestic. "We're approaching another group of soldiers who stand in the water, holding spears wardingly in all directions. There are perhaps a dozen of them; I'm in the company of another dozen. And . . . yes, there's someone in the middle of them. Shardbearer. Glowing armor." Not just a Shardbearer. Radiant. A knight in resplendent Shardplate that glowed with a deep red at the joints and in certain markings. Armor did that in the shadowdays. This vision was taking place before the Recreance. Like all Shardplate, the armor was distinctive. With that skirt of chain links, those smooth joints, the vambraces that extended back just so . . . Storms, that looked like Adolin's armor, though this armor pulled in more at the waist. Female? Dalinar couldn't tell for certain, as the faceplate was down. "Form up!" the knight ordered as Dalinar's group arrived, and he nodded to himself. Yes, female. Dalinar and the other soldiers formed a ring around the knight, weapons outward. Not far off, another group of soldiers with a knight at their center marched through the water. "Why did you call us back?" asked one of Dalinar's companions. "Caeb thinks he saw something," the knight said. "Be alert. Let's move carefully." The group started away from the fortress in another direction from the one they'd come. Dalinar held his spear outward, sweating at his temples. To his own eyes, he didn't look any different from his normal self. The others, however, would see him as one of their own. He still didn't know terribly much about these visions. The Almighty sent them to him, somehow. But the Almighty was dead, by his own admission. So how did that work? "We're looking for something," Dalinar said, under his breath. "Teams of knights and soldiers have been sent into the night to find something that was spotted." "You all right, new kid?" asked one of the soldiers to his side. "Fine," Dalinar said. "Just worried. I mean, I don't even really know what we're looking for." "A spren that doesn't act like it should," the man said. "Keep your eyes open. Once Sjaanat touches a spren, it acts strange. Call attention to anything you see." Dalinar nodded, then under his breath repeated the words, hoping that Navani could hear him. He and the soldiers continued their sweep, the knight at their center speaking with . . . nobody? She sounded like she was having a conversation, but Dalinar couldn't see or hear anyone else with her. He turned his attention to the surroundings. He'd always wanted to see the center of the Purelake, but he'd never had a chance to do much besides visit the border. He'd been unable to find time for a detour in that direction during his last visit to Azir. The Azish had always acted surprised that he would want to go to such a place, as they claimed there was "nothing there." Dalinar wore some kind of tight shoes on his feet, perhaps to keep him from cutting them on anything hidden by the water. The footing was uneven in places, with holes and ridges he felt rather than saw. He found himself watching little fish dart this way and that, shadows in the water, and next to them a face. A face. Dalinar shouted, jumping back, pointing his spear downward. "That was a face! In the water!" "Riverspren?" the knight asked, stepping up beside him. "It looked like a shadow," Dalinar said. "Red eyes." "It's here, then," the knight said. "Sjaanat's spy. Caeb, run to the checkpoint. The rest of you, keep watching. It won't be able to go far without a carrier." She yanked something off her belt, a small pouch. "There!" Dalinar said, spotting a small red dot in the water. It flowed away from him, swimming like a fish. He charged after, running as he'd learned earlier. What good would it do to chase a spren, though? You couldn't catch them. Not with any method he knew. The others charged behind. Fish scattered away, frightened by Dalinar's splashing. "I'm chasing a spren," Dalinar said under his breath. "It's what we've been hunting. It looks a little like a facea shadowy one, with red eyes. It swims through the water like a fish. Wait! There's another one. Joining it. Larger, like a full figure, easily six feet. A swimming person, but like a shadow. It" "Storms!" the knight shouted suddenly. "It brought an escort!" The larger spren twisted, then dove downward in the water, vanishing into the rocky ground. Dalinar stopped, uncertain if he should keep chasing the smaller one or remain here. The others turned and started to run the other way. Uhoh . . . Dalinar scrambled back as the rocky lake bottom began to shake. He stumbled, splashing down into the water. It was so clear he could see the floor cracking under him, as if something large were pounding against it from beneath. "Come on!" one of the soldiers cried, grabbing him by the arm. Dalinar was pulled to his feet as the cracks below widened. The oncestill surface of the lake churned and thrashed. The ground jolted, almost tumbling Dalinar off his feet again. Ahead of him, several of the soldiers did fall. The knight stood firm, an enormous Shardblade forming in her hands. Dalinar glanced over his shoulder in time to see rock emerging from the water. A long arm! Slender, perhaps fifteen feet long, it burst from the water, then slammed back down as if to get a firm purchase on the lakebed. Another arm rose nearby, elbow toward the sky, then they both heaved as if attached to a body doing a pushup. A giant body ripped itself out of the rocky floor. It was like someone had been buried in sand and was now emerging. Water streamed from the creature's ridged and pocked back, which was overgrown with bits of shalebark and submarine fungus. The spren had somehow animated the stone itself. As it stood and twisted about, Dalinar could make out glowing red eyeslike molten rockset deep in an evil stone face. The body was skeletal, with thin bony limbs and spiky fingers that ended in rocky claws. The chest was a rib cage of stone. "Thunderclast!" soldiers yelled. "Hammers! Ready hammers!" The knight stood before the rising creature, which stood thirty feet tall, dripping water. A calm, white light began to rise from her. It reminded Dalinar of the light of spheres. Stormlight. She raised her Shardblade and charged, stepping through the water with uncanny ease, as if it had no purchase on her. Perhaps it was the strength of Shardplate. "They were created to watch," a voice said from beside him. Dalinar looked to the soldier who had helped him rise earlier, a longfaced Selay man with a balding scalp and a wide nose. Dalinar reached down to help the man to his feet. This wasn't how the man had spoken before, but Dalinar recognized the voice. It was the same one that came at the end of most of the visions. The Almighty. "The Knights Radiant," the Almighty said, standing up beside Dalinar, watching the knight attack the nightmare beast. "They were a solution, a way to offset the destruction of the Desolations. Ten orders of knights, founded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild." Dalinar repeated it, word for word, focused on catching every one and not on thinking about what they meant. The Almighty turned to him. "I was surprised when these orders arrived. I did not teach my Heralds this. It was the sprenwishing to imitate what I had given menwho made it possible. You will need to refound them. This is your task. Unite them. Create a fortress that can weather the storm. Vex Odium, convince him that he can lose, and appoint a champion. He will take that chance instead of risking defeat again, as he has suffered so often. This is the best advice I can give you." Dalinar finished repeating the words. Beyond him, the fight began in earnest, water splashing, rock grinding. Soldiers approached bearing hammers, and unexpectedly, these men now also glowed with Stormlight, though far more faintly. "You were surprised by the coming of the knights," Dalinar said to the Almighty. "And this force, this enemy, managed to kill you. You were never God. God knows everything. God cannot be killed. So who were you?" The Almighty did not answer. He couldn't. Dalinar had realized that these visions were some kind of predetermined experience, like a play. The people in them could react to Dalinar, like actors who could improvise to an extent. The Almighty himself never did this. "I will do what I can," Dalinar said. "I will refound them. I will prepare. You have told me many things, but there is one I have figured out on my own. If you could be killed, then the other like youyour enemyprobably can be as well." The darkness came upon Dalinar. The yelling and splashing faded. Had this vision occurred during a Desolation, or between? These visions never told him enough. As the darkness evaporated he found himself lying in a small stone chamber within his complex in the warcamps. Navani knelt beside him, clipboard held before her, pen moving as she scribbled. Storms, she was beautiful. Mature, lips painted red, hair wound about her head in a complex braid that sparkled with rubies. Bloodred dress. She looked at him, noting that he was blinking back awake, and smiled. "It was" he began. "Hush," she said, still writing. "That last part sounded important." She wrote for a moment, then finally removed pen from pad, the latter held through the cloth of her sleeve. "I think I got it all. It's hard when you change languages." "I changed languages?" he asked. "At the end. Before, you were speaking Selay. An ancient form of it, certainly, but we have records of that. I hope my translators can make sense of my transcription; my command of that language is rusty. You do need to speak more slowly when you do this, dearest." "That can be hard, in the moment," Dalinar said, rising. Compared to what he'd felt in the vision, the air here was cold. Rain pelted the room's closed shutters, though he knew from experience that an end to his vision meant that the storm had nearly spent itself. Feeling drained, he walked to a seat beside the wall and settled down. Only he and Navani were in the room; he preferred it that way. Renarin and Adolin waited out the storm nearby, in another room of Dalinar's quarters and under the watchful eyes of Captain Kaladin and his bridgeman bodyguards. Perhaps he should invite more scholars in to observe his visions; they could all write down his words, then consult to produce the most accurate version. But storms, he had enough trouble with one person watching him in such a state, raving and thrashing on the ground. He believed in the visions, even depended upon them, but that didn't mean it wasn't embarrassing. Navani sat down beside him, and wrapped her arms around him. "Was it bad?" "This one? No. Not bad. Some running, then some fighting. I didn't participate. The vision ended before I needed to help." "Then why that expression?" "I have to refound the Knights Radiant." "Refound the . . . But how? What does that even mean?" "I don't know. I don't know anything; I only have hints and shadowy threats. Something dangerous is coming, that much is certain. I have to stop it." She rested her head on his shoulder. He stared at the hearth, which crackled softly, giving the small room a warm glow. This was one of the few hearths that hadn't been converted to the new fabrial heating devices. He preferred the real fire, though he wouldn't say it to Navani. She worked so hard to bring new fabrials to them all. "Why you?" Navani asked. "Why do you have to do this?" "Why is one man born a king, and another a beggar?" Dalinar asked. "It is the way of the world." "It is that easy for you?" "Not easy," Dalinar said, "but there is no point in demanding answers." "Particularly if the Almighty is dead. . . ." Perhaps he should not have shared that fact with her. Speaking of just that one idea could brand him a heretic, drive his own ardents from him, give Sadeas a weapon against the Throne. If the Almighty was dead, what did Dalinar worship? What did he believe? "We should record your memories of the vision," Navani said with a sigh, pulling back from him. "While they are fresh." He nodded. It was important to have a description to match the transcriptions. He began to recount what he'd seen, speaking slowly enough that she could write it all down. He described the lake, the clothing of the men, the strange fortress in the distance. She claimed there were stories of large structures on the Purelake told by some who lived there. Scholars had considered them mythological. Dalinar stood up and paced as he moved on to the description of the unholy thing that had risen from the lake. "It left behind a hole in the lakebed," Dalinar explained. "Imagine if you were to outline a body on the floor, then watch that body rip itself free from the ground. "Imagine the tactical advantage such a thing would have. Spren move quickly and easily. One could slip in behind battle lines, then stand up and start attacking the support staff. That beast's stone body must have been difficult to break. Storms . . . Shardblades. Makes me wonder if these are the things the weapons were truly designed to fight." Navani smiled as she wrote. "What?" Dalinar asked, stopping in his pacing. "You are such a soldier." "Yes. And?" "And it's endearing," she said, finishing her writing. "What happened next?" "The Almighty spoke to me." He gave her the monologue as best he could remember while he paced in a slow, restful walk. I need to sleep more, he thought. He wasn't the youth he'd been twenty years ago, capable of staying up all night with Gavilar, listening with a cup of wine as his brother made plans, then charging to battle the next day full of vigor and hungering for a contest. Once he was done with his narrative, Navani rose, tucking her writing implements away. She'd take what he'd said and have her scholarswell, his scholars, which she'd appropriatedwork at matching his Alethi words up with the transcriptions she'd recorded. Though, of course, she'd first remove the lines where he mentioned sensitive issues, such as the Almighty's death. She'd also search for historical references to match his descriptions. Navani liked things neat and quantified. She'd prepared a timeline of all of his visions, trying to piece them into a single narrative. "You're still going to publish the proclamation this week?" she asked. Dalinar nodded. He'd released it to the highprinces a week ago, in private. He'd intended to release it the same day to the camps, but Navani had convinced him that this was the wiser course. News was seeping out, but this would let the highprinces prepare. "The proclamation will go to the public within a few days," he said. "Before the highprinces can put further pressure on Elhokar to retract it." Navani pursed her lips. "It must be done," Dalinar said. "You're supposed to unite them." "The highprinces are spoiled children," Dalinar said. "Changing them will require extreme measures." "If you break the kingdom apart, we'll never unify it." "We'll make certain that it doesn't break." Navani looked him up and down, then smiled. "I am fond of this more confident you, I must admit. Now, if I could just borrow a little of that confidence in regards to us . . ." "I am quite confident about us," he said, pulling her close. "Is that so? Because this traveling between the king's palace and your complex wastes a lot of my time each day. If I were to move my things here say, into your quartersthink how much more convenient everything would be." "No." "You're confident they won't let us marry, Dalinar. So what else are we to do? Is it the morality of the thing? You yourself said that the Almighty was dead." "Something is either right or it's wrong," Dalinar said, feeling stubborn. "The Almighty doesn't come into it." "God," Navani said flatly, "doesn't come into whether his commands are right or wrong." "Er. Yes." "Careful," Navani said. "You're sounding like Jasnah. Anyway, if God is dead " "God isn't dead. If the Almighty died, then he was never God, that's all." She sighed, still close to him. She went up on her toes and kissed himand not demurely, either. Navani considered demureness for the coy and frivolous. So, a passionate kiss, pressing against his mouth, pushing his head backward, hungering for more. When she pulled away, Dalinar found himself breathless. She smiled at him, then turned and picked up her thingshe hadn't noticed her dropping them during the kissand then walked to the door. "I am not a patient woman, you realize. I am as spoiled as those highprinces, accustomed to getting what I want." He snorted. Neither was true. She could be patient. When it suited her. What she meant was that it didn't suit her at the moment. She opened the door, and Captain Kaladin himself peered in, inspecting the room. The bridgeman certainly was earnest. "Watch her as she travels home for the day, soldier," Dalinar said to him. Kaladin saluted. Navani pushed by him and left without a goodbye, closing the door and leaving Dalinar alone again. Dalinar sighed deeply, then walked to the chair and settled down by the hearth to think. He started awake some time later, the fire having burned out. Storms. Was he falling asleep in the middle of the day, now? If only he didn't spend so much time at night tossing and turning, head full of worries and burdens that should never have been his. What had happened to the simple days? His hand on a sword, secure in the knowledge that Gavilar would handle the difficult parts? Dalinar stretched, rising. He needed to go over preparations for releasing the king's proclamation, and then see to the new guards He stopped. The wall of his room bore a series of stark white scratches forming glyphs. They hadn't been there before. Sixtytwo days, the glyphs read. Death follows. * * * A short time later, Dalinar stood, straightbacked, hands clasped behind him as he listened to Navani confer with Rushu, one of the Kholin scholars. Adolin stood nearby, inspecting a chunk of white rock that had been found on the floor. It had apparently been pried from the row of ornamental stones rimming the room's window, then used to write the glyphs. Straight back, head up, Dalinar told himself, even though you want to just slump in that chair. A leader did not slump. A leader was in control. Even when he least felt like he controlled anything. Especially then. "Ah," said Rushua young female ardent with long eyelashes and buttonlike lips. "Look at the sloppy lines! The improper symmetry. Whoever did this is not practiced with drawing glyphs. They almost spelled death wrongit looks more like 'broken.' And the meaning is vague. Death follows? Or is it 'follow death'? Or SixtyTwo Days of Death and Following? Glyphs are imprecise." "Just make the copy, Rushu," Navani said. "And don't speak of this to anyone." "Not even you?" Rushu asked, sounding distracted as she wrote. Navani sighed, walking over to Dalinar and Adolin. "She is good at what she does," Navani said softly, "but she's a little oblivious sometimes. Anyway, she knows handwriting better than anyone. It's one of her many areas of interest." Dalinar nodded, bottling his fears. "Why would anyone do this?" Adolin asked, dropping the rock. "Is it some kind of obscure threat?" "No," Dalinar said. Navani met Dalinar's eyes. "Rushu," she said. "Leave us for a moment." The woman didn't respond at first, but scuttled out at further prompting. As she opened the door, she revealed members of Bridge Four outside, led by Captain Kaladin, his expression dark. He'd escorted Navani away, then come back to find thisand then had immediately sent men to check on and retrieve Navani. He obviously considered this lapse his fault, thinking that someone had sneaked into Dalinar's room while he was sleeping. Dalinar waved the captain in. Kaladin hurried over, and hopefully didn't see how Adolin's jaw tightened as he regarded the man. Dalinar had been fighting the Parshendi Shardbearer when Kaladin and Adolin had clashed on the battlefield, but he'd heard talk of their runin. His son certainly did not like hearing that this darkeyed bridgeman had been put in charge of the Cobalt Guard. "Sir," Captain Kaladin said, stepping up. "I'm embarrassed. One week on the job, and I've failed you." "You did as commanded, Captain," Dalinar said. "I was commanded to keep you safe, sir," Kaladin said, anger bleeding into his voice. "I should have posted guards at individual doors inside your quarters, not just outside of the room complex." "We'll be more observant in the future, Captain," Dalinar said. "Your predecessor always posted the same guard as you did, and it was sufficient before." "Times were different before, sir," Kaladin said, scanning the room and narrowing his eyes. He focused on the window, too small to let someone slip in. "I still wish I knew how they got in. The guards heard nothing." Dalinar inspected the young soldier, scarred and dark of expression. Why, Dalinar thought, do I trust this man so much? He couldn't put his finger on it, but over the years, he'd learned to trust his instincts as a soldier and a general. Something within him urged him to trust Kaladin, and he accepted those instincts. "This is a small matter," Dalinar said. Kaladin looked at him sharply. "Don't worry yourself overly much about how the person got in to scribble on my wall," Dalinar said. "Just be more watchful in the future. Dismissed." He nodded to Kaladin, who retreated reluctantly, pulling the door closed. Adolin walked over. The mophaired youth was as tall as Dalinar was. That was hard to remember, sometimes. It didn't seem so long ago that Adolin had been an eager little boy with a wooden sword. "You said you awoke to this here," Navani said. "You said you didn't see anyone enter or hear anyone make the drawing." Dalinar nodded. "Then why," she said, "do I get the sudden and distinct impression that you know why it is here?" "I don't know for certain who made it, but I know what it means." "What, then?" Navani demanded. "It means we have very little time left," Dalinar said. "Send out the proclamation, then go to the highprinces and arrange a meeting. They'll want to speak with me." The Everstorm comes. . . . Sixtytwo days. Not enough time. It was, apparently, all he had. The sign on the wall proposed a greater danger, even, than its deadline. To foresee the future is of the Voidbringers. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jeseses 1174 "Toward victory and, at long last, vengeance." The crier carried a writ with the king's words on itbound between two clothcovered boardsthough she obviously had the words memorized. Not surprising. Kaladin alone had made her repeat the proclamation three times. "Again," he said, sitting on his stone beside Bridge Four's firepit. Many members of the crew had lowered their breakfast bowls, going silent. Nearby, Sigzil repeated the words to himself, memorizing them. The crier sighed. She was a plump, lighteyed young woman with strands of red hair mixed in her black, bespeaking Veden or Horneater heritage. There would be dozens of women like her moving through the warcamp to read, and sometimes explain, Dalinar's words. She opened the ledger again. In any other battalion, Kaladin thought idly, its leader would be of a high enough social class to outrank her. "Under the authority of the king," she said, "Dalinar Kholin, Highprince of War, hereby orders changes to the manner of collection and distribution of gemhearts on the Shattered Plains. Henceforth, each gemheart will be collected in turn by two highprinces working in tandem. The spoils become the property of the king, who will determinebased on the effectiveness of the parties involved and their alacrity to obeytheir share. "A prescribed rotation will detail which highprinces and armies are responsible for hunting gemhearts, and in what order. The pairings will not always be the same, and will be judged based on strategic compatibility. It is expected that by the Codes we all hold dear, the men and women of these armies will welcome this renewed focus on victory and, at long last, vengeance." The crier snapped the book closed, looking up at Kaladin and cocking a long black eyebrow he was pretty sure had been painted on with makeup. "Thank you," he said. She nodded to him, then moved off toward the next battalion square. Kaladin climbed to his feet. "Well, there's the storm we've been expecting." The men nodded. Conversation at Bridge Four had been subdued, following the strange breakin at Dalinar's quarters yesterday. Kaladin felt a fool. Dalinar, however, seemed to be ignoring the breakin entirely. He knew far more than he was telling Kaladin. How am I supposed to do my job if I don't have the information I need? Not two weeks on the job, and already the politics and machinations of the lighteyes were tripping him up. "The highprinces are going to hate this proclamation," Leyten said from beside the firepit, where he was working on Beld's breastplate straps, which had come from the quartermaster with the buckles twisted about. "They base pretty much everything on getting those gemhearts. We're going to have discontent aplenty on today's winds." "Ha!" Rock said, ladling up curry for Lopen, who had come back for seconds. "Discontent? Today, this will mean riots. Did you not hear that mention of the Codes? This thing, it is an insult against the others, whom we know do not follow their oaths." He was smiling, and seemed to consider the angereven riotingof the highprinces to be amusing. "Moash, Drehy, Mart, and Eth with me," Kaladin said. "We've got to go relieve Skar and his team. Teft, how goes your assignment?" "Slowly," Teft said. "Those lads in the other bridge crews . . . they have a long way to go. We need something more, Kal. Some way to inspire them." "I'll work on it," Kaladin said. "For now, we should try food. Rock, we've only got five officers at the moment, so you can have that last room on the outside for storage. Kholin gave us requisition rights from the camp quartermaster. Pack it full." "Full?" Rock asked, an enormous grin splitting his face. "How full?" "Very," Kaladin said. "We've been eating broth and stew with Soulcast grain for months. For the next month, Bridge Four eats like kings." "No shells, now," Mart said, pointing at Rock as he gathered his spear and did up his uniform jacket. "Just because you can fix anything you want, it doesn't mean we're going to eat something stupid." "Airsick lowlanders," Rock said. "Don't you want to be strong?" "I want to keep my teeth, thank you," Mart said. "Crazy Horneater." "I will fix two things," Rock said, hand to his chest, as if making a salute. "One for the brave and one for the silly. You may choose between these things." "You'll make feasts, Rock," Kaladin said. "I need you to train cooks for the other barracks. Even if Dalinar has extra cooks to spare now with fewer regular troops to feed, I want the bridgemen to be selfsufficient. Lopen, I'm assigning Dabbid and Shen to help you assist Rock from here on out. We need to turn those thousand men into soldiers. It starts the same way it did with all of you by filling their stomachs." "It will be done," Rock said, laughing, slapping Shen on the shoulder as the parshman stepped up for seconds. He'd only just started doing things like that, and seemed to hide in the back less than he once had. "I will not even put any dung in it!" The others chuckled. Putting dung in food was what had gotten Rock turned into a bridgeman in the first place. As Kaladin started out toward the king's palaceDalinar had an important meeting with the king todaySigzil joined him. "A moment of your time, sir," Sigzil said quietly. "If you wish." "You promised me that I could have a chance to measure your . . . particular abilities." "Promised?" Kaladin asked. "I don't remember a promise." "You grunted." "I . . . grunted?" "When I talked about taking some measurements. You seemed to think it was a good idea, and you told Skar we could help you figure out your powers." "I suppose I did." "We need to know exactly what you can do, sirthe extent of the abilities, the length of time the Stormlight remains in you. Do you agree that having a clear understanding of your limits would be valuable?" "Yes," Kaladin said reluctantly. "Excellent. Then . . ." "Give me a couple of days," Kaladin said. "Go prepare a place where we can't be seen. Then . . . yes, all right. I'll let you measure me." "Excellent," Sigzil said. "I've been devising some experiments." He stopped on the path, allowing Kaladin and the others to draw away from him. Kaladin rested his spear on his shoulder and relaxed his hand. He frequently found his grip on the weapon too strong, his knuckles white. It was like part of him still didn't believe he could carry it in public now, and feared it would be taken from him again. Syl floated down from her daily sprint around the camp on the morning winds. She alighted on his shoulder and sat, seeming lost in thought. Dalinar's warcamp was an organized place. Soldiers never lounged lazily here. They were always doing something. Working on their weapons, fetching food, carrying cargo, patrolling. Men patrolled a lot in this camp. Even with the reduced army numbers, Kaladin passed three patrols as his men marched toward the gates. That was three more than he'd ever seen in Sadeas's camp. He was reminded again of the emptiness. The dead didn't need to become Voidbringers to haunt this camp; the empty barracks did that. He passed one woman, seated on the ground beside one of those hollow barracks, staring up at the sky and clutching a bundle of masculine clothing. Two small children stood on the path beside her. Too silent. Children that small shouldn't be quiet. The barracks formed blocks in an enormous ring, and in the center of them was a more populated part of campthe bustling section that contained Dalinar's living complex, along with the quarters of the various highlords and generals. Dalinar's complex was a moundlike stone bunker with fluttering banners and scuttling clerks carrying armfuls of ledgers. Nearby, several officers had set up recruitment tents, and a long line of wouldbe soldiers had formed. Some were sellswords who had made their way to the Shattered Plains seeking work. Others were bakers or the like, who had heeded the cry for more soldiers following the disaster. "Why didn't you laugh?" Syl said, inspecting the line as Kaladin hiked around it, on toward the gates out of the warcamp. "I'm sorry," he replied. "Did you do something funny that I didn't see?" "I mean earlier," she said. "Rock and the others laughed. You didn't. When you laughed during the weeks things were hard, I knew that you were forcing yourself to. I thought, maybe, once things got better . . ." "I've got an entire battalion of bridgemen to keep track of now," Kaladin said, eyes forward. "And a highprince to keep alive. I'm in the middle of a camp full of widows. I guess I don't feel like laughing." "But things are better," she said. "For you and your men. Think of what you did, what you accomplished." A day spent on a plateau, slaughtering. A perfect melding of himself, his weapon, and the storms themselves. And he'd killed with it. Killed to protect a lighteyes. He's different, Kaladin thought. They always said that. "I guess I'm just waiting," Kaladin said. "For what?" "The thunder," Kaladin said softly. "It always follows after the lightning. Sometimes you have to wait, but eventually it comes." "I . . ." Syl zipped up in front of him, standing in the air, moving backward as he walked. She didn't flyshe didn't have wingsand didn't bob in the air. She just stood there, on nothing, and moved in unison with him. She seemed to take no notice of normal physical laws. She cocked her head at him. "I don't understand what you mean. Drat! I thought I was figuring this all out. Storms? Lightning?" "You know how, when you encouraged me to fight to save Dalinar, it still hurt you when I killed?" "Yes." "It's like that," Kaladin said softly. He looked to the side. He was again gripping his spear too tightly. Syl watched him, hands on hips, waiting for him to say more. "Something bad is going to happen," Kaladin said. "Things can't just continue to be good for me. That's not how life is. It might have to do with those glyphs on Dalinar's wall yesterday. They seemed like a countdown." She nodded. "Have you ever seen anything like that before?" "I remember . . . something," she whispered. "Something bad. Seeing what is to comeit isn't of Honor, Kaladin. It's something else. Something dangerous." Wonderful. When he said nothing more, Syl sighed and zipped into the air, becoming a ribbon of light. She followed him up there, moving between gusts of wind. She said that she's honorspren, Kaladin thought. So why does she still keep up the act of playing with winds? He'd have to ask her, assuming she'd answer him. Assuming she even knew the answer. * * * Torol Sadeas laced his fingers before himself, elbows on the fine stonework tabletop, as he stared at the Shardblade he'd thrust down through the center of the table. It reflected his face. Damnation. When had he gotten old? He imagined himself as a young man, in his twenties. Now he was fifty. Storming fifty. He set his jaw, looking at that Blade. Oathbringer. It was Dalinar's Shardbladecurved, like a back arching, with a hooklike tip on the end matched by a sequence of jutting serrations by the crossguard. Like waves in motion, peeking up from the ocean below. How often had he lusted for this weapon? Now it was his, but he found the possession hollow. Dalinar Kholindriven mad by grief, broken to the point that battle frightened himstill clung to life. Sadeas's old friend was like a favored axehound he'd been forced to put down, only to find it whimpering at the window, the poison having not quite done its work. Worse, he couldn't shake the feeling that Dalinar had gotten the better of him somehow. The door to his sitting room opened, and Ialai slipped in. With a slender neck and a large mouth, his wife had never been described as a beautyparticularly as the years stretched long. He didn't care. Ialai was the most dangerous woman he knew. That was more attractive than any simple pretty face. "You've destroyed my table, I see," she said, eyeing the Shardblade slammed down through the center. She flopped down onto the small couch beside him, draped one arm across his back, and put her feet up on the table. While with others, she was the perfect Alethi woman. In private, she preferred to lounge. "Dalinar is recruiting heavily," she said. "I've taken the opportunity to place a few more of my associates among the staff of his warcamp." "Soldiers?" "What do you take me for? That would be far too obvious; he will have new soldiers under careful watch. However, much of his support staff has holes as men join the call to take up spears and reinforce his army." Sadeas nodded, still staring at that Blade. His wife ran the most impressive network of spies in the warcamps. Most impressive indeed, since very, very few knew of it. She scratched at his back, sending shivers up the skin. "He released his proclamation," Ialai noted. "Yes. Reactions?" "As anticipated. The others hate it." Sadeas nodded. "Dalinar should be dead, but since he is not, at least we can depend upon him to hang himself in time." Sadeas narrowed his eyes. "By destroying him, I sought to prevent the collapse of the kingdom. Now I'm wondering if that collapse wouldn't be better for us all." "What?" "I'm not meant for this, love," Sadeas whispered. "This stupid game on the plateaus. It sated me at first, but I'm growing to loathe it. I want war, Ialai. Not hours of marching on the off chance that we'll find some little skirmish!" "Those little skirmishes bring us wealth." Which was why he'd suffered them so long. He rose. "I will need to meet with some of the others. Aladar. Ruthar. We need to fan the flames among the other highprinces, raise their indignation at what Dalinar attempts." "And our end goal?" "I will have it back, Ialai," he said, resting his fingers on Oathbringer's hilt. "The conquest." It was the only thing that made him feel alive any longer. That glorious, wonderful Thrill of being on the battlefield and striving, man against man. Of risking everything for the prize. Domination. Victory. It was the only time he felt like a youth again. It was a brutal truth. The best truths, however, were simple. He grabbed Oathbringer by the hilt and yanked it up out of the table. "Dalinar wants to play politician now, which is unsurprising. He has always secretly wanted to be his brother. Fortunately for us, Dalinar is no good at this sort of thing. His proclamation will alienate the others. He will push the highprinces, and they'll take up arms against him, fracturing the kingdom. And then, with blood at my feet and Dalinar's own sword in my hand, I will forge a new Alethkar from flame and tears." "What if, instead, he succeeds?" "That, my dear, is when your assassins will be of use." He dismissed the Shardblade; it turned to mist and vanished. "I will conquer this kingdom anew, and then Jah Keved will follow. After all, the purpose of this life is to train soldiers. In a way, I'm only doing what God himself wants." * * * The walk between the barracks and the king's palacewhich the king had started calling the Pinnacletook an hour or so, which gave Kaladin plenty of time to think. Unfortunately, on his way, he passed a group of Dalinar's surgeons in a field with servants, gathering knobweed sap for an antiseptic. Seeing them made Kaladin think not only of his own efforts gathering the sap, but of his father. Lirin. If he were here, Kaladin thought as he passed them, he'd ask why I wasn't out there, with the surgeons. He'd demand to know why, if Dalinar had taken me in, I hadn't requested to join his medical corps. In fact, Kaladin could probably have gotten Dalinar to employ all of Bridge Four as surgeons' assistants. Kaladin could have trained them in medicine almost as easily as he had the spear. Dalinar would have done it. An army could never have too many good surgeons. He hadn't even considered it. The choice for him had been simplereither become Dalinar's bodyguards or leave the warcamps. Kaladin had chosen to put his men in the path of the storm again. Why? Eventually, they reached the king's palace, which was built up the side of a large stone hill, with tunnels dug down into the rock. The king's own quarters sat at the very top. That meant lots of climbing for Kaladin and his men. They hiked up the switchbacks, Kaladin still lost in thought about his father and his duty. "That's a tad unfair, you know," Moash said as they reached the top. Kaladin looked to the others, realizing that they were puffing from the long climb. Kaladin, however, had drawn in Stormlight without noticing. He wasn't even winded. He smiled pointedly for Syl's benefit, and regarded the cavernous hallways of the Pinnacle. A few men stood guard at the entrance gates, wearing the blue and gold of the King's Guard, a separate and distinct unit from Dalinar's own guard. "Soldier," Kaladin said with a nod to one of them, a lighteyes of low rank. Militarily, Kaladin outranked a man like thisbut not socially. Again, he wasn't certain how all of this was supposed to work. The man looked him up and down. "I heard you held a bridge, practically by yourself, against hundreds of Parshendi. How'd you do that?" He did not address Kaladin with "sir," as would have been appropriate for any other captain. "You want to find out?" Moash snapped from behind. "We can show you. Personally." "Hush," Kaladin said, glaring at Moash. He turned back to the soldier. "I got lucky. That's it." He stared the man in the eyes. "I suppose that makes sense," the soldier said. Kaladin waited. "Sir," the soldier finally added. Kaladin waved his men forward, and they passed the lighteyed guards. The interior of the palace was lit by spheres grouped in lamps on the walls sapphires and diamonds blended to give a bluewhite cast. The spheres were a small but striking reminder of how things had changed. Nobody would have let bridgemen near such casual use of spheres. The Pinnacle was still unfamiliar to Kaladinso far, his time spent guarding Dalinar had mostly been in the warcamp. However, he'd made certain to look over maps of the place, so he knew the way to the top. "Why did you cut me off like that?" Moash demanded, catching up to Kaladin. "You were in the wrong," Kaladin said. "You're a soldier now, Moash. You're going to have to learn to act like one. And that means not provoking fights." "I'm not going to scrape and bow before lighteyes, Kal. Not anymore." "I don't expect you to scrape, but I do expect you to watch your tongue. Bridge Four is better than petty gibes and threats." Moash fell back, but Kaladin could tell he was still smoldering. "That's odd," Syl said, landing on Kaladin's shoulder again. "He looks so angry." "When I took over the bridgemen," Kaladin said softly, "they were caged animals who had been beaten into submission. I brought back their fight, but they were still caged. Now the doors are off those cages. It will take time for Moash and the others to adjust." They would. During the final weeks as bridgemen, they'd learned to act with the precision and discipline of soldiers. They stood at attention while their abusers marched across bridges, never uttering a word of derision. Their discipline itself had become their weapon. They'd learn to be real soldiers. No, they were real soldiers. Now they had to learn how to act without Sadeas's oppression to push against. Moash moved up beside him. "I'm sorry," he said softly. "You're right." Kaladin smiled, this time genuinely. "I'm not going to pretend I don't hate them," Moash said. "But I'll be civil. We have a duty. We'll do it well. Better than anyone expects. We're Bridge Four." "Good man," Kaladin said. Moash was going to be particularly tricky to deal with, as more and more, Kaladin found himself confiding in the man. Most of the others idolized Kaladin. Not Moash, who was as close to a real friend as Kaladin had known since being branded. The hallway grew surprisingly decorative as they approached the king's conference chamber. There was even a series of reliefs being carved on the walls the Heralds, embellished with gemstones on the rock to glow at appropriate locations. More and more like a city, Kaladin thought to himself. This might actually be a true palace soon. He met Skar and his team at the door into the king's conference chambers. "Report?" Kaladin asked softly. "Quiet morning," Skar said. "And I'm fine with that." "You're relieved for the day, then," Kaladin said. "I'll stay here for the meeting, then let Moash take the afternoon shift. I'll come back for the evening shift. You and your squad get some sleep; you'll be back on duty tonight, stretching to tomorrow morning." "Got it, sir," Skar said, saluting. He collected his men and moved off. The chamber beyond the doors was decorated with a thick rug and large unshuttered windows on the leeward side. Kaladin had never been in this room, and the palace mapsfor the protection of the kingonly included the basic hallways and routes through the servants' quarters. This room had one other door, probably out onto the balcony, but no exits other than the one Kaladin stepped through. Two other guards in blue and gold stood on either side of the door. The king himself paced back and forth beside the room's desk. His nose was larger than the paintings of him showed. Dalinar spoke with Highlady Navani, an elegant woman with grey in her hair. The scandalous relationship between the king's uncle and mother would have been the talk of the warcamp, if Sadeas's betrayal hadn't overshadowed it. "Moash," Kaladin said, pointing. "See where that door goes. Mart and Eth, stand watch just outside in the hall. Nobody other than a highprince comes in until you've checked with us in here." Moash gave the king a salute instead of a bow, and checked on the door. It indeed led to the balcony that Kaladin had spotted from below. It ran all around this upmost room. Dalinar studied Kaladin and Moash as they worked. Kaladin saluted, and met the man's eyes. He wasn't going to fail again, as he'd done the day before. "I don't recognize these guards, Uncle," the king said with annoyance. "They're new," Dalinar said. "There is no other way onto that balcony, soldier. It's a hundred feet in the air." "Good to know," Kaladin said. "Drehy, join Moash out there on the balcony, close the door, and keep watch." Drehy nodded, jumping into motion. "I just said there's no way to reach that balcony from the outside," Dalinar said. "Then that's the way I'd try to get in," Kaladin said, "if I wanted to, sir." Dalinar smiled in amusement. The king, however, was nodding. "Good . . . good." "Are there any other ways into this room, Your Majesty?" Kaladin asked. "Secret entrances, passages?" "If there were," the king said, "I wouldn't want people knowing about them." "My men can't keep this room safe if we don't know what to guard. If there are passages nobody is supposed to know about, those are immediately suspect. If you share them with me, I'll use only my officers in guarding them." The king stared at Kaladin for a moment, then turned to Dalinar. "I like this one. Why haven't you put him in charge of your guard before?" "I haven't had the opportunity," Dalinar said, studying Kaladin with eyes that had a depth behind them. A weight. He stepped over and rested a hand on Kaladin's shoulder, pulling him aside. "Wait," the king said from behind, "is that a captain's insignia? On a darkeyes? When did that start happening?" Dalinar didn't answer, instead walking Kaladin to the side of the room. "The king," he said softly, "is very worried about assassins. You should know this." "A healthy paranoia makes the job easier for his bodyguards, sir," Kaladin said. "I didn't say it was healthy," Dalinar said. "You call me 'sir.' The common address is 'Brightlord.'" "I will use that term if you command, sir," Kaladin said, meeting the man's eyes. "But 'sir' is an appropriate address, even for a lighteyes, if he's your direct superior." "I'm a highprince." "Speaking frankly," Kaladin saidhe wouldn't ask for permission. This man had put him in the role, so Kaladin would assume it came with certain privileges, unless told otherwise. "Every man I've ever called 'Brightlord' has betrayed me. A few men I've called 'sir' still have my trust to this day. I use one more reverently than the other. Sir." "You're an odd one, son." "The normal ones are dead in the chasms, sir," Kaladin said softly. "Sadeas saw to that." "Well, have your men on the balcony guard from farther to the side, where they can't hear through the window." "I'll wait with the men in the hall, then," Kaladin said, noticing that the two men of the King's Guard had already moved through the doors. "I didn't order that," Dalinar said. "Guard the doors, but on the inside. I want you to hear what we're planning. Just don't repeat it outside this room." "Yes, sir." "Four more people are coming to the meeting," Dalinar said. "My sons, General Khal, and Brightness Teshav, Khal's wife. They may enter. Anyone else should be kept back until the meeting is over." Dalinar went back to a conversation with the king's mother. Kaladin got Moash and Drehy positioned, then explained the door protocol to Mart and Eth. He'd have to do some training later. Lighteyes never truly meant "Don't let anyone else in" when they said "Don't let anyone else in." What they meant was "If you let anyone else in, I'd better agree that it was important enough, or you're in trouble." Then, Kaladin took his post inside the closed door, standing against a wall with carved paneling made of a rare type of wood he didn't recognize. It's probably worth more than I've earned in my entire lifetime, he thought idly. One wooden panel. The highprince's sons arrived, Adolin and Renarin Kholin. Kaladin had seen the former on the battlefield, though he looked different without his Shardplate. Less imposing. More like a spoiled rich boy. Oh, he wore a uniform like everyone else, but the buttons were engraved, and the boots . . . those were expensive hogshide ones without a scuff on them. Brand new, likely bought at ridiculous expense. He did save that woman in the market, though, Kaladin thought, remembering the encounter from weeks ago. Don't forget about that. Kaladin wasn't sure what to make of Renarin. The youthhe might have been older than Kaladin, but sure didn't look itwore spectacles and walked after his brother like a shadow. Those slender limbs and delicate fingers had never known battle or real work. Syl bobbed around the room, poking into nooks, crannies, and vases. She stopped at a paperweight on the women's writing desk beside the king's chair, poking at the block of crystal with a strange kind of crabthing trapped inside. Were those wings? "Shouldn't that one wait outside?" Adolin asked, nodding toward Kaladin. "What we're doing is going to put me in direct danger," Dalinar said, hands clasped behind his back. "I want him to know the details. That might be important to his job." Dalinar didn't look toward Adolin or Kaladin. Adolin walked up, taking Dalinar by the arm and speaking in a hushed tone that was not so soft that Kaladin couldn't hear. "We barely know him." "We have to trust some people, Adolin," his father said in a normal voice. "If there's one person in this army I can guarantee isn't working for Sadeas, it's that soldier." He turned and glanced at Kaladin, once again studying him with those unfathomable eyes. He didn't see me with the Stormlight, Kaladin told himself forcefully. He was practically unconscious. He doesn't know. Does he? Adolin threw up his hands but walked to the other side of the room, muttering something to his brother. Kaladin remained in position, standing comfortably at parade rest. Yes, definitely spoiled. The general who arrived soon after was a limber, bald man with a straight back and pale yellow eyes. His wife, Teshav, had a pinched face and hair streaked blond. She took up position by the writing desk, which Navani had made no move to occupy. "Reports," Dalinar said from the window as the door clicked shut behind the two newcomers. "I suspect you know what you'll hear, Brightlord," said Teshav. "They're irate. They sincerely hoped you would reconsider the commandand sending it out to the public has provoked them. Highprince Hatham was the only one to make a public announcement. He plans toand I quote'see that the king is dissuaded from this reckless and illadvised course.'" The king sighed, settling into his seat. Renarin sat down immediately, as did the general. Adolin found his seat more reluctantly. Dalinar remained standing, looking out the window. "Uncle?" the king asked. "Did you hear that reaction? It's a good thing you didn't go so far as you had considered: to proclaim that they must follow the Codes or face seizure of assets. We'd be in the middle of a rebellion." "That will come," Dalinar said. "I still wonder if I should have announced it all at once. When you've got an arrow stuck in you, it's sometimes best to just yank it out in one pull." Actually, when you had an arrow in you, the best thing to do was leave it there until you could find a surgeon. Often it would plug the blood flow and keep you alive. It was probably best not to speak up and undermine the highprince's metaphor, however. "Storms, what a ghastly image," the king said, wiping his face with a handkerchief. "Do you have to say such things, Uncle? I already fear we'll be dead before the week is out." "Your father and I survived worse than this," Dalinar said. "You had allies, then! Three highprinces for you, only six against, and you never fought them all at the same time." "If the highprinces unite against us," General Khal said, "we will not be able to stand firm. We'll have no choice but to rescind this proclamation, which will weaken the Throne considerably." The king leaned back, hand to his forehead. "Jezerezeh, this is going to be a disaster. . . ." Kaladin raised an eyebrow. "You disagree?" Syl asked, moving over toward him as a cluster of fluttering leaves. It was disconcerting to hear her voice coming from such shapes. The others in the room, of course, couldn't see or hear her. "No," Kaladin whispered. "This proclamation sounds like a real tempest. I just expected the king to be less . . . well, whiny." "We need to secure allies," Adolin said. "Form a coalition. Sadeas will gather one, and so we counter him with our own." "Dividing the kingdom into two?" Teshav said, shaking her head. "I don't see how a civil war would serve the Throne. Particularly one we're unlikely to win." "This could be the end of Alethkar as a kingdom," the general agreed. "Alethkar ended as a kingdom centuries ago," Dalinar said softly, staring out that window. "This thing we have created is not Alethkar. Alethkar was justice. We are children wearing our father's cloak." "But Uncle," the king said, "at least the kingdom is something. More than it has been in centuries! If we fail here, and fracture to ten warring princedoms, it will negate everything my father worked for!" "This isn't what your father worked for, son," Dalinar said. "This game on the Shattered Plains, this nauseating political farce. This isn't what Gavilar envisioned. The Everstorm comes. . . ." "What?" the king asked. Dalinar turned from the window finally, walking to the others, and rested his hand on Navani's shoulder. "We're going to find a way to do this, or we're going to destroy the kingdom in the process. I won't suffer this charade any longer." Kaladin, arms folded, tapped one finger against his elbow. "Dalinar acts like he's the king," he mouthed, whispering so softly only Syl could hear. "And everyone else does as well." Troubling. It was like what Amaram had done. Seizing the power he saw before him, even if it wasn't his. Navani looked up at Dalinar, raising her hand to rest on his. She was in on whatever he was planning, judging by that expression. The king wasn't. He sighed lightly. "You've obviously got a plan, Uncle. Well? Out with it. This drama is tiring." "What I really want to do," Dalinar said frankly, "is beat the lot of them senseless. That's what I'd do to new recruits who weren't willing to obey orders." "I think you'll have a hard time spanking obedience into the highprinces, Uncle," the king said dryly. For some reason, he absently rubbed at his chest. "You need to disarm them," Kaladin found himself saying. All eyes in the room turned toward him. Brightness Teshav gave him a frown, as if speaking were not Kaladin's right. It probably wasn't. Dalinar, however, nodded toward him. "Soldier? You have a suggestion?" "Your pardon, sir," Kaladin said. "And your pardon, Your Majesty. But if a squad is giving you trouble, the first thing you do is separate its members. Split them up, stick them in better squads. I don't think you can do that here." "I don't know how we'd break apart the highprinces," Dalinar said. "I doubt I could stop them from associating with one another. Perhaps if this war were won, I could assign different highprinces different duties, send them off, then work on them individually. But for the time being, we are trapped here." "Well, the second thing you do to troublemakers," Kaladin said, "is you disarm them. They're easier to control if you make them turn in their spears. It's embarrassing, makes them feel like recruits again. So . . . can you take their troops away from them, maybe?" "We can't, I'm afraid," Dalinar said. "The soldiers swore allegiance to their lighteyes, not to the Crown specificallyit's only the highprinces who have sworn to the Crown. However, you are thinking along the right lines." He squeezed Navani's shoulder. "For the last two weeks," he said, "I've been trying to decide how to approach this problem. My gut tells me that I need to treat the highprincesthe entire lighteyed population of Alethkarlike new recruits, in need of discipline." "He came to me, and we talked," Navani said. "We can't actually bust the highprinces down to a manageable rank, as much as Dalinar would like to do just that. Instead, we need to lead them to believe that we're going to take it all from them, if they don't shape up." "This proclamation will make them mad," Dalinar said. "I want them mad. I want them to think about the war, their place here, and I want to remind them of Gavilar's assassination. If I can push them to act more like soldiers, even if it starts with them taking up arms against me, then I might be able to persuade them. I can reason with soldiers. Regardless, a big part of this will involve the threat that I'm going to take away their authority and power if they don't use it correctly. And that begins, as Captain Kaladin suggested, with disarming them." "Disarm the highprinces?" the king asked. "What foolishness is this?" "It's not foolishness," Dalinar said, smiling. "We can't take their armies from them, but we can do something else. Adolin, I intend to take the lock off your scabbard." Adolin frowned, considering that for a moment. Then a wide grin split his face. "You mean, letting me duel again? For real?" "Yes," Dalinar said. He turned to the king. "For the longest time, I've forbidden him from important bouts, as the Codes prohibit duels of honor between officers at war. More and more, however, I've come to realize that the others don't see themselves as being at war. They're playing a game. It's time to allow Adolin to duel the camp's other Shardbearers in official bouts." "So he can humiliate them?" the king asked. "It wouldn't be about humiliation; it would be about depriving them of their Shards." Dalinar stepped into the middle of the group of chairs. "The highprinces would have a hard time fighting against us if we controlled all of the Shardblades and Shardplate in the army. Adolin, I want you to challenge the Shardbearers of other highprinces in duels of honor, the prizes being the Shards themselves." "They won't agree to it," General Khal said. "They'll refuse the bouts." "We'll have to make sure they agree," Dalinar said. "Find a way to force them, or shame them, into the fights. I've considered that this would probably be easier if we could ever track down where Wit ran off to." "What happens if the lad loses?" General Khal asked. "This plan seems too unpredictable." "We'll see," Dalinar said. "This is only one part of what we will do, the smaller partbut also the most visible part. Adolin, everyone tells me how good you are at dueling, and you have pestered me incessantly to relax my prohibition. There are thirty Shardbearers in the army, not counting our own. Can you defeat that many men?" "Can I?" Adolin said, grinning. "I'll do it without breaking a sweat, so long as I can start with Sadeas himself." So he's spoiled and cocky, Kaladin thought. "No," Dalinar said. "Sadeas won't accept a personal challenge, though eventually bringing him down is our goal. We start with some of the lesser Shardbearers and work up." The others in the room seemed troubled. That included Brightness Navani, who drew her lips to a line and glanced at Adolin. She might be in on Dalinar's plan, but she didn't love the idea of her nephew dueling. She didn't say so. "As Dalinar indicated," Navani said, "this won't be our entire plan. Hopefully, Adolin's duels won't need to go far. They are meant mostly to inspire worry and fear, to apply pressure to some factions who are working against us. The greater part of what we must do will entail a complex and determined political effort to connect with those who can be swayed to our side." "Navani and I will work to persuade the highprinces of the advantages of a truly unified Alethkar," Dalinar said, nodding. "Though the Stormfather knows, I'm less certain of my political acumen than Adolin is of his dueling. It is what must be. If Adolin is to be the stick, I must be the feather." "There will be assassins, Uncle," Elhokar said, sounding tired. "I don't think Khal is right; I don't think Alethkar will shatter immediately. The highprinces have come to like the idea of being one kingdom. But they also like their sport, their fun, their gemhearts. So they will send assassins. Quietly, at first, and probably not directly at you or me. Our families. Sadeas and the others will try to hurt us, make us back down. Are you willing to risk your sons on this? How about my mother?" "Yes, you are right," Dalinar said. "I hadn't . . . but yes. That is how they think." He sounded regretful to Kaladin. "And you're still willing to go through with this plan?" the king asked. "I have no choice," Dalinar said, turning away, walking back toward the window. Looking out westward, in toward the continent. "Then at least tell me this," Elhokar said. "What is your endgame, Uncle? What is it you want out of all of this? In a year, if we survive this fiasco, what do you want us to be?" Dalinar put his hands on the thick stone windowsill. He stared out, as if at something he could see and the rest of them could not. "I'll have us be what we were before, son. A kingdom that can stand through storms, a kingdom that is a light and not a darkness. I will have a truly unified Alethkar, with highprinces who are loyal and just. I'll have more than that." He tapped the windowsill. "I'm going to refound the Knights Radiant." Kaladin nearly dropped his spear in shock. Fortunately, nobody was watching himthey were leaping to their feet, staring at Dalinar. "The Radiants?" Brightness Teshav demanded. "Are you mad? You're going to try to rebuild a sect of traitors who gave us over to the Voidbringers?" "The rest of this sounds good, Father," Adolin said, stepping forward. "I know you think about the Radiants a lot, but you see them . . . differently than everyone else. It won't go well if you announce that you want to emulate them." The king just groaned, burying his face in his hands. "People are wrong about them," Dalinar said. "And even if they are not, the original Radiantsthe ones instituted by the Heraldsare something even the Vorin church admits were once moral and just. We'll need to remind people that the Knights Radiant, as an order, stood for something grand. If they hadn't, then they wouldn't have been able to 'fall' as the stories claim they did." "But why?" Elhokar asked. "What is the point?" "It is what I must do." Dalinar hesitated. "I'm not completely certain why, yet. Only that I've been instructed to do it. As a protection, and a preparation, for what is coming. A storm of some sort. Perhaps it is as simple as the other highprinces turning against us. I doubt that, but perhaps." "Father," Adolin said, hand on Dalinar's arm. "This is all well and good, and maybe you can change people's perception of the Radiants, but . . . Ishar's soul, Father! They could do things we cannot. Simply naming someone a Radiant won't give them fanciful powers, like in the stories." "The Radiants were about more than what they could do," Dalinar said. "They were about an ideal. The kind of ideal we're lacking, these days. We may not be able to reach for the ancient Surgebindingsthe powers they hadbut we can seek to emulate the Radiants in other ways. I am set on this. Do not try to dissuade me." The others did not seem convinced. Kaladin narrowed his eyes. So did Dalinar know about Kaladin's powers, or didn't he? The meeting moved on to more mundane topics, such as how to maneuver Shardbearers into facing Adolin and how to step up patrols of the surrounding area. Dalinar considered making the warcamps safe to be a prerequisite for what he was attempting. When the meeting finally ended, most people inside departing to carry out orders, Kaladin was still considering what Dalinar had said about the Radiants. The man hadn't realized it, but he'd been very accurate. The Knights Radiant did have idealsand they'd called them that very thing. The Five Ideals, the Immortal Words. Life before death, Kaladin thought, playing with a sphere he'd pulled from his pocket, strength before weakness, journey before destination. Those Words made up the First Ideal in its entirety. He had only an inkling of what it meant, but his ignorance hadn't stopped him from figuring out the Second Ideal of the Windrunners, the oath to protect those who could not protect themselves. Syl wouldn't tell him the other three. She said he would know them when he needed to. Or he wouldn't, and would not progress. Did he want to progress? To become what? A member of the Knights Radiant? Kaladin hadn't asked for someone else's ideals to rule his life. He'd just wanted to survive. Now, somehow, he was headed straight down a path that no man had trod in centuries. Potentially becoming something that people across Roshar would hate or revere. So much attention . . . "Soldier?" Dalinar asked, stopping by the door. "Sir." Kaladin stood up straight again and saluted. It felt good to do that, to stand at attention, to find a place. He wasn't certain if it was the good feeling of remembering a life he'd once loved, or if it was the pathetic feeling of an axehound finding its leash again. "My nephew was right," Dalinar said, watching the king retreat down the hallway. "The others might try to hurt my family. It's how they think. I'm going to need guard details on Navani and my sons at all times. Your best men." "I've got about two dozen of those, sir," Kaladin said. "That's not enough for full guard details running all day protecting all four of you. I should have more men trained before too long, but putting a spear in the hands of a bridgeman does not make him a soldier, let alone a good bodyguard." Dalinar nodded, looking troubled. He rubbed his chin. "Sir?" "Your force isn't the only one stretched thin in this warcamp, soldier," Dalinar said. "I lost a lot of men to Sadeas's betrayal. Very good men. Now I have a deadline. Just over sixty days . . ." Kaladin felt a chill. The highprince was taking the number found scrawled on his wall very seriously. "Captain," Dalinar said softly, "I need every ablebodied man I can get. I need to be training them, rebuilding my army, preparing for the storm. I need them assaulting plateaus, clashing with the Parshendi, to get battle experience." What did this have to do with him? "You promised that my men wouldn't be required to fight on plateau runs." "I'll keep that promise," Dalinar said. "But there are two hundred and fifty soldiers in the King's Guard. They include some of my last remaining battleready officers, and I will need to put them in charge of new recruits." "I'm not just going to have to watch over your family, am I?" Kaladin asked, feeling a new weight settling in his shoulders. "You're implying you want to turn over guarding the king to me as well." "Yes," Dalinar said. "Slowly, but yes. I need those soldiers. Beyond that, maintaining two separate guard forces seems like a mistake to me. I feel that your men, considering your background, are the least likely to include spies for my enemies. You should know that a while back, there may have been an attempt on the king's life. I still haven't figured out who was behind it, but I worry that some of his guards may have been involved." Kaladin took a deep breath. "What happened?" "Elhokar and I hunted a chasmfiend," Dalinar said. "During that hunt, at a time of stress, the king's Plate came close to failing. We found that many of the gemstones powering it had likely been replaced with ones that were flawed, making them crack under stress." "I don't know much of Plate, sir," Kaladin said. "Could they have just broken on their own, without sabotage?" "Possible, but unlikely. I want your men to take shifts guarding the palace and the king, alternating with some of the King's Guard, to get you familiar with him and the palace. It might also help your men learn from the more experienced guards. At the same time, I'm going to start siphoning off the officers from his guard to train soldiers in my army. "Over the next few weeks, we'll merge your group and the King's Guard into one. You'll be in charge. Once you've trained bridgemen from those other crews well enough, we'll replace soldiers in the guard with your men, and move the soldiers to my army." He looked Kaladin in the eyes. "Can you do this, soldier?" "Yes, sir," Kaladin said, though part of him was panicking. "I can." "Good." "Sir, a suggestion. You've said you're going to expand patrols outside the warcamps, trying to police the hills around the Shattered Plains?" "Yes. The number of bandits out there is embarrassing. This is Alethi land now. It needs to follow Alethi laws." "I have a thousand men I need to train," Kaladin said. "If I could patrol them out there, it might help them feel like soldiers. I could use a large enough force that it sends a message to the bandits, maybe making them withdrawbut my men won't need to see much combat." "Good. General Khal had been in command of patrol duty, but he's now my most senior commander, and will be needed for other things. Train your men. Our goal will eventually be to have your thousand doing real roadway patrols between here, Alethkar, and the ports to the south and east. I'll want scouting teams, watching for signs of bandit camps and searching out caravans that have been attacked. I need numbers on how much activity is out there, and just how dangerous it is." "I'll see to it personally, sir." Storms. How was he going to do all of this? "Good," Dalinar said. Dalinar walked from the chamber, clasping his hands behind him, as if lost in thought. Moash, Eth, and Mart fell in after him, as ordered by Kaladin. He'd have two men with Dalinar at all times, three if he could manage it. He'd once hoped to expand that to four or five, but storms, with so many to watch over now, that was going to be impossible. Who is this man? Kaladin thought, watching Dalinar's retreating form. He ran a good camp. You could judge a manand Kaladin didby the men who followed him. But a tyrant could have a good camp with disciplined soldiers. This man, Dalinar Kholin, had helped unite Alethkarand had done so by wading through blood. Now . . . now he spoke like a king, even when the king himself was in the room. He wants to rebuild the Knights Radiant, Kaladin thought. That wasn't something Dalinar Kholin could accomplish through simple force of will. Unless he had help. We had never considered that there might be Parshendi spies hiding among our slaves. This is something else I should have seen. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesan 1174 Shallan sat again on her box on the ship's deck, though she now wore a hat on her head, a coat over her dress, and a glove on her freehandher safehand was, of course, pinned inside its sleeve. The chill out here on the open ocean was something unreal. The captain said that far to the south, the ocean itself actually froze. That sounded incredible; she'd like to see it. She'd occasionally seen snow and ice in Jah Keved, during the odd winter. But an entire ocean of it? Amazing. She wrote with gloved fingers as she observed the spren she'd named Pattern. At the moment, he had lifted himself up off the surface of the deck, forming a ball of swirling blacknessinfinite lines that twisted in ways she could never have captured on the flat page. Instead, she wrote descriptions supplemented with sketches. "Food . . ." Pattern said. The sound had a buzzing quality and he vibrated when he spoke. "Yes," Shallan said. "We eat it." She selected a small limafruit from the bowl beside her and placed it in her mouth, then chewed and swallowed. "Eat," Pattern said. "You . . . make it . . . into you." "Yes! Exactly." He dropped down, the darkness vanishing as he entered the wooden deck of the ship. Once again, he became part of the materialmaking the wood ripple as if it were water. He slid across the floor, then moved up the box beside her to the bowl of small green fruits. Here, he moved across them, each fruit's rind puckering and rising with the shape of his pattern. "Terrible!" he said, the sound vibrating up from the bowl. "Terrible?" "Destruction!" "What? No, it's how we survive. Everything needs to eat." "Terrible destruction to eat!" He sounded aghast. He retreated from the bowl to the deck. Pattern connects increasingly complex thoughts, Shallan wrote. Abstractions come easily to him. Early, he asked me the questions "Why? Why you? Why be?" I interpreted this as asking me my purpose. When I replied, "To find truth," he easily seemed to grasp my meaning. And yet, some simple realitiessuch as why people would need to eatcompletely escape him. It She stopped writing as the paper puckered and rose, Pattern appearing on the sheet itself, his tiny ridges lifting the letters she had just penned. "Why this?" he asked. "To remember." "Remember," he said, trying the word. "It means . . ." Stormfather. How did she explain memory? "It means to be able to know what you did in the past. In other moments, ones that happened days ago." "Remember," he said. "I . . . cannot . . . remember . . ." "What is the first thing you do remember?" Shallan asked. "Where were you first?" "First," Pattern said. "With you." "On the ship?" Shallan said, writing. "No. Green. Food. Food not eaten." "Plants?" Shallan asked. "Yes. Many plants." He vibrated, and she thought she could hear in that vibration the blowing of wind through branches. Shallan breathed in. She could almost see it. The deck in front of her changing to a dirt path, her box becoming a stone bench. Faintly. Not really there, but almost. Her father's gardens. Pattern on the ground, drawn in the dust . . . "Remember," Pattern said, voice like a whisper. No, Shallan thought, horrified. NO! The image vanished. It hadn't really been there in the first place, had it? She raised her safehand to her breast, breathing in and out in sharp gasps. No. "Hey, young miss!" Yalb said from behind. "Tell the new kid here what happened in Kharbranth!" Shallan turned, heart still racing, to see Yalb walking over with the "new kid," a sixfoottall hulk of a man who was at least five years Yalb's senior. They'd picked him up at Amydlatn, the last port. Tozbek wanted to be sure they wouldn't be undermanned during the last leg to New Natanan. Yalb squatted down beside her stool. In the face of the chill, he'd acquiesced to wearing a shirt with ragged sleeves and a kind of headband that wrapped over his ears. "Brightness?" Yalb asked. "You all right? You look like you swallowed a turtle. And not just the head, neither." "I'm well," Shallan said. "What . . . what was it you wanted of me, again?" "In Kharbranth," Yalb said, thumbing over his shoulder. "Did we or did we not meet the king?" "We?" Shallan asked. "I met him." "And I was your retinue." "You were waiting outside." "Doesn't matter none," Yalb said. "I was your footman for that meeting, eh?" Footman? He'd led her up to the palace as a favor. "I . . . guess," she said. "You did have a nice bow, as I recall." "See," Yalb said, standing and confronting the much larger man. "I mentioned the bow, didn't I?" The "new kid" rumbled his agreement. "So get to washing those dishes," Yalb said. He got a scowl in response. "Now, don't give me that," Yalb said. "I told you, galley duty is something the captain watches closely. If you want to fit in around here, you do it well, and do some extra. It will put you ahead with the captain and the rest of the men. I'm giving you quite the opportunity here, and I'll have you appreciate it." That seemed to placate the larger man, who turned around and went tromping toward the lower decks. "Passions!" Yalb said. "That fellow is as dun as two spheres made of mud. I worry about him. Somebody's going to take advantage of him, Brightness." "Yalb, have you been boasting again?" Shallan said. "'Tain't boasting if some of it's true." "Actually, that's exactly what boasting entails." "Hey," Yalb said, turning toward her. "What were you doing before? You know, with the colors?" "Colors?" Shallan said, suddenly cold. "Yeah, the deck turned green, eh?" Yalb said. "I swear I saw it. Has to do with that strange spren, does it?" "I . . . I'm trying to determine exactly what kind of spren it is," Shallan said, keeping her voice even. "It's a scholarly matter." "I thought so," Yalb said, though she'd given him nothing in the way of an answer. He raised an affable hand to her, then jogged off. She worried about letting them see Pattern. She'd tried staying in her cabin to keep him a secret from the men, but being cooped up had been too difficult for her, and he didn't respond to her suggestions that he stay out of their sight. So, during the last four days, she'd been forced to let them see what she was doing as she studied him. They were understandably discomforted by him, but didn't say much. Today, they were getting the ship ready to sail all night. Thoughts of the open sea at night unsettled her, but that was the cost of sailing this far from civilization. Two days back, they'd even been forced to weather a storm in a cove along the coast. Jasnah and Shallan had gone ashore to stay in a fortress maintained for the purposepaying a steep cost to get inwhile the sailors had stayed on board. That cove, though not a true port, had at least had a stormwall to help shelter the ship. Next highstorm, they wouldn't even have that. They'd find a cove and try to ride out the winds, though Tozbek said he'd send Shallan and Jasnah ashore to seek shelter in a cavern. She turned back to Pattern, who had shifted into his hovering form. He looked something like the pattern of splintered light thrown on the wall by a crystal chandelierexcept he was made of something black instead of light, and he was threedimensional. So . . . Maybe not much like that at all. "Lies," Pattern said. "Lies from the Yalb." "Yes," Shallan said with a sigh. "Yalb is far too skilled at persuasion for his own good, sometimes." Pattern hummed softly. He seemed pleased. "You like lies?" Shallan asked. "Good lies," Pattern said. "That lie. Good lie." "What makes a lie good?" Shallan asked, taking careful notes, recording Pattern's exact words. "True lies." "Pattern, those two are opposites." "Hmmmm . . . Light makes shadow. Truth makes lies. Hmmmm." Liespren, Jasnah called them, Shallan wrote. A moniker they don't like, apparently. When I Soulcast for the first time, a voice demanded a truth from me. I still don't know what that means, and Jasnah has not been forthcoming. She doesn't seem to know what to make of my experience either. I do not think that voice belonged to Pattern, but I cannot say, as he seems to have forgotten much about himself. She returned to making a few sketches of Pattern both in his floating and flattened forms. Drawing let her mind relax. By the time she was done, there were several halfremembered passages from her research that she wanted to quote in her notes. She made her way down the steps belowdecks, Pattern following. He drew looks from the sailors. Sailors were a superstitious lot, and some took him as a bad sign. In her quarters, Pattern moved up the wall beside her, watching without eyes as she searched for a passage she remembered, which mentioned spren that spoke. Not just windspren and riverspren, which would mimic people and make playful comments. Those were a step up from ordinary spren, but there was yet another level of spren, one rarely seen. Spren like Pattern, who had real conversations with people. The Nightwatcher is obviously one of these, Alai wrote, Shallan copying the passage. The records of conversations with herand she is definitely female, despite what rural Alethi folktales would have one believeare numerous and credible. Shubalai herself, intent on providing a firsthand scholarly report, visited the Nightwatcher and recorded her story word for word. . . . Shallan went to another reference, and before long got completely lost in her studies. A few hours later, she closed a book and set it on the table beside her bed. Her spheres were getting dim; they'd go out soon, and would need to be reinfused with Stormlight. Shallan released a contented sigh and leaned back against her bed, her notes from a dozen different sources laid out on the floor of her small chamber. She felt . . . satisfied. Her brothers loved the plan of fixing the Soulcaster and returning it, and seemed energized by her suggestion that all was not lost. They thought they could last longer, now that a plan was in place. Shallan's life was coming together. How long had it been since she'd just been able to sit and read? Without worried concern for her house, without dreading the need to find a way to steal from Jasnah? Even before the terrible sequence of events that had led to her father's death, she had always been anxious. That had been her life. She'd seen becoming a true scholar as something unreachable. Stormfather! She'd seen the next town over as being unreachable. She stood up, gathering her sketchbook and flipping through her pictures of the santhid, including several drawn from the memory of her dip in the ocean. She smiled at that, recalling how she'd climbed back up on deck, dripping wet and grinning. The sailors had all obviously thought her mad. Now she was sailing toward a city on the edge of the world, betrothed to a powerful Alethi prince, and was free to just learn. She was seeing incredible new sights, sketching them during the days, then reading through piles of books in the nights. She had stumbled into the perfect life, and it was everything she'd wished for. Shallan fished in the pocket inside her safehand sleeve, digging out some more spheres to replace those dimming in the goblet. The ones her hand emerged with, however, were completely dun. Not a glimmer of Light in them. She frowned. These had been restored during the previous highstorm, held in a basket tied to the ship's mast. The ones in her goblet were two storms old now, which was why they were running out. How had the ones in her pocket gone dun faster? It defied reason. "Mmmmm . . ." Pattern said from the wall near her head. "Lies." Shallan replaced the spheres in her pocket, then opened the door into the ship's narrow companionway and moved to Jasnah's cabin. It was the cabin that Tozbek and his wife usually shared, but they had vacated it for the thirdand smallestof the cabins to give Jasnah the better quarters. People did things like that for her, even when she didn't ask. Jasnah would have some spheres for Shallan to use. Indeed, Jasnah's door was cracked open, swaying slightly as the ship creaked and rocked along its evening path. Jasnah sat at the desk inside, and Shallan peeked in, suddenly uncertain if she wanted to bother the woman. She could see Jasnah's face, hand against her temple, staring at the pages spread before her. Jasnah's eyes were haunted, her expression haggard. This was not the Jasnah that Shallan was accustomed to seeing. The confidence had been overwhelmed by exhaustion, the poise replaced by worry. Jasnah started to write something, but stopped after just a few words. She set down the pen, closing her eyes and massaging her temples. A few dizzylooking spren, like jets of dust rising into the air, appeared around Jasnah's head. Exhaustionspren. Shallan pulled back, suddenly feeling as if she'd intruded upon an intimate moment. Jasnah with her defenses down. Shallan began to creep away, but a voice from the floor suddenly said, "Truth!" Startled, Jasnah looked up, eyes finding Shallanwho, of course, blushed furiously. Jasnah turned her eyes down toward Pattern on the floor, then reset her mask, sitting up with proper posture. "Yes, child?" "I . . . I needed spheres . . ." Shallan said. "Those in my pouch went dun." "Have you been Soulcasting?" Jasnah asked sharply. "What? No, Brightness. I promised I would not." "Then it is the second ability," Jasnah said. "Come in and close that door. I should speak to Captain Tozbek; it won't latch properly." Shallan stepped in, pushing the door closed, though the latch didn't catch. She stepped forward, hands clasped, feeling embarrassed. "What did you do?" Jasnah asked. "It involved light, I assume?" "I seemed to make plants appear," Shallan said. "Well, really just the color. One of the sailors saw the deck turn green, but it vanished when I stopped thinking about the plants." "Yes . . ." Jasnah said. She flipped through one of her books, stopping at an illustration. Shallan had seen it before; it was as ancient as Vorinism. Ten spheres connected by lines forming a shape like an hourglass on its side. Two of the spheres at the center looked almost like pupils. The Double Eye of the Almighty. "Ten Essences," Jasnah said softly. She ran her fingers along the page. "Ten Surges. Ten orders. But what does it mean that the spren have finally decided to return the oaths to us? And how much time remains to me? Not long. Not long . . ." "Brightness?" Shallan asked. "Before your arrival, I could assume I was an anomaly," Jasnah said. "I could hope that Surgebindings were not returning in large numbers. I no longer have that hope. The Cryptics sent you to me, of that I have no doubt, because they knew you would need training. That gives me hope that I was at least one of the first." "I don't understand." Jasnah looked up toward Shallan, meeting her eyes with an intense gaze. The woman's eyes were reddened with fatigue. How late was she working? Every night when Shallan turned in, there was still light coming from under Jasnah's door. "To be honest," Jasnah said, "I don't understand either." "Are you all right?" Shallan asked. "Before I entered, you seemed . . . distressed." Jasnah hesitated just briefly. "I have merely been spending too long at my studies." She turned to one of her trunks, digging out a dark cloth pouch filled with spheres. "Take these. I would suggest that you keep spheres with you at all times, so that your Surgebinding has the opportunity to manifest." "Can you teach me?" Shallan asked, taking the pouch. "I don't know," Jasnah said. "I will try. On this diagram, one of the Surges is known as Illumination, the mastery of light. For now, I would prefer you expend your efforts on learning this Surge, as opposed to Soulcasting. That is a dangerous art, more so now than it once was." Shallan nodded, rising. She hesitated before leaving, however. "Are you sure you are well?" "Of course." She said it too quickly. The woman was poised, in control, but also obviously exhausted. The mask was cracked, and Shallan could see the truth. She's trying to placate me, Shallan realized. Pat me on the head and send me back to bed, like a child awakened by a nightmare. "You're worried," Shallan said, meeting Jasnah's eyes. The woman turned away. She pushed a book over something wiggling on her tablea small purple spren. Fearspren. Only one, true, but still. "No . . ." Shallan whispered. "You're not worried. You're terrified." Stormfather! "It is all right, Shallan," Jasnah said. "I just need some sleep. Go back to your studies." Shallan sat down on the stool beside Jasnah's desk. The older woman looked back at her, and Shallan could see the mask cracking further. Annoyance as Jasnah drew her lips to a line. Tension in the way she held her pen, in a fist. "You told me I could be part of this," Shallan said. "Jasnah, if you're worried about something . . ." "My worry is what it has always been," Jasnah said, leaning back in her chair. "That I will be too late. That I'm incapable of doing anything meaningful to stop what is comingthat I'm trying to stop a highstorm by blowing against it really hard." "The Voidbringers," Shallan said. "The parshmen." "In the past," Jasnah said, "the Desolationthe coming of the Voidbringers was supposedly always marked by a return of the Heralds to prepare mankind. They would train the Knights Radiant, who would experience a rush of new members." "But we captured the Voidbringers," Shallan said. "And enslaved them." That was what Jasnah postulated, and Shallan agreed, having seen the research. "So you think a kind of revolution is coming. That the parshmen will turn against us as they did in the past." "Yes," Jasnah said, rifling through her notes. "And soon. Your proving to be a Surgebinder does not comfort me, as it smacks too much of what happened before. But back then, new knights had teachers to train them, generations of tradition. We have nothing." "The Voidbringers are captive," Shallan said, glancing toward Pattern. He rested on the floor, almost invisible, saying nothing. "The parshmen can barely communicate. How could they possibly stage a revolution?" Jasnah found the sheet of paper she'd been seeking and handed it to Shallan. Written in Jasnah's own hand, it was an account by a captain's wife of a plateau assault on the Shattered Plains. "Parshendi," Jasnah said, "can sing in time with one another no matter how far they are separated. They have some ability to communicate that we do not understand. I can only assume that their cousins the parshmen have the same. They may not need to hear a call to action in order to revolt." Shallan read the report, nodding slowly. "We need to warn others, Jasnah." "You don't think I've tried?" Jasnah asked. "I've written to scholars and kings all around the world. Most dismiss me as paranoid. The evidence you readily accept, others call flimsy. "The ardents were my best hope, but their eyes are clouded by the interference of the Hierocracy. Besides, my personal beliefs make ardents skeptical of anything I say. My mother wants to see my research, which is something. My brother and uncle might believe, and that is why we are going to them." She hesitated. "There is another reason we seek the Shattered Plains. A way to find evidence that might convince everyone." "Urithiru," Shallan said. "The city you seek?" Jasnah gave her another curt glance. The ancient city was something Shallan had first learned about by secretly reading Jasnah's notes. "You still blush too easily when confronted," Jasnah noted. "I'm sorry." "And apologize too easily as well." "I'm . . . uh, indignant?" Jasnah smiled, picking up the representation of the Double Eye. She stared at it. "There is a secret hidden somewhere on the Shattered Plains. A secret about Urithiru." "You told me the city wasn't there!" "It isn't. But the path to it may be." Her lips tightened. "According to legend, only a Knight Radiant could open the way." "Fortunately, we know two of those." "Again, you are not a Radiant, and neither am I. Being able to replicate some of the things they could do may not matter. We don't have their traditions or knowledge." "We're talking about the potential end of civilization itself, aren't we?" Shallan asked softly. Jasnah hesitated. "The Desolations," Shallan said. "I know very little, but the legends . . ." "In the aftermath of each one, mankind was broken. Great cities in ashes, industry smashed. Each time, knowledge and growth were reduced to an almost prehistoric stateit took centuries of rebuilding to restore civilization to what it had been before." She hesitated. "I keep hoping that I'm wrong." "Urithiru," Shallan said. She tried to refrain from just asking questions, trying instead to reason her way to the answer. "You said the city was a kind of base or home to the Knights Radiant. I hadn't heard of it before speaking with you, and so can guess that it's not commonly referred to in the literature. Perhaps, then, it is one of the things that the Hierocracy suppressed knowledge of?" "Very good," Jasnah said. "Although I think that it had begun to fade into legend even before then, the Hierocracy did not help." "So if it existed before the Hierocracy, and if the pathway to it was locked at the fall of the Radiants . . . then it might contain records that have not been touched by modern scholars. Unaltered, unchanged lore about the Voidbringers and Surgebinding." Shallan shivered. "That's why we're really going to the Shattered Plains." Jasnah smiled through her fatigue. "Very good indeed. My time in the Palanaeum was very useful, but also in some ways disappointing. While I confirmed my suspicions about the parshmen, I also found that many of the great library's records bore the same signs of tampering as others I'd read. This 'cleansing' of history, removing direct references to Urithiru or the Radiants because they were embarrassments to Vorinismit's infuriating. And people ask me why I am hostile to the church! I need primary sources. And then, there are storiesones I dare to believeclaiming that Urithiru was holy and protected from the Voidbringers. Maybe that was wishful fancy, but I am not too much a scholar to hope that something like that might be true." "And the parshmen?" "We will try to persuade the Alethi to rid themselves of those." "Not an easy task." "A nearly impossible one," Jasnah said, standing. She began to pack her books away for the night, putting them in her waterproofed trunk. "Parshmen are such perfect slaves. Docile, obedient. Our society has become far too reliant upon them. The parshmen wouldn't need to turn violent to throw us into chaos though I'm certain that is what's comingthey could simply walk away. It would cause an economic crisis." She closed the trunk after removing one volume, then turned back to Shallan. "Convincing everyone of what I say is beyond us without more evidence. Even if my brother listens, he doesn't have the authority to force the highprinces to get rid of their parshmen. And, in all honesty, I fear my brother won't be brave enough to risk the collapse expelling the parshmen might cause." "But if they turn on us, the collapse will come anyway." "Yes," Jasnah said. "You know this, and I know it. My mother might believe it. But the risk of being wrong is so immense that . . . well, we will need evidenceoverwhelming and irrefutable evidence. So we find the city. At all costs, we find that city." Shallan nodded. "I did not want to lay all of this upon your shoulders, child," Jasnah said, sitting back down. "However, I will admit that it is a relief to speak of these things to someone who doesn't challenge me on every other point." "We'll do it, Jasnah," Shallan said. "We'll travel to the Shattered Plains and we'll find Urithiru. We'll get the evidence and convince everyone to listen." "Ah, the optimism of youth," Jasnah said. "That is nice to hear on occasion too." She handed the book to Shallan. "Among the Knights Radiant, there was an order known as the Lightweavers. I know precious little about them, but of all the sources I've read, this one has the most information." Shallan took the volume eagerly. Words of Radiance, the title read. "Go," Jasnah said. "Read." Shallan glanced at her. "I will sleep," Jasnah promised, a smile creeping to her lips. "And stop trying to mother me. I don't even let Navani do that." Shallan sighed, nodding, and left Jasnah's quarters. Pattern tagged along behind; he'd spent the entire conversation silent. As she entered her cabin, she found herself much heavier of heart than when she'd left it. She couldn't banish the image of terror in Jasnah's eyes. Jasnah Kholin shouldn't fear anything, should she? Shallan crawled onto her cot with the book she'd been given and the pouch of spheres. Part of her was eager to begin, but she was exhausted, her eyelids drooping. It really had gotten late. If she started the book now . . . Perhaps better to get a good night's sleep, then dig refreshed into a new day's studies. She set the book on the small table beside her bed, curled up, and let the rocking of the boat coax her to sleep. She awoke to screams, shouts, and smoke. I was unprepared for the grief my loss broughtlike an unexpected rainbreaking from a clear sky and crashing down upon me. Gavilar's death years ago was overwhelming, but this . . . this nearly crushed me. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesach 1174 Still half asleep, Shallan panicked. She scrambled off her cot, accidentally slapping the goblet of mostly drained spheres. Though she used wax to keep it in place, the swat knocked it free and sent spheres tumbling across her cabin. The scent of smoke was powerful. She ran to her door, disheveled, heart thumping. At least she'd fallen asleep in her clothing. She threw open the door. Three men crowded in the passageway outside, holding aloft torches, their backs to her. Torches, sparking with flamespren dancing about the fires. Who brought open flame onto a ship? Shallan stopped in numb confusion. The shouts came from the deck above, and it seemed that the ship wasn't on fire. But who were these men? They carried axes, and were focused on Jasnah's cabin, which was open. Figures moved inside. In a frozen moment of horror, one threw something to the floor before the others, who stepped aside to make way. A body in a thin nightgown, eyes staring sightlessly, blood blossoming from the breast. Jasnah. "Be sure," one of the men said. The other one knelt and rammed a long, thin knife right into Jasnah's chest. Shallan heard it hit the wood of the floor beneath the body. Shallan screamed. One of the men spun toward her. "Hey!" It was the bluntfaced, tall fellow that Yalb had called the "new kid." She didn't recognize the other men. Somehow fighting through the terror and disbelief, Shallan slammed her door and threw the bolt with trembling fingers. Stormfather! Stormfather! She backed away from the door as something heavy hit the other side. They wouldn't need the axes. A few determined smashes of shoulder to door would bring it down. Shallan stumbled back against her cot, nearly slipping on the spheres rolling to and fro with the ship's motion. The narrow window near the ceilingfar too small to fit throughrevealed only the dark of night outside. Shouts continued above, feet thumping on wood. Shallan trembled, still numb. Jasnah. . . . "Sword," a voice said. Pattern, hanging on the wall beside her. "Mmmm . . . The sword . . ." "No!" Shallan screamed, hands to the sides of her head, fingers in her hair. Stormfather! She was trembling. Nightmare. It was a nightmare! It couldn't be "Mmmm . . . Fight . . ." "No!" Shallan found herself hyperventilating as the men outside continued to ram their shoulders against her door. She was not ready for this. She was not prepared. "Mmmm . . ." Pattern said, sounding dissatisfied. "Lies." "I don't know how to use the lies!" Shallan said. "I haven't practiced." "Yes. Yes . . . remember . . . the time before . . ." The door crunched. Dared she remember? Could she remember? A child, playing with a shimmering pattern of light . . . "What do I do?" she asked. "You need the Light," Pattern said. It sparked something deep within her memory, something prickled with barbs she dared not touch. She needed Stormlight to fuel the Surgebinding. Shallan fell to her knees beside her cot and, without knowing exactly what she was doing, breathed in sharply. Stormlight left the spheres around her, pouring into her body, becoming a storm that raged in her veins. The cabin went dark, black as a cavern deep beneath the earth. Then Light began to rise from her skin like vapors off boiling water. It lit the cabin with swimming shadows. "Now what?" she demanded. "Shape the lie." What did that mean? The door crunched again, cracking, a large split opening down the center. Panicked, Shallan let out a breath. Stormlight streamed from her in a cloud; she almost felt as if she could touch it. She could feel its potential. "How!" she demanded. "Make the truth." "That makes no sense!" Shallan screamed as the door broke open. New light entered the cabin, torchlightred and yellow, hostile. The cloud of Light leaped from Shallan, more Stormlight streaming from her body to join it. It formed a vague upright shape. An illuminated blur. It washed past the men through the doorway, waving appendages that could have been arms. Shallan herself, kneeling by the bed, fell into shadow. The men's eyes were drawn to the glowing shape. Then, blessedly, they turned and gave chase. Shallan huddled against the wall, shaking. The cabin was utterly dark. Above, men screamed. "Shallan . . ." Pattern buzzed somewhere in the darkness. "Go and look," she said. "Tell me what is happening up on deck." She didn't know if he obeyed, as he made no sound when he moved. After a few deep breaths, Shallan stood up. Her legs shook, but she stood. She collected herself somewhat. This was terrible, this was awful, but nothing, nothing, could compare to what she'd had to do the night her father died. She had survived that. She could survive this. These men, they would be of the same group Kabsal had been fromthe assassins Jasnah feared. They had finally gotten her. Oh, Jasnah . . . Jasnah was dead. Grieve later. What was Shallan going to do about armed men taking over the ship? How would she find a way out? She felt her way out into the passageway. There was a little light here, from torches above on the deck. The yells she heard there grew more panicked. "Killing," a voice suddenly said. She jumped, though of course it was only Pattern. "What?" Shallan hissed. "Dark men killing," Pattern said. "Sailors tied in ropes. One dead, bleeding red. I . . . I do not understand. . . ." Oh, Stormfather . . . Above, the shouting heightened, but there was no scramble of boots on the deck, no clanging of weapons. The sailors had been captured. At least one had been killed. In the darkness, Shallan saw shaking, wiggling forms creep up from the wood around her. Fearspren. "What of the men who chased after my image?" she asked. "Looking in water," Pattern said. So they thought she'd jumped overboard. Heart thumping, Shallan felt her way to Jasnah's cabin, expecting at any moment to trip over the woman's corpse on the floor. She didn't. Had the men dragged it above? Shallan entered Jasnah's cabin and closed the door. It wouldn't latch shut, so she pulled a box over to block it. She had to do something. She felt her way to one of Jasnah's trunks, which had been thrown open by the men, its contentsclothingscattered about. In the bottom, Shallan found the hidden drawer and pulled it open. Light suddenly bathed the cabin. The spheres were so bright they blinded Shallan for a moment, and she had to look away. Pattern vibrated on the floor beside her, form shaking in worry. Shallan looked about. The small cabin was a shambles, clothing on the floor, papers strewn everywhere. The trunk with Jasnah's books was gone. Too fresh to have soaked in, blood was pooled on the bed. Shallan quickly looked away. A shout suddenly sounded above, followed by a thump. The screaming grew louder. She heard Tozbek bellow for the men to spare his wife. Almighty above . . . the assassins were executing the sailors one at a time. Shallan had to do something. Anything. Shallan looked back at the spheres in their false bottom, lined with black cloth. "Pattern," she said, "we're going to Soulcast the bottom of the ship and sink it." "What!" His vibrating increased, a buzz of sound. "Humans . . . Humans . . . Eat water?" "We drink it," Shallan said, "but we cannot breathe it." "Mmmm . . . Confused . . ." Pattern said. "The captain and the others are captured and being executed. The best chance I can give them is chaos." Shallan placed her hands on the spheres and drew in the Light with a sharp breath. She felt afire with it inside of her, as if she were going to burst. The Light was a living thing, trying to press out through the pores of her skin. "Show me!" she shouted, far more loudly than she'd intended. That Stormlight urged her to action. "I've Soulcast before. I must do it again!" Stormlight puffed from her mouth as she spoke, like breath on a cold day. "Mmmmm . . ." Pattern said anxiously. "I will intercede. See." "See what?" "See!" Shadesmar. The last time she'd gone to that place, she'd nearly gotten herself killed. Only, it wasn't a place. Or was it? Did it matter? She reached back through recent memory to the time when she'd last Soulcast and accidentally turned a goblet into blood. "I need a truth." "You have given enough," Pattern said. "Now. See." The ship vanished. Everything . . . popped. The walls, the furniture, it all shattered into little globes of black glass. Shallan prepared herself to fall into the ocean of those glass beads, but instead she dropped onto solid ground. She stood in a place with a black sky and a tiny, distant sun. The ground beneath her reflected light. Obsidian? Each way she turned, the ground was made of that same blackness. Nearby, the sphereslike those that would hold Stormlight, but dark and smallbounced to a rest on the ground. Trees, like growing crystal, clustered here and there. The limbs were spiky and glassy, without leaves. Nearby, little lights hung in the air, flames without their candles. People, she realized. Those are each a person's mind, reflected here in the Cognitive Realm. Smaller ones were scattered about her feet, dozens upon dozens, but so small she almost couldn't make them out. The minds of fish? She turned around and came facetoface with a creature that had a symbol for a head. Startled, she screamed and jumped back. These things . . . they had haunted her . . . they . . . It was Pattern. He stood tall and willowy, but slightly indistinct, translucent. The complex pattern of his head, with its sharp lines and impossible geometries, seemed to have no eyes. He stood with hands behind his back, wearing a robe that seemed too stiff to be cloth. "Go," he said. "Choose." "Choose what?" she said, Stormlight escaping her lips. "Your ship." He did not have eyes, but she thought she could follow his gaze toward one of the little spheres on the glassy ground. She snatched it, and suddenly was given the impression of a ship. The Wind's Pleasure. A ship that had been cared for, loved. It had carried its passengers well for years and years, owned by Tozbek and his father before him. An old ship, but not ancient, still reliable. A proud ship. It manifested here as a sphere. It could actually think. The ship could think. Or . . . well, it reflected the thoughts of the people who served on it, knew it, thought about it. "I need you to change," Shallan whispered to it, cradling the bead in her hands. It was too heavy for its size, as if the entire weight of the ship had been compressed to this singular bead. "No," the reply came, though it was Pattern who spoke. "No, I cannot. I must serve. I am happy." Shallan looked to him. "I will intercede," Pattern repeated. ". . . Translate. You are not ready." Shallan looked back to the bead in her hands. "I have Stormlight. Lots of it. I will give it to you." "No!" the reply seemed angry. "I serve." It really wanted to stay a ship. She could feel it, the pride it took, the reinforcement of years of service. "They are dying," she whispered. "No!" "You can feel them dying. Their blood on your deck. One by one, the people you serve will be cut down." She could feel it herself, could see it in the ship. They were being executed. Nearby, one of the floating candle flames vanished. Three of the eight captives dead, though she did not know which ones. "There is only one chance to save them," Shallan said. "And that is to change." "Change," Pattern whispered for the ship. "If you change, they might escape the evil men who kill," Shallan whispered. "It is uncertain, but they will have a chance to swim. To do something. You can do them a last service, Wind's Pleasure. Change for them." Silence. "I . . ." Another light vanished. "I will change." It happened in a hectic second; the Stormlight ripped from Shallan. She heard distant cracks from the physical world as she withdrew so much Light from the nearby gemstones that they shattered. Shadesmar vanished. She was back in Jasnah's cabin. The floor, walls, and ceiling melted into water. Shallan was plunged into the icy black depths. She thrashed in the water, dress hampering her movements. All around her, objects sank, the common artifacts of human life. Frantic, she searched for the surface. Originally, she'd had some vague idea of swimming out and helping untie the sailors, if they were bound. Now, however, she found herself desperately even trying to find the way up. As if the darkness itself had come alive, something wrapped around her. It pulled her farther into the deep. I seek not to use my grief as an excuse, but it is an explanation. People act strangely soon after encountering an unexpected loss. Though Jasnah had been away for some time, her loss was unexpected. I, like many, assumed her to be immortal. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesach 1174 The familiar scraping of wood as a bridge slid into place. The stomping of feet in unison, first a flat sound on stone, then the ringing thump of boots on wood. The distant calls of scouts, shouting back the allclear. The sounds of a plateau run were familiar to Dalinar. Once, he had craved these sounds. He'd been impatient between runs, longing for the chance to strike down Parshendi with his Blade, to win wealth and recognition. That Dalinar had been seeking to cover up his shamethe shame of lying slumped in a drunken stupor while his brother fought an assassin. The setting of a plateau run was uniform: bare, jagged rocks, mostly the same dull color as the stone surface they sat on, broken only by the occasional cluster of closed rockbuds. Even those, as their name implied, could be mistaken for more rocks. There was nothing but more of the same from here where you stood, all the way out to the far horizon; and everything you'd brought with you, everything human, was dwarfed by the vastness of these endless, fractured plains and deadly chasms. Over the years, this activity had become rote. Marching beneath that white sun like molten steel. Crossing gap after gap. Eventually, plateau runs had become less something to anticipate and more a dogged obligation. For Gavilar and glory, yes, but mainly because theyand the enemywere here. This was what you did. The scents of a plateau run were the scents of a great stillness: baked stone, dried crem, longtraveled winds. Most recently, Dalinar was coming to detest plateau runs. They were a frivolity, a waste of life. They weren't about fulfilling the Vengeance Pact, but about greed. Many gemhearts appeared on the near plateaus, convenient to reach. Those didn't sate the Alethi. They had to reach farther, toward assaults that cost dearly. Ahead, Highprince Aladar's men fought on a plateau. They had arrived before Dalinar's army, and the conflict told a familiar story. Men against Parshendi, fighting in a sinuous line, each army trying to shove the other back. The humans could field far more men than the Parshendi, but the Parshendi could reach plateaus faster and secure them quickly. The scattered bodies of bridgemen on the staging plateau, leading up to the chasm, attested to the danger of charging an entrenched foe. Dalinar did not miss the dark expressions on his bodyguards' faces as they surveyed the dead. Aladar, like most of the other highprinces, used Sadeas's philosophy on bridge runs. Quick, brutal assaults that treated manpower as an expendable resource. It hadn't always been this way. In the past, bridges had been carried by armored troops, but success bred imitation. The warcamps needed a constant influx of cheap slaves to feed the monster. That meant a growing plague of slavers and bandits roaming the Unclaimed Hills, trading in flesh. Another thing I'll have to change, Dalinar thought. Aladar himself didn't fight, but had instead set up a command center on an adjacent plateau. Dalinar pointed toward the flapping banner, and one of his large mechanical bridges rolled into place. Pulled by chulls and full of gears, levers, and cams, the bridges protected the men who worked them. They were also very slow. Dalinar waited with selfdisciplined patience as the workers ratcheted the bridge down, spanning the chasm between this plateau and the one where Aladar's banner flew. Once the bridge was in position and locked, his bodyguardled by one of Captain Kaladin's darkeyed officerstrotted onto it, spears to shoulders. Dalinar had promised Kaladin his men would not have to fight except to defend him. Once they were across, Dalinar kicked Gallant into motion to cross to Aladar's command plateau. Dalinar felt too light on the stallion's backthe lack of Shardplate. In the many years since he'd obtained his suit, he'd never gone out onto a battlefield without it. Today, however, he didn't ride to battlenot truly. Behind him, Adolin's own personal banner flew, and he led the bulk of Dalinar's armies to assault the plateau where Aladar's men already fought. Dalinar didn't send any orders regarding how the assault should go. His son had been trained well, and he was ready to take battlefield commandwith General Khal at his side, of course, for advice. Yes, from now on, Adolin would lead the battles. Dalinar would change the world. He rode toward Aladar's command tent. This was the first plateau run following his proclamation requiring the armies to work together. The fact that Aladar had come as commanded, and Roion had noteven though the target plateau was closest to Roion's warcampwas a victory unto itself. A small encouragement, but Dalinar would take what he could get. He found Highprince Aladar watching from a small pavilion set up on a secure, raised part of this plateau overlooking the battlefield. A perfect location for a command post. Aladar was a Shardbearer, though he commonly lent his Plate and Blade to one of his officers during battles, preferring to lead tactically from behind the battle lines. A practiced Shardbearer could mentally command a Blade to not dissolve when he let go of it, thoughin an emergencyAladar could summon it to himself, making it vanish from the hands of his officer in an eyeblink, then appear in his own hands ten heartbeats later. Lending a Blade required a great deal of trust on both sides. Dalinar dismounted. His horse, Gallant, glared at the groom who tried to take him, and Dalinar patted the horse on the neck. "He'll be fine on his own, son," he said to the groom. Most common grooms didn't know what to do with one of the Ryshadium anyway. Trailed by his bridgeman guards, Dalinar joined Aladar, who stood at the edge of the plateau, overseeing the battlefield ahead and just below. Slender and completely bald, the man had skin a darker tan than most Alethi. He stood with hands behind his back, and wore a sharp traditional uniform with a skirtlike takama, though he wore a modern jacket above it, cut to match the takama. It was a style Dalinar had never seen before. Aladar also wore a thin mustache and a tuft of hair beneath his lip, again an unconventional choice. Aladar was powerful enough, and renowned enough, to make his own fashionand he did so, often setting trends. "Dalinar," Aladar said, nodding to him. "I thought you weren't going to fight on plateau runs any longer." "I'm not," Dalinar said, nodding toward Adolin's banner. There, soldiers streamed across Dalinar's bridges to join the battle. The plateau was small enough that many of Aladar's men had to withdraw to make way, something they were obviously all too eager to do. "You almost lost this day," Dalinar noted. "It is well that you had support." Below, Dalinar's troops restored order to the battlefield and pushed against the Parshendi. "Perhaps," Aladar said. "Yet in the past, I was victorious in one out of three assaults. Having support will mean I win a few more, certainly, but will also cost half my earnings. Assuming the king even assigns me any. I'm not convinced that I'll be better off in the long run." "But this way, you lose fewer men," Dalinar said. "And the total winnings for the entire army will rise. The honor of the" "Don't talk to me about honor, Dalinar. I can't pay my soldiers with honor, and I can't use it to keep the other highprinces from snapping at my neck. Your plan favors the weakest among us and undercuts the successful." "Fine," Dalinar snapped, "honor has no value to you. You will still obey, Aladar, because your king demands it. That is the only reason you need. You will do as told." "Or?" Aladar said. "Ask Yenev." Aladar started as if slapped. Ten years back, Highprince Yenev had refused to accept the unification of Alethkar. At Gavilar's order, Sadeas had dueled the man. And killed him. "Threats?" Aladar asked. "Yes." Dalinar turned to look the shorter man in the eyes. "I'm done cajoling, Aladar. I'm done asking. When you disobey Elhokar, you mock my brother and what he stood for. I will have a unified kingdom." "Amusing," Aladar said. "Good of you to mention Gavilar, as he didn't bring the kingdom together with honor. He did it with knives in the back and soldiers on the field, cutting the heads off any who resisted. Are we back to that again, then? Such things don't sound much like the fine words of your precious book." Dalinar ground his teeth, turning away to watch the battlefield. His first instinct was to tell Aladar he was an officer under Dalinar's command, and take the man to task for his tone. Treat him like a recruit in need of correction. But what if Aladar just ignored him? Would he force the man to obey? Dalinar didn't have the troops for it. He found himself annoyedmore at himself than at Aladar. He'd come on this plateau run not to fight, but to talk. To persuade. Navani was right. Dalinar needed more than brusque words and military commands to save this kingdom. He needed loyalty, not fear. But storms take him, how? What persuading he'd done in life, he'd accomplished with a sword in hand and a fist to the face. Gavilar had always been the one with the right words, the one who could make people listen. Dalinar had no business trying to be a politician. Half the lads on that battlefield probably didn't think they had any business being soldiers, at first, a part of him whispered. You don't have the luxury of being bad at this. Don't complain. Change. "The Parshendi are pushing too hard," Aladar said to his generals. "They want to shove us off the plateau. Tell the men to give a little and let the Parshendi lose their advantage of footing; that will let us surround them." The generals nodded, one calling out orders. Dalinar narrowed his eyes at the battlefield, reading it. "No," he said softly. The general stopped giving orders. Aladar glanced at Dalinar. "The Parshendi are preparing to pull back," Dalinar said. "They certainly don't act like it." "They want some room to breathe," Dalinar said, reading the swirl of combat below. "They nearly have the gemheart harvested. They will continue to push hard, but will break into a quick retreat around the chrysalis to buy time for the final harvesting. That's what you'll need to stop." The Parshendi surged forward. "I took point on this run," Aladar said. "By your own rules, I get final say over our tactics." "I observe only," Dalinar said. "I'm not even commanding my own army today. You may choose your tactics, and I will not interfere." Aladar considered, then cursed softly. "Assume Dalinar is correct. Prepare the men for a withdrawal by the Parshendi. Send a strike team forward to secure the chrysalis, which should be almost opened up." The generals set up the new details, and messengers raced off with the tactical orders. Aladar and Dalinar watched, side by side, as the Parshendi shoved forward. That singing of theirs hovered over the battlefield. Then they pulled back, careful as always to respectfully step over the bodies of the dead. Ready for this, the human troops rushed after. Led by Adolin in gleaming Plate, a strike force of fresh troops broke through the Parshendi line and reached the chrysalis. Other human troops poured through the gap they opened, shoving the Parshendi to the flanks, turning the Parshendi withdrawal into a tactical disaster. In minutes, the Parshendi had abandoned the plateau, jumping away and fleeing. "Damnation," Aladar said softly. "I hate that you're so good at this." Dalinar narrowed his eyes, noticing that some of the fleeing Parshendi stopped on a plateau a short distance from the battlefield. They lingered there, though much of their force continued on away. Dalinar waved for one of Aladar's servants to hand him a spyglass, then he raised it, focusing on that group. A figure stood at the edge of the plateau out there, a figure in glistening armor. The Parshendi Shardbearer, he thought. The one from the battle at the Tower. He almost killed me. Dalinar didn't remember much from that encounter. He'd been beaten near senseless toward the end of it. This Shardbearer hadn't participated in today's battle. Why? Surely with a Shardbearer, they could have opened the chrysalis sooner. Dalinar felt a disturbing pit inside of him. This one fact, the watching Shardbearer, changed his understanding of the battle entirely. He thought he'd been able to read what was going on. Now it occurred to him that the enemy's tactics were more opaque than he'd assumed. "Are some of them still out there?" Aladar asked. "Watching?" Dalinar nodded, lowering his spyglass. "Have they done that before in any battle you've fought?" Dalinar shook his head. Aladar mulled for a moment, then gave orders for his men on the plateau to remain alert, with scouts posted to watch for a surprise return of the Parshendi. "Thank you," Aladar added, grudgingly, turning to Dalinar. "Your advice proved helpful." "You trusted me when it came to tactics," Dalinar said, turning to him. "Why not try trusting me in what is best for this kingdom?" Aladar studied him. Behind, soldiers cheered their victory and Adolin ripped the gemheart free from the chrysalis. Others fanned out to watch for a return attack, but none came. "I wish I could, Dalinar," Aladar finally said. "But this isn't about you. It's about the other highprinces. Maybe I could trust you, but I'll never trust them. You're asking me to risk too much of myself. The others would do to me what Sadeas did to you on the Tower." "What if I can bring the others around? What if I can prove to you that they're worthy of trust? What if I can change the direction of this kingdom, and this war? Will you follow me then?" "No," Aladar said. "I'm sorry." He turned away, calling for his horse. The trip back was miserable. They'd won the day, but Aladar kept his distance. How could Dalinar do so many things so right, yet still be unable to persuade men like Aladar? And what did it mean that the Parshendi were changing tactics on the battlefield, not committing their Shardbearer? Were they too afraid to lose their Shards? When, at long last, Dalinar returned to his bunker in the warcampsafter seeing to his men and sending a report to the kinghe found an unexpected letter waiting for him. He sent for Navani to read him the words. Dalinar stood waiting in his private study, staring at the wall that had borne the strange glyphs. Those had been sanded away, the scratches hidden, but the pale patch of stone whispered. Sixtytwo days. Sixtytwo days to come up with an answer. Well, sixty now. Not much time to save a kingdom, to prepare for the worst. The ardents would condemn the prophecy as a prank at best, or blasphemous at worst. To foretell the future was forbidden. It was of the Voidbringers. Even games of chance were suspect, for they incited men to look for the secrets of what was to come. He believed anyway. For he suspected his own hand had written those words. Navani arrived and looked over the letter, then started reading aloud. It turned out to be from an old friend who was going to arrive soon on the Shattered Plainsand who might provide a solution to Dalinar's problems. I wish to think that had I not been under sorrow's thumb, I would have seen earlier the approaching dangers. Yet in all honesty, I'm not certain anything could have been done. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesach 1174 Kaladin led the way down into the chasms, as was his right. They used a rope ladder, as they had in Sadeas's army. Those ladders had been unsavory things, the ropes frayed and stained with moss, the planks battered by far too many highstorms. Kaladin had never lost a man because of those storming ladders, but he'd always worried. This one was brand new. He knew that for a fact, as Rind the quartermaster had scratched his head at the request, and then had one built to Kaladin's specifications. It was sturdy and well made, like Dalinar's army itself. Kaladin reached the bottom with a final hop. Syl floated down and landed on his shoulder as he held up a sphere to survey the chasm bottom. The single sapphire broam was worth more by itself than the entirety of his wages as a bridgeman. In Sadeas's army, the chasms had been a frequent destination for bridgemen. Kaladin still didn't know if the purpose had been to scavenge every possible resource from the Shattered Plains, or if it had really been about finding something menialand willbreakingfor bridgemen to do between runs. The chasm bottom here, however, was untouched. There were no paths cut through the snarl of stormleavings on the ground, and there were no scratched messages or instructions in the lichen on the walls. Like the other chasms, this one opened up like a vase, wider at the bottom than at the cracked topa result of waters rushing through during highstorms. The floor was relatively flat, smoothed by the hardened sediment of settling crem. As he moved forward, Kaladin had to pick his way over all kinds of debris. Broken sticks and logs from trees blown in from across the Plains. Cracked rockbud shells. Countless tangles of dried vines, twisted through one another like discarded yarn. And bodies, of course. A lot of corpses ended up in the chasms. Whenever men lost their battle to seize a plateau, they had to retreat and leave their dead behind. Storms! Sadeas often left the corpses behind even if he wonand bridgemen he'd leave wounded, abandoned, even if they could have been saved. After a highstorm, the dead ended up here, in the chasms. And since storms blew westward, toward the warcamps, the bodies washed in this direction. Kaladin found it hard to move without stepping on bones entwined in the accumulated foliage on the chasm floor. He picked his way through as respectfully as he could as Rock reached the bottom behind him, uttering a quiet phrase in his native tongue. Kaladin couldn't tell if it was a curse or a prayer. Syl moved from Kaladin's shoulder, zipping into the air, then streaking in an arc to the ground. There, she formed into what he thought of as her true shape, that of a young woman with a simple dress that frayed to mist just below the knees. She perched on a branch and stared at a femur poking up through the moss. She didn't like violence. He wasn't certain if, even now, she understood death. She spoke of it like a child trying to grasp something beyond her. "What a mess," Teft said as he reached the bottom. "Bah! This place hasn't seen any kind of care at all." "It is a grave," Rock said. "We walk in a grave." "All of the chasms are graves," Teft said, his voice echoing in the dank confines. "This one's just a messy grave." "Hard to find death that isn't messy, Teft," Kaladin said. Teft grunted, then started to greet the new recruits as they reached the bottom. Moash and Skar were watching over Dalinar and his sons as they attended some lighteyed feastsomething that Kaladin was glad to be able to avoid. Instead, he'd come with Teft down here. They were joined by the forty bridgementwo from each reorganized crew that Teft was training with the hope that they'd make good sergeants for their own crews. "Take a good look, lads," Teft said to them. "This is where we come from. This is why some call us the order of bone. We're not going to make you go through everything we did, and be glad! We could have been swept away by a highstorm at any moment. Now, with Dalinar Kholin's stormwardens to guide us, we won't have nearly as much riskand we'll be staying close to the exit just in case . . ." Kaladin folded his arms, watching Teft instruct as Rock handed practice spears to the men. Teft himself carried no spear, and though he was shorter than the bridgemen who gathered around himwearing simple soldiers' uniforms they seemed thoroughly intimidated. What else did you expect? Kaladin thought. They're bridgemen. A stiff breeze could quell them. Still, Teft looked completely in control. Comfortably so. This was right. Something about it was just . . . right. A swarm of small glowing orbs materialized around Kaladin's head, spren the shape of golden spheres that darted this way and that. He started, looking at them. Gloryspren. Storms. He felt as if he hadn't seen the like in years. Syl zipped up into the air and joined them, giggling and spinning around Kaladin's head. "Feeling proud of yourself?" "Teft," Kaladin said. "He's a leader." "Of course he is. You gave him a rank, didn't you?" "No," Kaladin said. "I didn't give it to him. He claimed it. Come on. Let's walk." She nodded, alighting in the air and settling down, her legs crossed at the knees as if she were primly seating herself in an invisible chair. She continued to hover there, moving exactly in step with him. "Giving up all pretense of obeying natural laws again, I see," he said. "Natural laws?" Syl said, finding the concept amusing. "Laws are of men, Kaladin. Nature doesn't have them!" "If I toss something upward, it comes back down." "Except when it doesn't." "It's a law." "No," Syl said, looking upward. "It's more like . . . more like an agreement among friends." He looked at her, raising an eyebrow. "We have to be consistent," she said, leaning in conspiratorially. "Or we'll break your brains." He snorted, walking around a clump of bones and sticks pierced by a spear. Cankered with rust, it looked like a monument. "Oh, come on," Syl said, tossing her hair. "That was worth at least a chuckle." Kaladin kept walking. "A snort is not a chuckle," Syl said. "I know this because I am intelligent and articulate. You should compliment me now." "Dalinar Kholin wants to refound the Knights Radiant." "Yes," Syl said loftily, hanging in the corner of his vision. "A brilliant idea. I wish I'd thought of it." She grinned triumphantly, then scowled. "What?" he said, turning back to her. "Has it ever struck you as unfair," she said, "that spren cannot attract spren? I should really have had some gloryspren of my own there." "I have to protect Dalinar," Kaladin said, ignoring her complaint. "Not just him, but his family, maybe the king himself. Even though I failed to keep someone from sneaking into Dalinar's rooms." He still couldn't figure out how someone had managed to get in. Unless it hadn't been a person. "Could a spren have made those glyphs on the wall?" Syl had carried a leaf once. She had some physical form, just not much. "I don't know," she said, glancing to the side. "I've seen . . ." "What?" "Spren like red lightning," Syl said softly. "Dangerous spren. Spren I haven't seen before. I catch them in the distance, on occasion. Stormspren? Something dangerous is coming. About that, the glyphs are right." He chewed on that for a while, then finally stopped and looked at her. "Syl, are there others like me?" Her face grew solemn. "Oh." "Oh?" "Oh, that question." "You've been expecting it, then?" "Yeah. Sort of." "So you've had plenty of time to think about a good answer," Kaladin said, folding his arms and leaning back against a somewhat dry portion of the wall. "That makes me wonder if you've come up with a solid explanation or a solid lie." "Lie?" Syl said, aghast. "Kaladin! What do you think I am? A Cryptic?" "And what is a Cryptic?" Syl, still perched as if on a seat, sat up straight and cocked her head. "I actually . . . I actually have no idea. Huh." "Syl . . ." "I'm serious, Kaladin! I don't know. I don't remember." She grabbed her hair, one clump of white translucence in each hand, and pulled sideways. He frowned, then pointed. "That . . ." "I saw a woman do it in the market," Syl said, yanking her hair to the sides again. "It means I'm frustrated. I think it's supposed to hurt. So . . . ow? Anyway, it's not that I don't want to tell you what I know. I do! I just . . . I don't know what I know." "That doesn't make sense." "Well, imagine how frustrating it feels!" Kaladin sighed, then continued along the chasm, passing pools of stagnant water clotted with debris. A scattering of enterprising rockbuds grew stunted along one chasm wall. They must not get much light down here. He breathed in deeply the scents of overloaded life. Moss and mold. Most of the bodies here were mere bone, though he did steer clear of one patch of ground crawling with the red dots of rotspren. Just beside it, a group of frillblooms wafted their delicate fanlike fronds in the air, and those danced with green specks of lifespren. Life and death shook hands here in the chasms. He explored several of the chasm's branching paths. It felt odd to not know this area; he'd learned the chasms closest to Sadeas's camp better than the camp itself. As he walked, the chasm grew deeper and the area opened up. He made a few marks on the wall. Along one fork he found a round open area with little debris. He noted it, then walked back, marking the wall again before taking another branch. Eventually, they entered another place where the chasm opened up, widening into a roomy space. "Coming here was dangerous," Syl said. "Into the chasms?" Kaladin asked. "There aren't going to be any chasmfiends this close to the warcamps." "No. I meant for me, coming into this realm before I found you. It was dangerous." "Where were you before?" "Another place. With lots of spren. I can't remember well . . . it had lights in the air. Living lights." "Like lifespren." "Yes. And no. Coming here risked death. Without you, without a mind born of this realm, I couldn't think. Alone, I was just another windspren." "But you're not windspren," Kaladin said, kneeling beside a large pool of water. "You're honorspren." "Yes," Syl said. Kaladin closed his hand around his sphere, bringing neardarkness to the cavernous space. It was day above, but that crack of sky was distant, unreachable. Mounds of floodborne refuse fell into shadows that seemed almost to give them flesh again. Heaps of bones took on the semblance of limp arms, of corpses piled high. In a moment, Kaladin remembered it. Charging with a yell toward lines of Parshendi archers. His friends dying on barren plateaus, thrashing in their own blood. The thunder of hooves on stone. The incongruous chanting of alien tongues. The cries of men both lighteyed and dark. A world that cared nothing for bridgemen. They were refuse. Sacrifices to be cast into the chasms and carried away by the cleansing floods. This was their true home, these rents in the earth, these places lower than any other. As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, the memories of death receded, though he would never be free of them. He would forever bear those scars upon his memory like the many upon his flesh. Like the ones on his forehead. The pool in front of him glowed a deep violet. He'd noticed it earlier, but in the light of his sphere it had been harder to see. Now, in the dimness, the pool could reveal its eerie radiance. Syl landed on the side of the pool, looking like a woman standing on an ocean's shore. Kaladin frowned, leaning down to inspect her more closely. She seemed . . . different. Had her face changed shape? "There are others like you," Syl whispered. "I do not know them, but I know that other spren are trying, in their own way, to reclaim what was lost." She looked to him, and her face now had its familiar form. The fleeting change had been so subtle, Kaladin wasn't sure if he'd imagined it. "I am the only honorspren who has come," Syl said. "I . . ." She seemed to be stretching to remember. "I was forbidden. I came anyway. To find you." "You knew me?" "No. But I knew I'd find you." She smiled. "I spent the time with my cousins, searching." "The windspren." "Without the bond, I am basically one of them," she said. "Though they don't have the capacity to do what we do. And what we do is important. So important that I left everything, defying the Stormfather, to come. You saw him. In the storm." The hair stood up on Kaladin's arms. He had indeed seen a being in the storm. A face as vast as the sky itself. Whatever the thing wasspren, Herald, or god it had not tempered its storms for Kaladin during that day he'd spent strung up. "We are needed, Kaladin," Syl said softly. She waved for him, and he lowered his hand to the shore of the tiny violet ocean glowing softly in the chasm. She stepped onto his hand, and he stood up, lifting her. She walked up his fingers and he could actually feel a little weight, which was unusual. He turned his hand as she stepped up until she was perched on one finger, her hands clasped behind her back, meeting his eyes as he held that finger up before his face. "You," Syl said. "You're going to need to become what Dalinar Kholin is looking for. Don't let him search in vain." "They'll take it from me, Syl," Kaladin whispered. "They'll find a way to take you from me." "That's foolishness. You know that it is." "I know it is, but I feel it isn't. They broke me, Syl. I'm not what you think I am. I'm no Radiant." "That's not what I saw," Syl said. "On the battlefield after Sadeas's betrayal, when men were trapped, abandoned. That day I saw a hero." He looked into her eyes. She had pupils, though they were created only from the differing shades of white and blue, like the rest of her. She glowed more softly than the weakest of spheres, but it was enough to light his finger. She smiled, seeming utterly confident in him. At least one of them was. "I'll try," Kaladin whispered. A promise. "Kaladin?" The voice was Rock's, with his distinctive Horneater accent. He pronounced the name "kalahdeen," instead of the normal "kaladin." Syl zipped off Kaladin's finger, becoming a ribbon of light and flitting over to Rock. He showed respect to her in his Horneater way, touching his shoulders in turn with one hand, and then raising the hand to his forehead. She giggled; her profound solemnity had become girlish joy in moments. Syl might only be a cousin to windspren, but she obviously shared their impish nature. "Hey," Kaladin said, nodding to Rock, and fishing in the pool. He came out with an amethyst broam and held it up. Somewhere up there on the Plains, a lighteyes had died with this in his pocket. "Riches, if we still were bridgemen." "We are still bridgemen," Rock said, coming over. He plucked the sphere from Kaladin's fingers. "And this is still riches. Ha! Spices they have for us to requisition are tuma'alki! I have promised I will not fix dung for the men, but it is hard, with soldiers being accustomed to food that is not much better." He held up the sphere. "I will use him to buy better, eh?" "Sure," Kaladin said. Syl landed on Rock's shoulder and became a young woman, then sat down. Rock eyed her and tried to bow to his own shoulder. "Stop tormenting him, Syl," Kaladin said. "It's so fun!" "You are to be praised for your aid of us, mafah'liki," Rock said to her. "I will endure whatever you wish of me. And now that I am free, I can create a shrine fitting to you." "A shrine?" Syl said, eyes widening. "Ooooh." "Syl!" Kaladin said. "Stop it. Rock, I saw a good place for the men to practice. It's back a couple of branches. I marked it on the walls." "Yes, we saw this thing," Rock said. "Teft has led the men there. It is strange. This place is frightening; it is a place that nobody comes, and yet the new recruits . . ." "They're opening up," Kaladin guessed. "Yes. How did you know this thing would happen?" "They were there," Kaladin said, "in Sadeas's warcamp, when we were assigned to exclusive duty in the chasms. They saw what we did, and have heard stories of our training here. By bringing them down here, we're inviting them in, like an initiation." Teft had been having problems getting the former bridgemen to show interest in his training. The old soldier was always sputtering at them in annoyance. They'd insisted on remaining with Kaladin rather than going free, so why wouldn't they learn? They had needed to be invited. Not just with words. "Yes, well," Rock said. "Sigzil sent me. He wishes to know if you are ready to practice your abilities." Kaladin took a deep breath, glancing at Syl, then nodded. "Yes. Bring him. We can do it here." "Ha! Finally. I will fetch him." SIX YEARS AGO The world ended, and Shallan was to blame. "Pretend it never happened," her father whispered. He wiped something wet from her cheek. His thumb came back red. "I'll protect you." Was the room shaking? No, that was Shallan. Trembling. She felt so small. Eleven had seemed old to her, once. But she was a child, still a child. So small. She looked up at her father with a shudder. She couldn't blink; her eyes were frozen open. Father started to whisper, blinking tears. "Now go to sleep in chasms deep, with darkness all around you . . ." A familiar lullaby, one he always used to sing to her. In the room behind him, dark corpses stretched out on the floor. A red carpet once white. "Though rock and dread may be your bed, so sleep my baby dear." Father gathered her into his arms, and she felt her skin squirming. No. No, this affection wasn't right. A monster should not be held in love. A monster who killed, who murdered. No. She could not move. "Now comes the storm, but you'll be warm, the wind will rock your basket . . ." Father carried Shallan over the body of a woman in white. Little blood there. It was the man who bled. Mother lay facedown, so Shallan couldn't see the eyes. The horrible eyes. Almost, Shallan could imagine that the lullaby was the end to a nightmare. That it was night, that she had awakened screaming, and her father was singing her to sleep . . . "The crystals fine will glow sublime, so sleep my baby dear." They passed Father's strongbox set into the wall. It glowed brightly, light streaming from the cracks around the closed door. A monster was inside. "And with a song, it won't be long, you'll sleep my baby dear." With Shallan in his arms, Father left the room and closed the door on the corpses. But, understandably, we were focused on Sadeas. His betrayal was still fresh, and I saw its signs each day as I passed empty barracks and grieving widows. We knew that Sadeas would not simply rest upon his slaughters in pride. More was coming. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesach 1174 Shallan awoke mostly dry, lying on an uneven rock that rose from the ocean. Waves lapped at her toes, though she could barely feel them through the numbness. She groaned, lifting her cheek from the wet granite. There was land nearby, and the surf sounded against it with a low roar. In the other direction stretched only the endless blue sea. She was cold and her head throbbed as if she'd banged it repeatedly against a wall, but she was alive. Somehow. She raised her handrubbing at the itchy dried salt on her foreheadand hacked out a ragged cough. Her hair stuck to the sides of her face, and her dress was stained from the water and the seaweed on the rock. How . . . ? Then she saw it, a large brown shell in the water, almost invisible as it moved toward the horizon. The santhid. She stumbled to her feet, clinging to the pointy tip of her rock perch. Woozy, she watched the creature until it was gone. Something hummed beside her. Pattern formed his usual shape on the surface of the churning sea, translucent as if he were a small wave himself. "Did . . ." She coughed, clearing her voice, then groaned and sat down on the rock. "Did anyone else make it?" "Make?" Pattern asked. "Other people. The sailors. Did they escape?" "Uncertain," Pattern said, in his humming voice. "Ship . . . Gone. Splashing. Nothing seen." "The santhid. It rescued me." How had it known what to do? Were they intelligent? Could she have somehow communicated with it? Had she missed an opportunity to She almost started laughing as she realized the direction her thoughts were going. She'd nearly drowned, Jasnah was dead, the crew of the Wind's Pleasure likely murdered or swallowed by the sea! Instead of mourning them or marveling at her survival, Shallan was engaging in scholarly speculation? That's what you do, a deeply buried part of herself accused her. You distract yourself. You refuse to think about things that bother you. But that was how she survived. Shallan wrapped her arms around herself for warmth on her stone perch and stared out over the ocean. She had to face the truth. Jasnah was dead. Jasnah was dead. Shallan felt like weeping. A woman so brilliant, so amazing, was just . . . gone. Jasnah had been trying to save everyone, protect the world itself. And they'd killed her for it. The suddenness of what had happened left Shallan stunned, and so she sat there, shivering and cold and just staring out at the ocean. Her mind felt as numb as her feet. Shelter. She'd need shelter . . . something. Thoughts of the sailors, of Jasnah's research, those were of less immediate concern. Shallan was stranded on a stretch of coast that was almost completely uninhabited, in lands that froze at night. As she'd been sitting, the tide had slowly withdrawn, and the gap between herself and the shore was not nearly as wide as it had been. That was fortunate, as she couldn't really swim. She forced herself to move, though lifting her limbs was like trying to budge fallen tree trunks. She gritted her teeth and slipped into the water. She could still feel its biting cold. Not completely numb, then. "Shallan?" Pattern asked. "We can't sit out here forever," Shallan said, clinging to the rock and getting all the way down into the water. Her feet brushed rock beneath, and so she dared let go, half swimming in a splashing mess as she made her way toward the land. She probably swallowed half the water in the bay as she fought through the frigid waves until she finally was able to walk. Dress and hair streaming, she coughed and stumbled up onto the sandy shore, then fell to her knees. The ground here was strewn with seaweed of a dozen different varieties that writhed beneath her feet, pulling away, slimy and slippery. Cremlings and larger crabs scuttled in every direction, some nearby making clicking sounds at her, as if to ward her off. She dully thought it a testament to her exhaustion that she hadn't even consideredbefore leaving the rockthe sea predators she'd read about: a dozen different kinds of large crustaceans that were happy to have a leg to snip free and chew on. Fearspren suddenly began to wiggle out of the sand, purple and sluglike. That was silly. Now she was frightened? After her swim? The spren soon vanished. Shallan glanced back at her rock perch. The santhid probably hadn't been able to deposit her any closer, as the water grew too shallow. Stormfather. She was lucky to be alive. Despite her mounting anxiety, Shallan knelt down and traced a glyphward into the sand in prayer. She didn't have a means of burning it. For now, she had to assume the Almighty would accept this. She bowed her head and sat reverently for ten heartbeats. Then she stood and, hope against hope, began to search for other survivors. This stretch of coast was pocketed with numerous beaches and inlets. She put off seeking shelter, instead walking for a long time down the shoreline. The beach was composed of sand that was coarser than she'd expected. It certainly didn't match the idyllic stories she'd read, and it ground unpleasantly against her toes as she walked. Alongside her, it rose in a moving shape as Pattern kept pace with her, humming anxiously. Shallan passed branches, even bits of wood that might have belonged to ships. She saw no people and found no footprints. As the day grew long, she gave up, sitting down on a weathered stone. She hadn't noticed that her feet were sliced and reddened from walking on the rocks. Her hair was a complete mess. Her safepouch had a few spheres in it, but none were infused. They'd be of no use unless she found civilization. Firewood, she thought. She'd gather that and build a fire. In the night, that might signal other survivors. Or it might signal pirates, bandits, or the shipboard assassins, if they had survived. Shallan grimaced. What was she going to do? Build a small fire to keep warm, she decided. Shield it, then watch the night for other fires. If you see one, try to inspect it without getting too close. A fine plan, except for the fact that she'd lived her entire life in a stately manor, with servants to light fires for her. She'd never started one in a hearth, let alone in the wilderness. Storms . . . she'd be lucky not to die of exposure out here. Or starvation. What would she do when a highstorm came? When was the next one? Tomorrow night? Or was it the night after. "Come!" Pattern said. He vibrated in the sand. Grains jumped and shook as he spoke, rising and falling around him. I recognize that . . . Shallan thought, frowning at him. Sand on a plate. Kabsal . . . "Come!" Pattern repeated, more urgent. "What?" Shallan said, standing up. Storms, but she was tired. She could barely move. "Did you find someone?" "Yes!" That got her attention immediately. She didn't ask further questions, but instead followed Pattern, who moved excitedly down the coast. Would he know the difference between someone dangerous and someone friendly? For the moment, cold and exhausted, she almost didn't care. He stopped beside something halfway submerged in the water and seaweed at the edge of the ocean. Shallan frowned. A trunk. Not a person, but a large wooden trunk. Shallan's breath caught in her throat, and she dropped to her knees, working the clasps and pulling open the lid. Inside, like a glowing treasure, were Jasnah's books and notes, carefully packed away, protected in their waterproof enclosure. Jasnah might not have survived, but her life's work had. * * * Shallan knelt down by her improvised firepit. A grouping of rocks, filled with sticks she'd gathered from this little stand of trees. Night was almost upon her. With it came the shocking cold, as bad as the worst winter back home. Here in the Frostlands, this would be common. Her clothing, which in this humidity hadn't completely dried despite the hours walking, felt like ice. She did not know how to build a fire, but perhaps she could make one in another way. She fought through her wearinessstorms, but she was exhausted and took out a glowing sphere, one of many she'd found in Jasnah's trunk. "All right," she whispered. "Let's do this." Shadesmar. "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. She was learning to interpret his humming. This seemed anxious. "Dangerous." "Why?" "What is land here is sea there." Shallan nodded dully. Wait. Think. That was growing hard, but she forced herself to go over Pattern's words again. When they'd sailed the ocean, and she'd visited Shadesmar, she'd found obsidian ground beneath her. But in Kharbranth, she'd dropped into that ocean of spheres. "So what do we do?" Shallan asked. "Go slowly." Shallan took a deep, cold breath, then nodded. She tried as she had before. Slowly, carefully. It was like . . . like opening her eyes in the morning. Awareness of another place consumed her. The nearby trees popped like bubbles, beads forming in their place and dropping toward a shifting sea of them below. Shallan felt herself falling. She gasped, then blinked back that awareness, closing her metaphoric eyes. That place vanished, and in a moment, she was back in the stand of trees. Pattern hummed nervously. Shallan set her jaw and tried again. More slowly this time, slipping into that place with its strange sky and notsun. For a moment, she hovered between the worlds, Shadesmar overlaying the world around her like a shadowy afterimage. Holding between the two was difficult. Use the Light, Pattern said. Bring them. Shallan hesitantly drew the Light into herself. The spheres in the ocean below moved like a school of fish, surging toward her, clinking together. In her exhaustion, Shallan could barely maintain her double state, and she grew woozy, looking down. She held on, somehow. Pattern stood beside her, in his form with the stiff clothing and a head made of impossible lines, arms clasped behind his back, and hovering as if in the air. He was tall and imposing on this side, and she absently noticed that he cast a shadow the wrong way, toward the distant, coldseeming sun instead of away from it. "Good," he said, his voice a deeper hum here. "Good." He cocked his head, and though he had no eyes, turned around as if regarding the place. "I am from here, yet I remember so little . . ." Shallan had a sense that her time was limited. Kneeling, she reached down and felt at the sticks she'd piled to form the place for her fire. She could feel the sticksbut as she looked into this strange realm, her fingers also found one of the glass beads that had surged up beneath her. As she touched it, she noticed something sweeping through the air above her. She cringed, looking up to find large, birdlike creatures circling around her in Shadesmar. They were a dark grey and seemed to have no specific shape, their forms blurry. "What . . ." "Spren," Pattern said. "Drawn by you. Your . . . tiredness?" "Exhaustionspren?" she asked, shocked by their size here. "Yes." She shivered, then looked down at the sphere beneath her hand. She was dangerously close to falling into Shadesmar completely, and could barely see the impressions of the physical realm around her. Only those beads. She felt as if she would tumble into their sea at any moment. "Please," Shallan said to the sphere. "I need you to become fire." Pattern buzzed, speaking with a new voice, interpreting the sphere's words. "I am a stick," he said. He sounded satisfied. "You could be fire," Shallan said. "I am a stick." The stick was not particularly eloquent. She supposed that she shouldn't be surprised. "Why don't you become fire instead?" "I am a stick." "How do I make it change?" Shallan asked of Pattern. "Mm . . . I do not know. You must persuade it. Offer it truths, I think?" He sounded agitated. "This place is dangerous for you. For us. Please. Speed." She looked back at the stick. "You want to burn." "I am a stick." "Think how much fun it would be?" "I am a stick." "Stormlight," Shallan said. "You could have it! All that I'm holding." A pause. Finally, "I am a stick." "Sticks need Stormlight. For . . . things . . ." Shallan blinked away tears of fatigue. "I am" "a stick," Shallan said. She gripped the sphere, feeling both it and the stick in the physical realm, trying to think through another argument. For a moment, she hadn't felt quite so tired, but it was returningcrashing back upon her. Why . . . Her Stormlight was running out. It was gone in a moment, drained from her, and she exhaled, slipping into Shadesmar with a sigh, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. She fell into the sea of spheres. That awful blackness, millions of moving bits, consuming her. She threw herself from Shadesmar. The spheres expanded outward, growing into sticks and rocks and trees, restoring the world as she knew it. She collapsed into her small stand of trees, heart pounding. All grew normal around her. No more distant sun, no more sea of spheres. Just frigid cold, a night sky, and biting wind that blew between the trees. The single sphere she'd drained slipped from her fingers, clicking against the stone ground. She leaned back against Jasnah's trunk. Her arms still ached from dragging that up the beach to the trees. She huddled there, frightened. "Do you know how to make fire?" she asked Pattern. Her teeth chattered. Stormfather. She didn't feel cold anymore, but her teeth were chattering, and her breath was visible as vapor in the starlight. She found herself growing drowsy. Maybe she should just sleep, then try to deal with it all in the morning. "Change?" Pattern asked. "Offer the change." "I tried." "I know." His vibrations sounded depressed. Shallan stared at that pile of sticks, feeling utterly useless. What was it Jasnah had said? Control is the basis of all true power? Authority and strength are matters of perception? Well, this was a direct refutation of that. Shallan could imagine herself as grand, could act like a queen, but that didn't change a thing out here in the wilderness. Well, Shallan thought, I'm not going to sit here and freeze to death. I'll at least freeze to death trying to find help. She didn't move, though. Moving was hard. At least here, huddled by the trunk, she didn't have to feel the wind so much. Just lying here until morning . . . She curled into a ball. No. This didn't seem right. She coughed, then somehow got to her feet. She stumbled away from her notfire, dug a sphere from her safepouch, then started walking. Pattern moved at her feet. Those were bloodier now. She left a red trail on the rock. She couldn't feel the cuts. She walked and walked. And walked. And . . . Light. She didn't move any more quickly. She couldn't. But she did keep going, shambling directly toward that pinprick in the darkness. A numb part of her worried that the light was really Nomon, the second moon. That she'd march toward it and fall off the edge of Roshar itself. So she surprised herself by stumbling right into the middle of a small group of people sitting around a campfire. She blinked, looking from one face to another; thenignoring the sounds they made, for words were meaningless to her in this stateshe walked to the campfire and lay down, curled up, and fell asleep. * * * "Brightness?" Shallan grumbled, rolling over. Her face hurt. No, her feet hurt. Her face was nothing compared to that pain. If she slept a little longer, maybe it would fade. At least for that time. . . . "BBrightness?" the voice asked again. "Are you feeling well, yes?" That was a Thaylen accent. Dredged from deep within her, a light surfaced, bringing memories. The ship. Thaylens. The sailors? Shallan forced her eyes open. The air smelled faintly of smoke from the stillsmoldering fire. The sky was a deep violet, brightening as the sun broke the horizon. She'd slept on hard rock, and her body ached. She didn't recognize the speaker, a portly Thaylen man with a white beard wearing a knit cap and an old suit and vest, patched in a few inconspicuous places. He wore his white Thaylen eyebrows tucked up over his ears. Not a sailor. A merchant. Shallan stifled a groan, sitting up. Then, in a moment of panic, she checked her safehand. One of her fingers had slipped out of the sleeve, and she pulled it back in. The Thaylen's eyes flicked toward it, but he said nothing. "You are well, then?" the man asked. He spoke in Alethi. "We were going to pack to go, you see. Your arrival last night was . . . unexpected. We did not wish to disturb you, but thought perhaps you would want to wake before we depart." Shallan ran her freehand through her hair, a mess of red locks stuck with twigs. Two other mentall, hulking, and of Vorin descentpacked up blankets and bedrolls. She'd have killed for one of those during the night. She remembered tossing uncomfortably. Stilling the needs of nature, she turned and was surprised to see three large chull wagons with cages on the back. Inside were a handful of dirty, shirtless men. It took just a moment for it all to click. Slavers. She shoved down an initial burst of panic. Slaving was a perfectly legal profession. Most of the time. Only this was the Frostlands, far from the rule of any group or nation. Who was to say what was legal here and what was not? Be calm, she told herself forcefully. They wouldn't have awakened you politely if they were planning something like that. Selling a Vorin woman of high dahnwhich the dress marked her as being would be a risky gambit for a slaver. Most owners in civilized lands would require documentation of the slave's past, and it was rare indeed that a lighteyes was made a slave, aside from ardents. Usually someone of higher breeding would simply be executed instead. Slavery was a mercy for the lower classes. "Brightness?" the slaver asked nervously. She was thinking like a scholar again, to distract herself. She'd need to get past that. "What is your name?" Shallan asked. She hadn't intended to make her voice quite so emotionless, but the shock of what she'd seen left her in turmoil. The man stepped back at her tone. "I am Tvlakv, humble merchant." "Slaver," Shallan said, standing up and pushing her hair back from her face. "As I said. A merchant." His two guards watched her as they loaded equipment onto the lead wagon. She did not miss the cudgels they carried prominently at their waists. She'd had a sphere in her hand as she walked last night, hadn't she? Memories of that made her feet flare up again. She had to grit her teeth against the agony as painspren, like orange hands made of sinew, clawed out of the ground nearby. She'd need to clean her wounds, but bloodied and bruised as they were, she wasn't going to be walking anywhere anytime soon. Those wagons had seats. . . . They likely stole the sphere from me, she thought. She felt around in her safepouch. The other spheres were still there, but the the sleeve was unbuttoned. Had she done that? Had they peeked? She couldn't suppress a blush at the thought. The two guards regarded her hungrily. Tvlakv acted humble, but his leering eyes were also very eager. These men were one step from robbing her. But if she left them, she'd probably die out here, alone. Stormfather! What could she do? She felt like sitting down and sobbing. After everything that had happened, now this? Control is the basis of all power. How would Jasnah respond to this situation? The answer was simple. She would be Jasnah. "I will allow you to assist me," Shallan said. She somehow kept her voice even, despite the anxious terror she felt inside. ". . . Brightness?" Tvlakv asked. "As you can see," Shallan said, "I am the victim of a shipwreck. My servants are lost to me. You and your men will do. I have a trunk. We will need to go fetch it." She felt like one of the ten fools. Surely he would see through the flimsy act. Pretending you had authority was not the same as having it, no matter what Jasnah said. "It would . . . of course be our privilege to help," Tvlakv said. "Brightness . . . ?" "Davar," Shallan said, though she took care to soften her voice. Jasnah wasn't condescending. Where other lighteyes, like Shallan's father, went about with conceited egotism, Jasnah had simply expected people to do as she wished. And they had. She could make this work. She had to. "Tradesman Tvlakv," Shallan said. "I will need to go to the Shattered Plains. Do you know the way?" "The Shattered Plains?" the man asked, glancing at his guards, one of whom had approached. "We were there a few months ago, but are now heading to catch a barge over to Thaylenah. We have completed our trading in this area, with no need to return northward." "Ah, but you do have a need to return," Shallan said, walking toward one of the wagons. Each step was agony. "To take me." She glanced around, and gratefully noticed Pattern on the side of a wagon, watching. She walked to the front of that wagon, then held out her hand to the other guard, who stood nearby. He looked at the hand mutely, scratching his head. Then he looked at the wagon and climbed onto it, reaching down to help her up. Tvlakv walked over to her. "It will be an expensive trip for us to return without wares! I have only these slaves I purchased at the Shallow Crypts. Not enough to justify the trip back, not yet." "Expensive?" Shallan asked, seating herself, trying to project amusement. "I assure you, tradesman Tvlakv, the expense is minuscule to me. You will be greatly compensated. Now, let us be moving. There are important people waiting for me at the Shattered Plains." "But Brightness," Tvlakv said. "You've obviously had a difficult time of events recently, yes, that I can see. Let me take you to the Shallow Crypts. It is much closer. You can find rest there and send word to those waiting for you." "Did I ask to be taken to the Shallow Crypts?" "But . . ." He trailed off as she focused her gaze on him. She softened her expression. "I know what I am doing, and thank you for the advice. Now let us be moving." The three men exchanged befuddled looks, and the slaver took his knit cap off, wringing it in his hands. Nearby, a pair of parshmen with marbled skin walked into camp. Shallan nearly jumped as they trudged by, carrying dried rockbud shells they'd apparently been gathering for fires. Tvlakv gave them no heed. Parshmen. Voidbringers. Her skin crawled, but she couldn't worry about them right now. She looked back at the slaver, expecting him to ignore her orders. However, he nodded. And then, he and his men simply . . . did as she said. They hitched up the chulls, the slaver got directions to her trunk, and they started moving without further objection. They might just be going along for now, Shallan told herself, because they want to know what's in my trunk. More to rob. But when they reached it, they heaved it onto the wagon, lashed it in place, and then turned around and headed to the north. Toward the Shattered Plains. Unfortunately, we fixated upon Sadeas's plotting so much that we did not take note of the changed pattern of our enemies, the murderers of my husband, the true danger. I would like to know what wind brought about their sudden, inexplicable transformation. From the journal of Navani Kholin, Jesesach 1174 Kaladin pressed the stone against the wall of the chasm, and it stuck there. "All right," he said, stepping back. Rock jumped up and grabbed it, then dangled from the wall, bending legs below. His deep, bellowing laugh echoed in the chasm. "This time, he holds me!" Sigzil made a notation on his ledger. "Good. Keep hanging on, Rock." "For how long?" Rock asked. "Until you fall." "Until I . . ." The large Horneater frowned, hanging from the stone with both hands. "I do not like this experiment any longer." "Oh, don't whine," Kaladin said, folding his arms and leaning on the wall beside Rock. Spheres lit the chasm floor around them, with its vines, debris, and blooming plants. "You're not dropping far." "It is not the drop," Rock complained. "It is my arms. I am big man, you see." "So it's a good thing you have big arms to hold you." "It does not work that way, I think," Rock said, grunting. "And the handhold is not good. And I" The stone popped free and Rock fell downward. Kaladin grabbed his arm, steadying him as he caught himself. "Twenty seconds," Sigzil said. "Not very long." "I warned you," Kaladin said, picking up the fallen stone. "It lasts longer if I use more Stormlight." "I think we need a baseline," Sigzil said. He fished in his pocket and pulled out a glowing diamond chip, the smallest denomination of sphere. "Take all of the Stormlight from this, put it into the stone, then we'll hang Rock from that and see how long he takes to fall." Rock groaned. "My poor arms . . ." "Hey, mancha," Lopen called from farther down the chasm, "at least you've got two of them, eh?" The Herdazian was watching to make sure none of the new recruits somehow wandered over and saw what Kaladin was doing. It shouldn't happenthey were practicing several chasms overbut Kaladin wanted someone on guard. Eventually they'll all know anyway, Kaladin thought, taking the chip from Sigzil. Isn't that what you just promised Syl? That you'd let yourself become a Radiant? Kaladin drew in the chip's Stormlight with a sharp intake of breath, then infused the Light into the stone. He was getting better at that, drawing the Stormlight into his hand, then using it like luminescent paint to coat the bottom of the rock. The Stormlight soaked into the stone, and when he pressed it against the wall, it stayed there. Smoky tendrils of luminescence rose from the stone. "We probably don't need to make Rock hang from it," Kaladin said. "If you need a baseline, why not just use how long the stone remains there on its own?" "Well, that's less fun," Sigzil said. "But very well." He continued to write numbers on his ledger. That would have made most of the other bridgemen uncomfortable. A man writing was seen as unmasculine, even blasphemous though Sigzil was only writing glyphs. Today, fortunately, Kaladin had with him Sigzil, Rock, and Lopenall foreigners from places with different rules. Herdaz was Vorin, technically, but they had their own brand of it and Lopen didn't seem to mind a man writing. "So," Rock said as they waited, "Stormblessed leader, you said there was something else you could do, did you not?" "Fly!" Lopen said from down the passage. "I can't fly," Kaladin said dryly. "Walk on walls!" "I tried that," Kaladin said. "I nearly broke my head from the fall." "Ah, gancho," Lopen said. "No flying or walking on walls? I need to impress the women. I do not think sticking rocks to walls will be enough." "I think anyone would find that impressive," Sigzil said. "It defies the laws of nature." "You do not know many Herdazian women, do you?" Lopen asked, sighing. "Really, I think we should try again on the flying. It would be the best." "There is something more," Kaladin said. "Not flying, but still useful. I'm not certain I can replicate it. I've never done it consciously." "The shield," Rock said, standing by the wall, staring up at the rock. "On the battlefield, when the Parshendi shot at us. The arrows hit your shield. All the arrows." "Yes," Kaladin said. "We should test that," Sigzil said. "We'll need a bow." "Spren," Rock said, pointing. "They pull the stone against the wall." "What?" Sigzil said, scrambling over, squinting at the rock Kaladin had pressed against the wall. "I don't see them." "Ah," Rock said. "Then they do not wish to be seen." He bowed his head toward them. "Apologies, mafah'liki." Sigzil frowned, looking closer, holding up a sphere to light the area. Kaladin walked over and joined them. He could make out the tiny purple spren if he looked closely. "They're there, Sig," Kaladin said. "Then why can't I see them?" "It has to do with my abilities," Kaladin said, glancing at Syl, who sat on a cleft in the rock nearby, one leg draping over and swinging. "But Rock" "I am alaii'iku," Rock said, raising a hand to his breast. "Which means?" Sigzil asked impatiently. "That I can see these spren, and you cannot." Rock rested a hand on the smaller man's shoulder. "It is all right, friend. I do not blame you for being blind. Most lowlanders are. It is the air, you see. Makes your brains stop working right." Sigzil frowned, but wrote down some notes while absently doing something with his fingers. Keeping track of the seconds? The rock finally popped off the wall, trailing a few final wisps of Stormlight as it hit the ground. "Well over a minute," Sigzil said. "I counted eightyseven seconds." He looked to the rest of them. "We were supposed to be counting?" Kaladin asked, glancing at Rock, who shrugged. Sigzil sighed. "Ninetyone seconds," Lopen called. "You're welcome." Sigzil sat down on a rock, ignoring a few finger bones peeking out of the moss beside him, and made some notations on his ledger. He scowled. "Ha!" Rock said, squatting down beside him. "You look like you have eaten bad eggs. What is problem?" "I don't know what I'm doing, Rock," Sigzil said. "My master taught me to ask questions and find precise answers. But how can I be precise? I would need a clock for the timing, but they are too expensive. Even if we had one, I don't know how to measure Stormlight!" "With chips," Kaladin said. "The gemstones are precisely weighed before being encased in glass." "And can they all hold the same amount?" Sigzil asked. "We know that uncut gems hold less than cut ones. So is one that was cut better going to hold more? Plus, Stormlight fades from a sphere over time. How many days has it been since that chip was infused, and how much Light has it lost since then? Do they all lose the same amount at the same rate? We know too little. I think perhaps I am wasting your time, sir." "It's not a waste," Lopen said, joining them. The onearmed Herdazian yawned, sitting down on the rock by Sigzil, forcing the other man over a little. "We just need to be testing other things, eh?" "Like what?" Kaladin said. "Well, gancho," Lopen said. "Can you stick me to the wall?" "I . . . I don't know," Kaladin said. "Seems like it would be good to know, eh?" Lopen stood up. "Shall we try?" Kaladin glanced at Sigzil, who shrugged. Kaladin drew in more Stormlight. The raging tempest filled him, as if it were battering against his skin, a captive trying to find a way out. He drew the Stormlight into his hand and pressed it against the wall, painting the stones with luminescence. Taking a deep breath, he picked up Lopenthe slender man was startlingly easy to lift, particularly with a measure of Stormlight still inside Kaladin's veins. He pressed Lopen against the wall. When Kaladin dubiously stepped back, the Herdazian remained there, stuck to the stone by his uniform, which bunched up under his armpits. Lopen grinned. "It worked!" "This thing could be useful," Rock said, rubbing at his strangely cut Horneater beard. "Yes, this is what we need to test. You are a soldier, Kaladin. Can you use this in combat?" Kaladin nodded slowly, a dozen possibilities popping into his head. What if his enemies ran across a pool of Light he had put on the floor? Could he stop a wagon from rolling? Stick his spear to an enemy shield, then yank it from their hands? "How does it feel, Lopen?" Rock asked. "Does this thing hurt?" "Nah," Lopen said, wiggling. "I'm worried my coat will rip, or the buttons will snap. Oh. Oh. Question for you! What did the onearmed Herdazian do to the man who stuck him to the wall?" Kaladin frowned. "I . . . I don't know." "Nothing," Lopen said. "The Herdazian was 'armless." The slender man burst into laughter. Sigzil groaned, though Rock laughed. Syl had cocked her head, zipping over to Kaladin. "Was that a joke?" she asked softly. "Yes," Kaladin said. "A distinctly bad one." "Ah, don't say that!" Lopen said, still chuckling. "It's the best one I know and trust me, I'm an expert on onearmed Herdazian jokes. 'Lopen,' my mother always says, 'you must learn these to laugh before others do. Then you steal the laughter from them, and have it all for yourself.' She is a very wise woman. I once brought her the head of a chull." Kaladin blinked. "You . . . What?" "Chull head," Lopen said. "Very good to eat." "You are a strange man, Lopen," Kaladin said. "No," Rock said. "They really are good. The head, he is best part of chull." "I will trust you two on that," Kaladin said. "Marginally." He reached up, taking Lopen by the arm as the Stormlight holding him in place began to fade. Rock grabbed the man's waist, and they helped him down. "All right," Kaladin said, instinctively checking the sky for the time, though he couldn't see the sun through the narrow chasm opening above. "Let's experiment." * * * Tempest stoked within him, Kaladin dashed across the chasm floor. His movement startled a group of frillblooms, which pulled in frantically, like hands closing. Vines trembled on the walls and began to curl upward. Kaladin's feet splashed in stagnant water. He leaped over a mound of debris, trailing Stormlight. He was filled with it, pounding with it. That made it easier to use; it wanted to flow. He pushed it into his spear. Ahead, Lopen, Rock, and Sigzil waited with practice spears. Though Lopen wasn't very goodthe missing arm was a huge disadvantageRock made up for it. The large Horneater would not fight Parshendi and would not kill, but had agreed to spar today, in the name of "experimentation." He fought very well, and Sigzil was acceptable with the spear. Together on the battlefield, the three bridgemen might once have given Kaladin trouble. Times changed. Kaladin tossed his spear sideways at Rock, surprising the Horneater, who had raised his weapon to block. The Stormlight made Kaladin's spear stick to Rock's, forming a cross. Rock cursed, trying to turn his spear around to strike, but in doing so smacked himself on the side with Kaladin's spear. As Lopen's spear struck, Kaladin pushed it down easily with one hand, filling the tip with Stormlight. The weapon hit the pile of refuse and stuck to the wood and bones. Sigzil's weapon came in, missing Kaladin's chest by a wide margin as he stepped aside. Kaladin nudged and infused the weapon with the flat of his hand, shoving it into Lopen's, which he'd just pulled out of the refuse, plastered with moss and bone. The two spears stuck together. Kaladin slipped between Rock and Sigzil, leaving the three of them in a jumbled mess, off balance and trying to disentangle their weapons. Kaladin smiled grimly, jogging down to the other end of the chasm. He picked up a spear, then turned, dancing from one foot to the other. The Stormlight encouraged him to move. Standing still was practically impossible while holding so much. Come on, come on, he thought. The three others finally got their weapons apart as the Stormlight ran out. They formed up to face him again. Kaladin dashed forward. In the dim light of the chasm, the glow of the smoke rising from him was strong enough to cast shadows that leaped and spun. He crashed through pools, the water cold on his unshod feet. He'd removed his boots; he wanted to feel the stone underneath him. This time, the three bridgemen set the butts of their spears on the ground as if against a charge. Kaladin smiled, then grabbed the top of his spearlike theirs, it was a practice one, without a real spearheadand infused it with Stormlight. He slapped it against Rock's, intending to yank it out of the Horneater's hands. Rock had other plans, and hauled his spear back with a strength that took Kaladin by surprise. He nearly lost his grip. Lopen and Sigzil quickly moved to come at him from either side. Nice, Kaladin thought, proud. He'd taught them formations like that, showing them how to work together on the battlefield. As they drew close, Kaladin let go of his spear and stuck out his leg. The Stormlight flowed out of his bare foot as easily as it did his hands, and he was able to swipe a large glowing arc on the ground. Sigzil stepped in it and tripped, his foot sticking to the Light. He tried to stab as he fell, but there was no force behind the blow. Kaladin slammed his weight against Lopen, whose strike was offcenter. He shoved Lopen against the wall, then pulled back, leaving the Herdazian stuck to the stone, which Kaladin had infused in the heartbeat they'd been pressed together. "Ah, not again," Lopen said with a groan. Sigzil had fallen facefirst in the water. Kaladin barely had time to smile before he noticed Rock swinging a log at his head. An entire log. How had Rock lifted that thing? Kaladin threw himself out of the way, rolling on the ground and scraping his hand as the log crashed against the floor of the chasm. Kaladin growled, Stormlight passing between his teeth and rising into the air in front of him. He jumped onto Rock's log as the Horneater tried to lift it again. Kaladin's landing slammed the wood back against the ground. He leaped toward Rock, and part of him wondered just what he was thinking, getting into a handtohand fight with someone twice his weight. He slammed into the Horneater, hurling them both to the ground. They rolled in the moss, Rock twisting to pin Kaladin's arms. The Horneater obviously had training as a wrestler. Kaladin poured Stormlight into the ground. It wouldn't affect or hamper him, he'd found. So, as they rolled, first Rock's arm stuck to the ground, then his side. The Horneater kept fighting to get Kaladin into a hold. He almost had it, till Kaladin pushed with his legs, rolling both of them so Rock's other elbow touched the ground, where it stuck. Kaladin tore away, gasping and puffing, losing most of his remaining Stormlight as he coughed. He leaned up against the wall, mopping sweat from his face. "Ha!" Rock said, stuck to the ground, splayed with arms to the sides. "I almost had you. Slippery as a fifth son, you are!" "Storms, Rock," Kaladin said. "What I wouldn't do to get you on the battlefield. You are wasted as a cook." "You don't like the food?" Rock asked, laughing. "I will have to try something with more grease. This thing will fit you! Grabbing you was like trying to keep my hands on a live lakefish! One that has been covered in butter! Ha!" Kaladin stepped up to him, squatting down. "You're a warrior, Rock. I saw it in Teft, and you can say whatever you want, but I see it in you." "I am wrong son to be soldier," Rock said stubbornly. "It is a thing of the tuanalikina, the fourth son or below. Third son cannot be wasted in battle." "Didn't stop you from throwing a tree at my head." "Was small tree," Rock said. "And very hard head." Kaladin smiled, then reached down, touching the Stormlight infused into the stone beneath Rock. He hadn't ever tried to take it back after using it in this way. Could he? He closed his eyes and breathed in, trying . . . yes. Some of the tempest within him stoked again. When he opened his eyes, Rock was free. Kaladin hadn't been able to take it all back, but some. The rest was evaporating into the air. He took Rock by the hand, helping the larger man to his feet. Rock dusted himself off. "That was embarrassing," Sigzil said as Kaladin walked over to free him too. "It's like we're children. The Prime's own eyes have not seen such a shameful show." "I have a very unfair advantage," Kaladin said, helping Sigzil to his feet. "Years of training as a soldier, a larger build than you. Oh, and the ability to emit Stormlight from my fingers." He patted Sigzil on the shoulder. "You did well. This is just a test, like you wanted." A more useful type of test, Kaladin thought. "Sure," Lopen said from behind them. "Just go ahead and leave the Herdazian stuck to the wall. The view here is wonderful. Oh, and is that slime running down my cheek? A fresh new look for the Lopen, who cannot brush it away, becausehave I mentioned?his hand is stuck to the wall." Kaladin smiled, walking over. "You were the one who asked me to stick you to a wall in the first place, Lopen." "My other hand?" Lopen said. "The one that was cut off long ago, eaten by a fearsome beast? It is making a rude gesture toward you right now. I thought you would wish to know, so that you can prepare to be insulted." He said it with the same lightheartedness with which he seemed to approach everything. He had even joined the bridge crew with a certain crazy eagerness. Kaladin let him down. "This thing," Rock said, "it worked well." "Yes," Kaladin said. Though honestly, he probably could have dispatched the three men more easily just by using a spear and the extra speed and strength the Stormlight lent. He didn't know yet whether that was because he was unfamiliar with these new powers, but he did think that forcing himself to use them had put him in some awkward positions. Familiarity, he thought. I need to know these abilities as well as I know my spear. That meant practice. Lots of practice. Unfortunately, the best way to practice was to find someone who matched or bested you in skill, strength, and capacity. Considering what he could now do, that was going to be a tall order. The three others walked over to dig waterskins from their packs, and Kaladin noticed a figure standing in the shadows a little ways down the chasm. Kaladin stood up, alarmed until Teft emerged into the light of their spheres. "I thought you were going to be on watch," Teft growled at Lopen. "Too busy being stuck to walls," Lopen said, raising his waterskin. "I thought you had a bunch of greenvines to train?" "Drehy has them in hand," Teft said, picking his way around some debris, joining Kaladin beside the chasm wall. "I don't know if the lads told you, Kaladin, but bringing that lot down here broke them out of their shells somehow." Kaladin nodded. "How did you get to know people so well?" Teft asked. "It involves a lot of cutting them apart," Kaladin said, looking down at his hand, which he'd scraped while fighting Rock. The scrape was gone, Stormlight having healed the tears in his skin. Teft grunted, glancing back at Rock and the other two, who had broken out rations. "You ought to put Rock in charge of the new recruits." "He won't fight." "He just sparred with you," Teft said. "So maybe he will with them. People like him more than me. I'm just going to screw this up." "You'll do a fine job, Teft, I won't have you saying otherwise. We have resources now. No more scrimping for every last sphere. You'll train those lads, and you'll do it right." Teft sighed, but said no more. "You saw what I did." "Aye," Teft said. "We'll need to bring down the entire group of twenty if we want to give you a proper challenge." "That or find another person like myself," Kaladin said. "Someone to spar with." "Aye," Teft said again, nodding, as if he hadn't considered that. "There were ten orders of knights, right?" Kaladin asked. "Do you know much of the others?" Teft had been the first one to figure out what Kaladin could do. He'd known before Kaladin himself had. "Not much," Teft said with a grimace. "I know the orders didn't always get along, despite what the official stories say. We'll need to see if we can find someone who knows more than I do. I . . . I kept away. And the people I knew who could tell us, they aren't around any longer." If Teft had been in a dour mood before, this drove him down even further. He looked at the ground. He spoke of his past infrequently, but Kaladin was more and more certain that whoever these people had been, they were dead because of something Teft himself had done. "What would you think if you heard that somebody wanted to refound the Knights Radiant?" Kaladin said softly to Teft. Teft looked up sharply. "You" "Not me," Kaladin said, speaking carefully. Dalinar Kholin had let him listen in on the conference, and while Kaladin trusted Teft, there were certain expectations of silence that an officer was required to uphold. Dalinar is a lighteyes, part of him whispered. He wouldn't think twice if he were revealing a secret you'd shared with him. "Not me," Kaladin repeated. "What if a king somewhere decided he wanted to gather a group of people and name them Knights Radiant?" "I'd call him an idiot," Teft said. "Now, the Radiants weren't what people say. They weren't traitors. They just weren't. But everyone is sure they betrayed us, and you're not going to change minds quickly. Not unless you can Surgebind to quiet them." Teft looked Kaladin up and down. "Are you going to do it, lad?" "They'd hate me, wouldn't they?" Kaladin said. He couldn't help noticing Syl, who walked through the air until she was close, studying him. "For what the old Radiants did." He held up a hand to stop Teft's objection. "What people think they did." "Aye," Teft said. Syl folded her arms, giving Kaladin a look. You promised, that look said. "We'll have to be careful about how we do it, then," Kaladin said. "Go gather the new recruits. They've had enough practice down here for one day." Teft nodded, then jogged off to do as ordered. Kaladin gathered his spear and the spheres he'd set out to light the sparring, then waved to the other three. They packed up their things and began the hike back out. "So you're going to do it," Syl said, landing on his shoulder. "I want to practice more first," Kaladin said. And get used to the idea. "It will be fine, Kaladin." "No. It will be hard. People will hate me, and even if they don't, I'll be set apart from them. Separated. I've accepted that as my lot, though. I'll deal with it." Even in Bridge Four, Moash was the only one who didn't treat Kaladin like some mythological savior Herald. Him and maybe Rock. Still, the other bridgemen hadn't reacted with the fear he'd once worried about. They might idolize him, but they did not isolate him. It was good enough. They reached the rope ladder before Teft and the greenvines, but there was no reason to wait. Kaladin climbed up out of the muggy chasm onto the plateau just east of the warcamps. It felt so strange to be able to carry his spear and money out of the chasm. Indeed, the soldiers guarding the approach to Dalinar's warcamp didn't pester himinstead, they saluted and stood up straight. It was as crisp a salute as he'd ever gotten, as crisp as the ones given to a general. "They seem proud of you," Syl said. "They don't even know you, but they're proud of you." "They're darkeyes," Kaladin said, saluting back. "Probably men who were fighting on the Tower when Sadeas betrayed them." "Stormblessed," one of them called. "Have you heard the news?" Curse the one who told them that nickname, Kaladin thought as Rock and the other two caught up to him. "No," Kaladin called. "What news?" "A hero has come to the Shattered Plains!" the soldier yelled back. "He's going to meet with Brightlord Kholin, perhaps support him! It's a good sign. Might help calm things down around here." "What's this?" Rock called back. "Who?" The soldier said a name. Kaladin's heart became ice. He nearly lost his spear from numb fingers. And then, he took off running. He didn't heed Rock's cry behind him, didn't stop to let the others catch up with him. He dashed through the camp, running toward Dalinar's command complex at its center. He didn't want to believe when he saw the banner hanging in the air above a group of soldiers, probably matched by a much larger group outside the warcamp. Kaladin passed them, drawing cries and stares, questions if something was wrong. He finally stumbled to a stop outside the short set of steps into Dalinar's bunkered complex of stone buildings. There, standing in front, the Blackthorn clasped hands with a tall man. Squarefaced and dignified, the newcomer wore a pristine uniform. He laughed, then embraced Dalinar. "Old friend," he said. "It's been too long." "Too long by far," Dalinar agreed. "I'm glad you finally made your way here, after years of promises. I heard you've even found yourself a Shardblade!" "Yes," the newcomer said, pulling back and holding his hand to the side. "Taken from an assassin who dared try to kill me on the field of battle." The Blade appeared. Kaladin stared at the silvery weapon. Etched along its length, the Blade was shaped to look like flames in motion, and to Kaladin it seemed that the weapon was stained red. Names flooded his mind: Dallet, Coreb, Reesh . . . a squad before time, from another life. Men Kaladin had loved. He looked up and forced himself to see the face of the newcomer. A man Kaladin hated, hated beyond any other. A man he had once worshipped. Highlord Amaram. The man who had stolen Kaladin's Shardblade, branded his forehead, and sold him into slavery. THE END OF Part One The Rhythm of Resolve thrummed softly in the back of Eshonai's mind as she reached the plateau at the center of the Shattered Plains. The central plateau. Narak. Exile. Home. She ripped the helm of the Shardplate from her head, taking a deep breath of cool air. Plate ventilated wonderfully, but even it grew stuffy after extended exertions. Other soldiers landed behind hershe had taken some fifteen hundred this run. Fortunately, this time they'd arrived well before the humans, and had harvested the gemheart with minimal fighting. Devi carried it; he had earned the privilege by being the one to spot the chrysalis from afar. Almost she wished it had not been so easy a run. Almost. Where are you, Blackthorn? she thought, looking westward. Why have you not come to face me again? She thought she'd seen him on that run a week or so back, when they'd been forced off the plateau by his son. Eshonai had not participated in that fight; her wounded leg ached, and the jumping from plateau to plateau had stressed it, even in Shardplate. Perhaps she should not be going on these runs in the first place. She'd wanted to be there in case her strike force grew surrounded, and needed a Shardbearereven a wounded oneto break them free. Her leg still hurt, but Plate cushioned it enough. Soon she would have to return to the fighting. Perhaps if she participated directly, the Blackthorn would appear again. She needed to speak with him. She felt an urgency to do so blowing upon the winds themselves. Her soldiers raised hands in farewell as they went their separate ways. Many softly sang or hummed a song to the Rhythm of Mourning. These days, few sang to Excitement, or even to Resolve. Step by step, storm by storm, depression claimed her peoplethe listeners, as they called their race. "Parshendi" was a human term. Eshonai strode toward the ruins that dominated Narak. After so many years, there wasn't much left. Ruins of ruins, one might call them. The works of men and listeners alike did not last long before the might of the highstorms. That stone spire ahead, that had probably once been a tower. Over the centuries, it had grown a thick coating of crem from the raging storms. The soft crem had seeped into cracks and filled windows, then slowly hardened. The tower now looked like an enormous stalagmite, rounded point toward the sky, side knobbed with rock that looked as if it had been melted. The spire must have had a strong core to survive the winds so long. Other examples of ancient engineering had not fared so well. Eshonai passed lumps and mounds, remnants of fallen buildings that had slowly been consumed by the Shattered Plains. The storms were unpredictable. Sometimes huge sections of rock would break free from formations, leaving gouges and jagged edges. Other times, spires would stand for centuries, growingnot shrinkingas the winds both weathered and augmented them. Eshonai had discovered similar ruins in her explorations, such as the one she'd been on when her people had first encountered humans. Only seven years ago, but also an eternity. She had loved those days, exploring a wide world that felt infinite. And now . . . Now she spent her life trapped on this one plateau. The wilderness called to her, sang that she should gather up what things she could carry and strike out. Unfortunately, that was no longer her destiny. She passed into the shadow of a big lump of rock that she always imagined might have been a city gate. From what little they'd learned from their spies over the years, she knew that the Alethi did not understand. They marched over the uneven surface of the plateaus and saw only natural rock, never knowing that they traversed the bones of a city long dead. Eshonai shivered, and attuned the Rhythm of the Lost. It was a soft beat, yet still violent, with sharp, separated notes. She did not attune it for long. Remembering the fallen was important, but working to protect the living was more so. She attuned Resolve again and entered Narak. Here, the listeners had built the best home they could during the years of war. Rocky shelves had become barracks, carapace from greatshells forming the walls and roofs. Mounds that had once been buildings now grew rockbuds for food on their leeward sides. Much of the Shattered Plains had once been populated, but the largest city had been here at the center. So now the ruins of her people made their home in the ruins of a dead city. They had named it Narakexilefor it was where they had come to be separated from their gods. Listeners, both malen and femalen, raised hands to her as she passed. So few remained. The humans were relentless in their pursuit of vengeance. She didn't blame them. She turned toward the Hall of Art. It was nearby, and she hadn't put in an appearance there for days. Inside, soldiers did a laughable job of painting. Eshonai strode among them, still wearing her Shardplate, helm under her arm. The long building had no roofallowing in plenty of light to paint byand the walls were thick with longhardened crem. Holding thickbristled brushes, the soldiers tried their best to depict the arrangement of rockbud flowers on a pedestal at the center. Eshonai did a round of the artists, looking at their work. Paper was precious and canvas nonexistent, so they painted on shell. The paintings were awful. Splotches of garish color, offcenter petals . . . Eshonai paused beside Varanis, one of her lieutenants. He held the brush delicately between armored fingers, a hulking form before an easel. Plates of chitin armor grew from his arms, shoulders, chest, even head. They were matched by her own, under her Plate. "You are getting better," Eshonai said to him, speaking to the Rhythm of Praise. He looked to her, and hummed softly to Skepticism. Eshonai chuckled, resting a hand on his shoulder. "It actually looks like flowers, Varanis. I mean it." "It looks like muddy water on a brown plateau," he said. "Maybe with some brown leaves floating in it. Why do colors turn brown when they mix? Three beautiful colors put together, and they become the least beautiful color. It makes no sense, General." General. At times, she felt as awkward in the position as these men did trying to paint pictures. She wore warform, as she needed the armor for battle, but she preferred workform. More limber, more rugged. It wasn't that she disliked leading these men, but doing the same thing every daydrills, plateau runs numbed her mind. She wanted to be seeing new things, going new places. Instead, she joined her people in a long funeral vigil as, one by one, they died. No. We will find a way out of it. The art was part of that, she hoped. By her order, each man or woman took a turn in the Hall of Art at their appointed time. And they tried; they tried hard. So far, it had been about as successful as trying to leap a chasm with the other side out of sight. "No spren?" she asked. "Not a one." He said it to the Rhythm of Mourning. She heard that rhythm far too often these days. "Keep trying," she said. "We will not lose this battle for lack of effort." "But General," Varanis said, "what is the point? Having artists won't save us from the swords of humans." Nearby, other soldiers turned to hear her answer. "Artists won't help," she said to the Rhythm of Peace. "But my sister is confident that she is close to discovering new forms. If we can discover how to create artists, then it might teach her more about the process of changeand that might help her with her research. Help her discover forms stronger, even, than warform. Artists won't get us out of this, but some other form might." Varanis nodded. He was a good soldier. Not all of them werewarform did not intrinsically make one more disciplined. Unfortunately, it did hamper one's artistic skill. Eshonai had tried painting. She couldn't think the right way, couldn't grasp the abstraction needed to create art. Warform was a good form, versatile. It didn't impede thought, like mateform did. As with workform, you were yourself when you were warform. But each had its quirks. A worker had difficulty committing violencethere was a block in the mind somewhere. That was one of the reasons she liked the form. It forced her to think differently to get around problems. Neither form could create art. Not well, at least. Mateform was better, but came with a whole host of other problems. Keeping those types focused on anything productive was almost impossible. There were two other forms, though the firstdullformwas one they rarely used. It was a relic of the past, before they'd rediscovered something better. That left only nimbleform, a general form that was lithe and careful. They used it for nurturing young and doing the kind of work that required more dexterity than brawn. Few could be spared for that form, though it was more skilled at art. The old songs spoke of hundreds of forms. Now they knew of only five. Well, six if one counted slaveform, the form with no spren, no soul, and no song. The form the humans were accustomed to, the ones they called parshmen. It wasn't really a form at all, however, but a lack of any form. Eshonai left the Hall of Art, helm under her arm, leg aching. She passed through the watering square, where nimbles had crafted a large pool from sculpted crem. It caught rain during the riddens of a storm, thick with nourishment. Here, workers carried buckets to fetch water. Their forms were strong, almost like that of warform, though with thinner fingers and no armor. Many nodded to her, though as a general she had no authority over them. She was their last Shardbearer. A group of three mateformstwo female, one maleplayed in the water, splashing at one another. Barely clothed, they dripped with what others would be drinking. "You three," Eshonai snapped at them. "Shouldn't you be doing something?" Plump and vapid, they grinned at Eshonai. "Come in!" one called. "It's fun!" "Out," Eshonai said, pointing. The three muttered to the Rhythm of Irritation as they climbed from the water. Nearby, several workers shook their heads as they passed, one singing to Praise in appreciation of Eshonai. Workers did not like confrontation. It was an excuse. Just as those who took on mateform used their form as an excuse for their inane activities. When a worker, Eshonai had trained herself to confront when necessary. She'd even been a mate once, and had proven to herself firsthand that one could indeed be productive as a mate, despite . . . distractions. Of course, the rest of her experiences as a mate had been an utter disaster. She spoke to Reprimand to the mateforms, her words so passionate that she actually attracted angerspren. She saw them coming from a ways off, drawn by her emotion, moving with an incredible speedlike lightning dancing toward her across the distant stone. The lightning pooled at her feet, turning the stones red. That put the fear of the gods into the mateforms, and they ran off to report to the Hall of Art. Hopefully, they wouldn't end up in an alcove along the way, mating. Her stomach churned at the thought. She had never been able to fathom people who wanted to remain in mateform. Most couples, in order to have a child, would enter the form and sequester themselves away for a yearthen would be out of the form as soon after the child's birth as possible. After all, who would want to go out in public like that? The humans did it. That had baffled her during those early days, when she'd spent time learning their language, trading with them. Not only did humans not change forms, they were always ready to mate, always distracted by sexual urges. What she wouldn't have given to be able to go among them unnoticed, to adopt their monochrome skin for a year and walk their highways, see their grand cities. Instead, she and the others had ordered the murder of the Alethi king in a desperate gambit to stop the listener gods from returning. Well, that had workedthe Alethi king hadn't been able to put his plan into action. But now, her people were slowly being destroyed as a result. She finally reached the rock formation she called home: a small, collapsed dome. It reminded her of the ones on the edge of the Shattered Plains, actually the enormous ones that the humans called warcamps. Her people had lived in those, before abandoning them for the security of the Shattered Plains, with its chasms the humans couldn't jump. Her home was much, much smaller, of course. During the early days of living here, Venli had crafted a roof of greatshell carapace and built walls to divide the space into chambers. She'd covered it all over with crem, which had hardened with time, creating something that actually felt like a home instead of a shanty. Eshonai set her helm on a table just inside, but left the rest of her armor on. Shardplate just felt right to her. She liked the sensation of strength. It let her know that something was still reliable in the world. And with the power of Shardplate, she could mostly ignore the wound to her leg. She ducked through a few rooms, nodding to the people she passed. Venli's associates were scholars, though no one knew the proper form for true scholarship. Nimbleform was their makeshift substitute for now. Eshonai found her sister beside the window of the farthest chamber. Demid, Venli's oncemate, sat next to her. Venli had held nimbleform for three years, as long as they'd known of the form, though in Eshonai's mind's eye she still saw her sister as a worker, with thicker arms and a stouter torso. That was the past. Now, Venli was a slender woman with a thin face, her marblings delicate swirling patterns of red and white. Nimbleform grew long hairstrands, with no carapace helm to block them. Venli's, a deep red, flowed down to her waist, where they were tied in three places. She wore a robe, drawn tight at the waist and showing a hint of breasts at the chest. This was not mateform, so they were small. Venli and her oncemate were close, though their time as mates had produced no children. If they'd gone to the battlefield, they'd have been a warpair. Instead, they were a researchpair, or something. The things they spent their days doing were very unlistener. That was the point. Eshonai's people could not afford to be what they had been in the past. The days of lounging isolated on these plateaussinging songs to one another, only occasionally fightingwere over. "So?" Venli asked to Curiosity. "We won," Eshonai said, leaning back against the wall and folding her arms with a clink of Shardplate. "The gemheart is ours. We will continue to eat." "That is well," Venli said. "And your human?" "Dalinar Kholin. He did not come to this battle." "He will not face you again," Venli said. "You nearly killed him last time." She said it to the Rhythm of Amusement as she rose, picking up a piece of paper they made it from dried rockbud pulp following a harvestwhich she handed to her oncemate. Looking it over, he nodded and began making notes on his own sheet. That paper required precious time and resources to make, but Venli insisted the reward would be worth the effort. She'd better be right. Venli regarded Eshonai. She had keen eyesglassy and dark, like those of all listeners. Venli's always seemed to have an extra depth of secret knowledge to them. In the right light, they had a violet cast. "What would you do, Sister?" Venli asked. "If you and this Kholin were actually able to stop trying to kill each other long enough to have a conversation?" "I'd sue for peace." "We murdered his brother," Venli said. "We slaughtered King Gavilar on a night when he'd invited us into his home. That is not something the Alethi will forget, or forgive." Eshonai unfolded her arms and flexed a gauntleted hand. That night. A desperate plan, made between herself and five others. She had been part of it despite her youth, because of her knowledge of the humans. All had voted the same. Kill the man. Kill him, and risk destruction. For if he had lived to do what he told them that night, all would have been lost. The others who had made that decision with her were dead now. "I have discovered the secret of stormform," Venli said. "What?" Eshonai stood up straight. "You were to be working on a form to help! A form for diplomats, or for scholars." "Those will not save us," Venli said to Amusement. "If we wish to deal with the humans, we will need the ancient powers." "Venli," Eshonai said, grabbing her sister by the arm. "Our gods!" Venli didn't flinch. "The humans have Surgebinders." "Perhaps not. It could have been an Honorblade." "You fought him. Was it an Honorblade that struck you, wounded your leg, sent you limping?" "I . . ." Her leg ached. "We don't know which of the songs are true," Venli said. Though she said it to Resolve, she sounded tired, and she drew exhaustionspren. They came with a sound like wind, blowing in through the windows and doors like jets of translucent vapor before becoming stronger, more visible, and spinning around her head like swirls of steam. My poor sister. She works herself as hard as the soldiers do. "If the Surgebinders have returned," Venli continued, "we must strive for something meaningful, something that can ensure our freedom. The forms of power, Eshonai . . ." She glanced at Eshonai's hand, still on her arm. "At least sit and listen. And stop looming like a mountain." Eshonai removed her fingers, but did not sit. Her Shardplate's weight would break a chair. Instead, she leaned forward, inspecting the table full of papers. Venli had invented the script herself. They'd learned that concept from the humansmemorizing songs was good, but not perfect, even when you had the rhythms to guide you. Information stored on pages was more practical, especially for research. Eshonai had taught herself the script, but reading was still difficult for her. She did not have much time to practice. "So . . . stormform?" Eshonai said. "Enough people of that form," Venli said, "could control a highstorm, or even summon one." "I remember the song that speaks of this form," Eshonai said. "It was a thing of the gods." "Most of the forms are related to them in some way," Venli said. "Can we really trust the accuracy of words first sung so long ago? When those songs were memorized, our people were mostly dullform." It was a form of low intelligence, low capacity. They used it now to spy on the humans. Once, it and mateform had been the only forms her people had known. Demid shuffled some of the pages, moving a stack. "Venli is right, Eshonai. This is a risk we must take." "We could negotiate with the Alethi," Eshonai said. "To what end?" Venli said, again to Skepticism, her exhaustionspren finally fading, the spren spinning away to search out more fresh sources of emotion. "Eshonai, you keep saying you want to negotiate. I think it is because you are fascinated by humans. You think they'll let you go freely among them? A person they see as having the form of a rebellious slave?" "Centuries ago," Demid said, "we escaped both our gods and the humans. Our ancestors left behind civilization, power, and might in order to secure freedom. I would not give that up, Eshonai. Stormform. With it, we can destroy the Alethi army." "With them gone," Venli said, "you can return to exploration. No responsibilityyou could travel, make your maps, discover places no person has ever seen." "What I want for myself is meaningless," Eshonai said to Reprimand, "so long as we are all in danger of destruction." She scanned the specks on the page, scribbles of songs. Songs without music, written out as they were. Their souls stripped away. Could the listeners' salvation really be in something so terrible? Venli and her team had spent five years recording all of the songs, learning the nuances from the elderly, capturing them in these pages. Through collaboration, research, and deep thought, they had discovered nimbleform. "It is the only way," Venli said to Peace. "We will bring this to the Five, Eshonai. I would have you on our side." "I . . . I will consider." Ym carefully trimmed the wood from the side of the small block. He held it up to the spherelight beside his bench, pinching his spectacles by the rim and holding them closer to his eyes. Such delightful inventions, spectacles. To live was to be a fragment of the cosmere that was experiencing itself. How could he properly experience if he couldn't see? The Azish man who had first created these devices was long deceased, and Ym had submitted a proposal that he be considered one of the Honored Dead. Ym lowered the piece of wood and continued to carve it, carefully whittling off the front to form a curve. Some of his colleagues bought their laststhe wooden forms around which a cobbler built his shoesfrom carpenters, but Ym had been taught to make his own. That was the old way, the way it had been done for centuries. If something had been done one way for such a long time, he figured there was probably a good reason. Behind him stood the shadowed cubbies of a cobbler's shop, the toes of dozens of shoes peeking out like the noses of eels in their holes. These were test shoes, used to judge size, choose materials, and decide styles so he could construct the perfect shoe to fit the foot and character of the individual. A fitting could take quite a while, assuming you did it properly. Something moved in the dimness to his right. Ym glanced in that direction, but didn't change his posture. The spren had been coming more often lately specks of light, like those from a piece of crystal suspended in a sunbeam. He did not know its type, as he had never seen one like it before. It moved across the surface of the workbench, slinking closer. When it stopped, light crept upward from it, like small plants growing or climbing from their burrows. When it moved again, those withdrew. Ym returned to his sculpting. "It will be for making a shoe." The evening shop was quiet save for the scraping of his knife on wood. "Shshoe . . . ?" a voice asked. Like that of a young woman, soft, with a kind of chiming musicality to it. "Yes, my friend," he said. "A shoe for young children. I find myself in need of those more and more these days." "Shoe," the spren said. "For chchildren. Little people." Ym brushed wooden scraps off the bench for later sweeping, then set the last on the bench near the spren. It shied away, like a reflection off a mirror translucent, really just a shimmer of light. He withdrew his hand and waited. The spren inched forwardtentative, like a cremling creeping out of its crack after a storm. It stopped, and light grew upward from it in the shape of tiny sprouts. Such an odd sight. "You are an interesting experience, my friend," Ym said as the shimmer of light moved onto the last itself. "One in which I am honored to participate." "I . . ." the spren said. "I . . ." The spren's form shook suddenly, then grew more intense, like light being focused. "He comes." Ym stood up, suddenly anxious. Something moved on the street outside. Was it that one? That watcher, in the military coat? But no, it was just a child, peering in through the open door. Ym smiled, opening his drawer of spheres and letting more light into the room. The child shied back, just as the spren had. The spren had vanished somewhere. It did that when others drew near. "No need to fear," Ym said, settling back down on his stool. "Come in. Let me get a look at you." The dirty young urchin peered back in. He wore only a ragged pair of trousers, no shirt, though that was common here in Iri, where both days and nights were usually warm. The poor child's feet were dirty and scraped. "Now," Ym said, "that won't do. Come, young one, settle down. Let's get something on those feet." He moved out one of his smaller stools. "They say you don't charge nothin'," the boy said, not moving. "They are quite wrong," Ym said. "But I think you will find my cost bearable." "Don't have no spheres." "No spheres are needed. Your payment will be your story. Your experiences. I would hear them." "They said you was strange," the boy said, finally walking into the shop. "They were right," Ym said, patting the stool. The urchin stepped timidly up to the stool, walking with a limp he tried to hide. He was Iriali, though the grime darkened his skin and hair, both of which were golden. The skin less soyou needed the light to see it rightbut the hair certainly. It was the mark of their people. Ym motioned for the child to raise his good foot, then got out a washcloth, wetted it, and cleaned away the grime. He wasn't about to do a fitting on feet so dirty. Noticeably, the boy tucked back the foot he'd limped on, as if trying to hide that it had a rag wrapped around it. "So," Ym said, "your story?" "You're old," the boy said. "Older than anyone I know. Grandpa old. You must know everythin' already. Why do you want to hear from me?" "It is one of my quirks," Ym said. "Come now. Let's hear it." The boy huffed, but talked. Briefly. That wasn't uncommon. He wanted to hold his story to himself. Slowly, with careful questions, Ym pried the story free. The boy was the son of a whore, and had been kicked out as soon as he could fend for himself. That had been three years ago, the boy thought. He was probably eight now. As he listened, Ym cleaned the first foot, then clipped and filed the nails. Once done, he motioned for the other foot. The boy reluctantly lifted it up. Ym undid the rag, and found a nasty cut on the bottom of that foot. It was already infected, crawling with rotspren, tiny motes of red. Ym hesitated. "Needed to get some shoes," the urchin said, looking the other way. "Can't keep on without 'em." The rip in the skin was jagged. Done climbing over a fence, perhaps? Ym thought. The boy looked at him, feigning nonchalance. A wound like this would slow an urchin down terribly, which on the streets could easily mean death. Ym knew that all too well. He looked up at the boy, noting the shadow of worry in those little eyes. The infection had spread up the leg. "My friend," Ym whispered, "I believe I am going to need your help." "What?" the urchin said. "Nothing," Ym replied, reaching into the drawer of his table. The light spilling out was just from five diamond chips. Every urchin who had come to him had seen those. So far, Ym had been robbed of them only twice. He dug more deeply, unfolding a hidden compartment in the drawer and taking a more powerful spherea broamfrom there, covering its light quickly in his hand while reaching for some antiseptic with the other hand. The medicine wasn't going to be enough, not with the boy unable to stay off his feet. Lying in bed for weeks to heal, constantly applying expensive medication? Impossible for an urchin fighting for food each day. Ym brought his hands back, sphere tucked inside of one. Poor child. It must hurt something fierce. The boy probably ought to have been laid out in bed, feverish, but every urchin knew to chew ridgebark to stay alert and awake longer than they should. Nearby, the sparkling light spren peeked out from underneath a stack of leather squares. Ym applied the medication, then set it aside and lifted the boy's foot, humming softly. The glow in Ym's other hand vanished. The rotspren fled from the wound. When Ym removed his hand, the cut had scabbed over, the color returning to normal, the signs of infection gone. So far, Ym had used this ability only a handful of times, and had always disguised it as medicine. It was unlike anything he had ever heard of. Perhaps that was why he had been given itso the cosmere could experience it. "Hey," the boy said, "that feels a lot better." "I'm glad," Ym said, returning the sphere and the medicine to his drawer. The spren had retreated. "Let us see if I have something that fits you." He began fitting shoes. Normally, after fitting, he'd send the patron away and craft a perfect set of shoes just for them. For this child, unfortunately, he'd have to use shoes he'd already made. He'd had too many urchins never return for their pair of shoes, leaving him to fret and wonder. Had something happened to them? Had they simply forgotten? Or had their natural suspicion gotten the better of them? Fortunately, he had several good, sturdy pairs that might fit this boy. I need more treated hogshide, he thought, making a note. Children would not properly care for shoes. He needed leather that would age well even if unattended. "You're really gonna give me a pair of shoes," the urchin said. "For nothin'?" "Nothing but your story," Ym said, slipping another testing shoe onto the boy's foot. He'd given up on trying to train urchins to wear socks. "Why?" "Because," Ym said, "you and I are One." "One what?" "One being," Ym said. He set aside that shoe and got out another. "Long ago, there was only One. One knew everything, but had experienced nothing. And so, One became manyus, people. The One, who is both male and female, did so to experience all things." "One. You mean God?" "If you wish to say it that way," Ym said. "But it is not completely true. I accept no god. You should accept no god. We are Iriali, and part of the Long Trail, of which this is the Fourth Land." "You sound like a priest." "Accept no priests either," Ym said. "Those are from other lands, come to preach to us. Iriali need no preaching, only experience. As each experience is different, it brings completeness. Eventually, all will be gathered back inwhen the Seventh Land is attainedand we will once again become One." "So you an' me . . ." the urchin said. "Are the same?" "Yes. Two minds of a single being experiencing different lives." "That's stupid." "It is simply a matter of perspective," Ym said, dusting the boy's feet with powder and slipping back on a pair of the test shoes. "Please walk on those for a moment." The boy gave him a strange look, but obeyed, trying a few steps. He didn't limp any longer. "Perspective," Ym said, holding up his hand and wiggling his fingers. "From very close up, the fingers on a hand might seem individual and alone. Indeed, the thumb might think it has very little in common with the pinky. But with proper perspective, it is realized that the fingers are part of something much larger. That, indeed, they are One." The urchin frowned. Some of that had probably been beyond him. I need to speak more simply, and "Why do you get to be the finger with the expensive ring," the boy said, pacing back the other direction, "while I gotta be the pinky with the broken fingernail?" Ym smiled. "I know it sounds unfair, but there can be no unfairness, as we are all the same in the end. Besides, I didn't always have this shop." "You didn't?" "No. I think you'd be surprised at where I came from. Please sit back down." The boy settled down. "That medicine works real well. Real, real well." Ym slipped off the shoes, using the powderwhich had rubbed off in places to judge how the shoe fit. He fished out a pair of premade shoes, then worked at them for a moment, flexing them in his hands. He'd want a cushion on the bottom for the wounded foot, but something that would tear off after a few weeks, once the wound was healed. . . . "The things you're talking about," the boy said. "They sound dumb to me. I mean, if we're all the same person, shouldn't everyone know this already?" "As One, we knew truth," Ym said, "but as many, we need ignorance. We exist in variety to experience all kinds of thought. That means some of us must know and others must notjust like some must be rich, and others must be poor." He worked the shoe a moment longer. "More people did know this, once. It's not talked about as much as it should be. Here, let's see if these fit right." He handed the boy the shoes, who put them on and tied the laces. "Your life might be unpleasant" Ym began. "Unpleasant?" "All right. Downright awful. But it will get better, young one. I promise it." "I thought," the boy said, stamping his good foot to test the shoes, "that you were gonna tell me that life is awful, but it all don't matter in the end, 'cuz we're going the same place." "That's true," Ym said, "but isn't very comforting right now, is it?" "Nope." Ym turned back to his worktable. "Try not to walk on that wounded foot too much, if you can help it." The urchin strode to the door with a sudden urgency, as if eager to get away before Ym changed his mind and took back the shoes. He did stop at the doorway, though. "If we're all just the same person trying out different lives," the boy said, "you don't need to give away shoes. 'Cuz it don't matter." "You wouldn't hit yourself in the face, would you? If I make your life better, I make my own better." "That's crazy talk," the boy said. "I think you're just a nice person." He ducked out, not speaking another word. Ym smiled, shaking his head. Eventually, he went back to work on his last. The spren peeked out again. "Thank you," Ym said. "For your help." He didn't know why he could do what he did, but he knew the spren was involved. "He's still here," the spren whispered. Ym looked up toward the doorway out onto the night street. The urchin was there? Something rustled behind Ym. He jumped, spinning. The workroom was a place of dark corners and cubbies. Had he perhaps heard a rat? Why was the door into the back roomwhere Ym sleptopen? He usually left that closed. A shadow moved in the blackness back there. "If you've come for the spheres," Ym said, trembling, "I have only the five chips here." More rustling. The shadow separated itself from the darkness, resolving into a man with dark, Makabaki skinall save for a pale crescent on his cheek. He wore black and silver, a uniform, but not one from any military that Ym recognized. Thick gloves, with stiff cuffs at the back. "I had to look very hard," the man said, "to discover your indiscretion." "I . . ." Ym stammered. "Just . . . five chips . . ." "You have lived a clean life, since your youth as a carouser," the man said, his voice even. "A young man of means who drank and partied away what his parents left him. That is not illegal. Murder, however, is." Ym sank down onto his stool. "I didn't know. I didn't know it would kill her." "Poison delivered," the man said, stepping into the room, "in the form of a bottle of wine." "They told me the vintage itself was the sign!" Ym said. "That she'd know the message was from them, and that it meant she would need to pay! I was desperate for money. To eat, you see. Those on the streets are not kind . . ." "You were an accomplice to murder," the man said, pulling his gloves on more tightly, first one hand, then the other. He spoke with such a stark lack of emotion, he could have been conversing about the weather. "I didn't know . . ." Ym pled. "You are guilty nonetheless." The man reached his hand to the side, and a weapon formed from mist there, then fell into his hand. A Shardblade? What kind of constable of the law was this? Ym stared at that wondrous, silvery Blade. Then he ran. It appeared that he still had useful instincts from his time on the streets. He managed to fling a stack of leather toward the man and duck the Blade as it swung for him. Ym scrambled out onto the dark street and charged away, shouting. Perhaps someone would hear. Perhaps someone would help. Nobody heard. Nobody helped. Ym was an old man now. By the time he reached the first cross street, he was gasping for air. He stopped beside the old barber shop, dark inside, door locked. The little spren moved along beside him, a shimmering light that sprayed outward in a circle. Beautiful. "I guess," Ym said, panting, "it is . . . my time. May One . . . find this memory . . . pleasing." Footsteps slapped on the street behind, getting closer. "No," the spren whispered. "Light!" Ym dug in his pocket and pulled out a sphere. Could he use it, somehow, to The constable's shoulder slammed Ym against the wall of the barber shop. Ym groaned, dropping the sphere. The man in silver spun him around. He looked like a shade in the night, a silhouette against the black sky. "It was forty years ago," Ym whispered. "Justice does not expire." The man shoved the Shardblade through Ym's chest. Experience ended. Rysn liked to pretend that her pot of Shin grass was not stupid, but merely contemplative. She sat near the prow of her catamaran, holding the pot in her lap. The otherwise still surface of the Reshi Sea rippled from the paddling of the guide behind her. The warm, damp air made beads of sweat form on Rysn's brow and neck. It was probably going to rain again. Precipitation here on the sea was the worst kindnot mighty or impressive like a highstorm, not even insistent like an ordinary shower. Here, it was just a misting haze, more than a fog but less than a drizzle. Enough to ruin hair, makeup, clothingindeed, every element of a careful young woman's efforts to present a suitable face for trading. Rysn shifted the pot in her lap. She'd named the grass Tyvnk. Sullen. Her babsk had laughed at the name. He understood. In naming the grass, she acknowledged that he was right and she had been wrong; his trade with the Shin people last year had been exceptionally profitable. Rysn chose not to be sullen at being proven so clearly wrong. She'd let her plant be sullen instead. They'd traversed these waters for two days now, and then only after waiting at port for weeks until the right time between highstorms for a trip onto the nearly enclosed sea. Today, the waters were shockingly still. Almost as serene as those of the Purelake. Vstim himself rode two boats over in their irregular flotilla. Paddled by new parshmen, the sixteen sleek catamarans were laden with goods that had been purchased with the profits of their last expedition. Vstim was still resting in the back of his boat. He looked like little more than another bundle of cloth, almost indistinguishable from the sacks of goods. He would be fine. People got sick. It happened, but he would become well again. And the blood you saw on his handkerchief? She suppressed the thought and pointedly turned around in her seat, shifting Tyvnk to the crook of her left arm. She kept the pot very clean. That soil stuff the grass needed in order to live was even worse than crem, and it had a proclivity for ruining clothing. Gu, the flotilla's guide, rode in her own boat, just behind her. He looked a lot like a Purelaker with those long limbs, the leathery skin, and dark hair. Every Purelaker she'd met, however, had cared deeply about those gods of theirs. She doubted Gu had ever cared about anything. That included getting them to their destination in a timely manner. "You said we were near," she said to him. "Oh, we are," he said, lifting his oar and then slipping it back down into the water. "Soon, now." He spoke Thaylen rather well, which was why he'd been hired. It certainly wasn't for his punctuality. "Define 'soon,'" Rysn said. "Define . . ." "What do you mean by 'soon'?" "Soon. Today, maybe." Maybe. Delightful. Gu continued to paddle, only doing so on one side of the boat, yet somehow keeping them from going in circles. At the rear of Rysn's boat, Kylrmhead of their guardsplayed with her parasol, opening it and closing it again. He seemed to consider it a wondrous invention, though they'd been popular in Thaylenah for ages now. Shows how rarely Vstim's workers get back to civilization. Another cheerful thought. Well, she'd apprenticed under Vstim wanting to travel to exotic places, and exotic this was. True, she'd expected cosmopolitan and exotic to go hand in hand. If she'd had half a witwhich she wasn't sure she did, these daysshe'd have realized that the really successful traders weren't the ones who went where everyone else wanted to go. "Hard," Gu said, still paddling with his lethargic pace. "Patterns are off, these days. The gods do not walk where they always should. We shall find her. Yes, we shall." Rysn stifled a sigh and turned forward. With Vstim incapacitated again, she was in charge of leading the flotilla. She wished she knew where she was leading itor even knew how to find their destination. That was the trouble with islands that moved. The boats glided past a shoal of branches breaking the sea's surface. Encouraged by the wind, gentle waves lapped against the stiff branches, which reached out of the waters like the fingers of drowning men. The sea was deeper than the Purelake, with its bafflingly shallow waters. Those trees would be dozens of feet tall at the very least, with bark of stone. Gu called them inah, which apparently meant bad. They could slice up a boat's hull. Sometimes they'd pass branches hiding just beneath the glassy surface, almost invisible. She didn't know how Gu knew to steer clear of them. In this, as in so much else, they just had to trust him. What would they do if he led them into an ambush out here on these silent waters? Suddenly, she felt very glad that Vstim had ordered their guards to monitor his fabrial that showed if people were drawing near. It Land. Rysn stood up in the catamaran, making it rock precariously. There was something ahead, a distant dark line. "Ah," Gu said. "See? Soon." Rysn remained standing, waving for her parasol when a sprinkle of rain started to fall. The parasol barely helped, though it was waxed to double as an umbrella. In her excitement, she hardly gave itor her increasingly frizzy hair a thought. Finally. The island was much bigger than she'd expected. She'd imagined it to be like a very large boat, not this towering rock formation jutting from the waters like a boulder in a field. It was different from other islands she'd seen; there didn't seem to be any beach, and it wasn't flat and low, but mountainous. Shouldn't the sides and top have eroded over time? "It's so green," Rysn said as they drew closer. "The Taina is a good place to grow," Gu said. "Good place to live. Except when it's at war." "When two islands get too close," Rysn said. She'd read of this in preparation, though there were not many scholars who cared enough about the Reshi to write of them. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of these moving islands floated in the sea. The people on them lived simple lives, interpreting the movements of the islands as divine will. "Not always," Gu said, chuckling. "Sometimes close Taina is good. Sometimes bad." "What determines?" Rysn asked. "Why, the Taina itself." "The island decides," Rysn said flatly, humoring him. Primitives. What was her babsk expecting to gain by trading here? "How can an island" Then the island ahead of them moved. Not in the drifting way she'd imagined. The island's very shape changed, stones twisting and undulating, a huge section of rock rising in a motion that seemed lethargic until one appreciated the grand scale. Rysn sat down with a plop, her eyes wide. The rockthe leglifted, streaming water like rainfall. It lurched forward, then crashed back down into the sea with incredible force. The Taina, the gods of the Reshi Isles, were greatshells. This was the largest beast she'd ever seen, or ever heard of. Big enough to make mythological monsters like the chasmfiends of distant Natanatan seem like pebbles in comparison! "Why didn't anyone tell me?" she demanded, looking back at the boat's other two occupants. Surely Kylrm at least should have said something. "Is better to see," Gu said, paddling with his usual relaxed posture. She did not much care for his smirk. "And take away that moment of discovery?" Kylrm said. "I remember when I first saw one move. It's worth not spoiling. We never tell the new guards when they first come." Rysn contained her annoyance and looked back at the "island." Curse those inaccurate accounts from her readings. Too much hearsay, not enough experience. She found it hard to believe that no one had ever recorded the truth. Likely, she simply had the wrong sources. A falling haze of rain shrouded the enormous beast in mist and enigma. What did a thing so big eat? Did it notice the people living upon its back; did it care? Kelek . . . What was mating like for these monsters? It had to be ancient. The boat drew into its shadow, and she could see the greenery growing across its stony skin. Shalebark mounds made vast fields of vibrant colors. Moss coated nearly everything. Vines and rockbuds wound around trunks of small trees that had gained a foothold in cracks between plates of the animal's shell. Gu led the convoy around the hind leggiving it a very wide berth, to her reliefand came up along the creature's flank. Here, the shell dipped down into the water, forming a platform. She heard the people before she saw them, their laughter rising amid splashes. The rain stopped, so Rysn lowered her parasol and shook it over the water. She finally spotted the people, a group of youths both male and female climbing up onto a ridge of shell and leaping from it into the sea. That was not so surprising. The water of the Reshi Sea, like that of the Purelake, was remarkably warm. She had once ventured into the water near her homeland. It was a frigid experience, and not one to be engaged in while of sound mind. Frequently, alcohol and bravado were involved in any ocean dip. Out here, though, she expected that swimmers were commonplace. She had not expected them to be unclothed. Rysn blushed furiously as a group of people ran past on the docklike shell outcropping, as bare as the day they were born. Young men and women alike, uncaring of who saw. She was no Alethi prude, but . . . Kelek! Shouldn't they wear something? Shamespren fell around her, shaped like white and red flower petals that drifted on a wind. Behind her, Gu chuckled. Kylrm joined him. "That's another thing we don't warn the newcomers about." Primitives, Rysn thought. She shouldn't blush so. She was an adult. Well, almost. The flotilla continued toward a section of shell that formed a kind of docka low plate that hung mostly above water. They settled in to wait, though for what, she didn't know. After a few moments, the plate lurchedwater streaming off itas the beast took another lethargic step. Waves lapped against the boats from the splashdown ahead. Once things were settled, Gu guided the boat to the dock. "Up you go," he said. "Shall we tie the boats to anything?" Rysn said. "No. Not safe, with movement. We will pull back." "And at night? How do you dock the boats?" "When we sleep, we move boats away, tie together. Sleep out there. Find island again in the morning." "Oh," Rysn said, taking a calming breath and checking to make sure her pot of grass was carefully stored in the bottom of the catamaran. She stood up. This was not going to be kind to her shoes, which had been quite expensive. She had a feeling the Reshi wouldn't care. She could probably meet their king barefooted. Passions! From what she'd seen, she could probably meet him barechested. She climbed up carefully, and was pleased to find that despite being an inch or so underwater, the shell was not slippery. Kylrm climbed up with her and she handed him the foldedup parasol, stepping back and waiting as Gu maneuvered his boat away. Another oarsman brought up his boat instead, a longer catamaran with parshmen to help row. Her babsk huddled inside, wrapped in his blanket despite the heat, head propped up against the back of the boat. His pale skin had a waxy cast. "Babsk . . ." Rysn said, heart wrenching. "We should have turned around." "Nonsense," he said, his voice frail. He smiled anyway. "I've suffered worse. The trade must happen. We've leveraged too much." "I will go to the island's king and traders," Rysn said. "And ask for them to come here to negotiate with you on the docks." Vstim coughed into his hand. "No. These people aren't like the Shin. My weakness will ruin the deal. Boldness. You must be bold with the Reshi." "Bold?" Rysn said, glancing at the boat guide, who lounged with fingers in the water. "Babsk . . . the Reshi are a relaxed people. I do not think much matters to them." "You will be surprised, then," Vstim said. He followed her gaze toward the nearby swimmers, who giggled and laughed as they leaped into the waters. "Life can be simple here, yes. It attracts such people like war attracts painspren." Attracts . . . One of the women scampered past, and Rysn noticed with shock that she had Thaylen eyebrows. Her skin had been tanned in the sun, so the difference in tones hadn't been immediately obvious. Picking through those swimming, Rysn saw others. Two that were probably Herdazians, even . . . an Alethi? Impossible. "People seek out this place," Vstim said. "They like the life of the Reshi. Here, they can simply go with the island. Fight when it fights another island. Relax otherwise. There will be people like this in any culture, for every society is made of individuals. You must learn this. Do not let your assumptions about a culture block your ability to perceive the individual, or you will fail." She nodded. He seemed so frail, but his words were firm. She tried not to think about the swimming people. The fact that at least one of them was of her own kind made her even more embarrassed. "If you cannot trade with them . . ." Rysn said. "You must do it." Rysn felt cold, despite the heat. This was what she'd joined with Vstim to do, wasn't it? How many times had she wished he would let her lead? Why feel so timid now? She glanced toward her own boat, moving off, carrying her pot of grass. She looked back at her babsk. "Tell me what to do." "They know much of foreigners," Vstim said. "More than we know of them. This is because so many of us come to live among them. Many of the Reshi are as carefree as you say, but there are also many who are not. Those prefer to fight. And a trade . . . it is like a fight to them." "To me too," Rysn said. "I know these people," Vstim said. "We must have Passion that Talik is not here. He is their best, and often goes to trade with other islands. Whichever you do meet for trade, he or she will judge you as they would judge a rival in battle. And to them, battle is about posturing. "I once had the misfortune to be on an isle during war." He paused, coughing, but spurned the drink Kylrm tried to give him. "As the two islands raged, the people climbed down into boats to exchange insults and boasts. They would each start with their weakest, who would yell out boasts, then progress in a kind of verbal duel up to their greatest. After that, arrows and spears, struggling on ships and in the water. Fortunately, there was more yelling than actual cutting." Rysn swallowed, nodding. "You are not ready for this, child," Vstim said. "I know." "Good. Finally you realize it. Go now. They will not suffer us long on their island unless we agree to join them permanently." "Which would require . . . ?" Rysn said. "Well, for one, it requires giving all you own to their king." "Lovely," Rysn said, rising. "I wonder how he'd look wearing my shoes." She took a deep breath. "You still haven't told me what we're trading for." "They know," her babsk said, then coughed. "Your conversation will not be a negotiation. The terms were set years ago." She turned to him, frowning. "What?" "This is not about what you can get," Vstim said, "but about whether or not they think you are worthy of it. Convince them." He hesitated. "Passions guide you, child. Do well." It seemed a plea. If their flotilla was turned away . . . The cost of this trade was not in the goodswoods, cloth, simple supplies purchased cheaplybut in the outfitting of a convoy. It was in traveling so far, paying guides, wasting time waiting for a break between storms, then more time searching for the right island. If she was turned away, they could still sell what they hadbut at a stiff devastating loss, considering the high overhead of the trip. Two of the guards, Kylrm and Nlent, joined her as she left Vstim and walked along the docklike protrusion of shell. Now that they were so close, it was difficult to see a creature and not an island. Just ahead of her, the patina of lichen made the shell nearly indistinguishable from rock. Trees clustered here, their roots draping into the water, their branches reaching high and creating a forest. She hesitantly stepped onto the only path leading up from the waters. Here, the "ground" formed steps that seemed far too square and regular to be natural. "They cut into its shell?" Rysn said, climbing. Kylrm grunted. "Chulls can't feel their shells. This monster probably can't either." As they walked, he kept his hand on his gtet, a type of traditional Thaylen sword. The thing had a large triangular wedge of a blade with a grip directly at the base; you'd hold the grip like a fist, and the long blade would extend out down past the knuckles, with parts of the hilt resting around the wrist for support. Right now, he wore it in a sheath at his side, along with a bow on his back. Why was he was so anxious? The Reshi were not supposed to be dangerous. Perhaps when you were a paid guard, it was better to assume everyone was dangerous. The pathway wound upward through thick jungle. The trees here were limber and hale, their branches almost constantly moving. And when the beast stepped, everything shook. Vines trembled and twisted on the pathway or drooped from branches, and these pulled out of the way at her approach, but crept back quickly after her passing. Soon, she couldn't see the sea, or even smell its brine. The jungle enveloped everything. Its thick green and brown were broken occasionally by pink and yellow mounds of shalebark that seemed to have been growing for generations. She'd found the humidity oppressive before, but here it was overwhelming. She felt as if she were swimming, and even her thin linen skirt, blouse, and vest seemed as thick as old Thaylen highland winter gear. After an interminable climb, she heard voices. To her right, the forest opened up to a view of the ocean beyond. Rysn caught her breath. Endless blue waters, clouds dropping a haze of rain in patches that seemed so distinct. And in the distance . . . "Another one?" she asked, pointing toward a shadow on the horizon. "Yeah," Kylrm said. "Hopefully going the other way. I'd rather not be here when they decide to war." His grip tightened on the handle of his sword. The voices came from farther up the way, so Rysn resigned herself to more climbing. Her legs ached from the effort. Though the jungle remained impenetrable to her left, it remained open to her right, where the massive flank of the greatshell formed ridges and shelves. She caught sight of some people sitting around tents, leaning back and staring out over the sea. They hardly gave her and the two guards more than a glance. Up farther, she found more Reshi. These were jumping. Men and women alikeand in various states of undresswere taking turns leaping off the shell's outcroppings with whoops and shouts, plummeting toward the waters far below. Rysn grew nauseated just watching them. How high up were they? "They do it to shock you. They always jump from greater heights when a foreigner is here." Rysn nodded, thenwith a sudden startrealized that the comment hadn't come from one of her guards. She turned and discovered that to her left, the forest had moved back around a large outcrop of shell like a rock mound. There, hanging upside down and tied by his feet to a point at the top of the shell, was a lanky man with pale white skin verging on blue. He wore only a loincloth, and his skin was covered with hundreds upon hundreds of small, intricate tattoos. Rysn took a step toward him, but Kylrm grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back. "Aimian," he hissed. "Keep your distance." The blue fingernails and deep blue eyes should have been a clue. Rysn stepped back, though she couldn't see his Voidbringer shadow. "Keep your distance indeed," the man said. "Always a wise idea." His accent was unlike any she'd heard, though he spoke Thaylen well. He hung there with a pleasant smile on his face, as if completely indifferent to the fact that he was upside down. "Are you . . . well?" Rysn asked the man. "Hmmm?" he said. "Oh, between blackouts, yes. Quite well. I think I'm growing numb to the pain of my ankles, which is just delightful." Rysn brought her hands up to her chest, not daring to get any closer. Aimian. Very bad luck. She wasn't particularly superstitiousshe was even skeptical of the Passions sometimesbut . . . well, this was an Aimian. "What fell curses did you bring on this people, beast?" Kylrm demanded. "Improper puns," the man said lazily. "And a stench from something I ate that did not sit well with me. Are you off to speak with the king, then?" "I . . ." Rysn said. Behind her, another Reshi whooped and leaped from the shelf. "Yes." "Well," the creature said, "don't ask about the soul of their god. They don't like to speak of that, it turns out. Must be spectacular, to let the beasts grow this large. Beyond even the spren who inhabit the bodies of ordinary greatshells. Hmmm . . ." He seemed very pleased by something. "Do not feel for him, trademaster," Kylrm said softly to her, steering her away from the dangling prisoner. "He could escape if he wished." Nlent, the other guard, nodded. "They can take off their limbs. Take off their skin too. No real body to them. Just something evil, taking human form." The squat guard wore a charm on his wrist, a charm of courage, which he took off and held tightly in one hand. The charm hadn't any properties itself, of course. It was a reminder. Courage. Passion. Want what you need, embrace it, desire it and bring it to you. Well, what she needed was her babsk to be here with her. She turned her steps upward again, the confrontation with the Aimian leaving her unnerved. More people ran and leaped from the shelves to her right. Crazy. Trademaster, she thought. Kylrm called me "trademaster." She wasn't, not yet. She was property owned by Vstim; for now just an apprentice who provided occasional slave labor. She didn't deserve the title, but hearing it strengthened her. She led the way up the steps, which twisted farther around the beast's shell. They passed a place where the ground split, the shell showing skin far beneath. The rift was like a chasm; she couldn't have leaped from one side to the other without falling in. Reshi she passed on the path refused to respond to her questions. Fortunately, Kylrm knew the way, and when the path split, he pointed to the right fork. At times, the path leveled out for significant distances, but then there were always more steps. Her legs burning, her clothing damp with sweat, they reached the top of this flight andat long lastfound no more steps. Here, the jungle fell away completely, though rockbuds clutched the shell in the open fieldbeyond which was only the empty sky. The head, Rysn thought. We've climbed all the way to the beast's head. Soldiers lined the path, armed with spears bearing colorful tassels. Their breastplates and armguards were of carapace carved wickedly with points, and though they wore only wraps for clothing, they stood as stiffbacked as any Alethi soldier, with stern expressions to match. So her babsk was right. Not every Reshi was the "lounge and swim" type. Boldness, she thought to herself, remembering Vstim's words. She could not show these people a timid face. The king stood at the end of the pathway of guards and rockbuds, a diminutive figure on the edge of a carapace shelf, looking toward the sun. Rysn strode forward, passing through a double row of spears. She would have expected the same kind of clothing on the king, but instead the man wore full, voluminous robes of vibrant green and yellow. They looked terribly hot. As she drew nearer, Rysn got a sense for just how high she had climbed. The waters below shimmered in the sunlight, so far down that Rysn wouldn't have heard a rock hit if she'd dropped one. Far enough that looking over the side made her stomach twist upon itself and her legs tremble. Getting close to the king would require stepping out onto that shelf where he stood. It would place her within a breath of plummeting down hundreds and hundreds of feet. Steady, Rysn told herself. She would show her babsk that she was capable. She was not the ignorant girl who had misjudged the Shin or who had offended the Iriali. She had learned. Still, perhaps she should have asked Nlent to lend her his charm of courage. She stepped out onto the shelf. The king seemed young, at least from behind. Built like a youth, or . . . No, Rysn thought with a start as the king turned. It was a woman, old enough that her hair was greying, but not so old that she was bent with age. Someone stepped out onto the shelf behind Rysn. Younger, he wore the standard wrap and tassels. His hair was in two braids that fell over tan, bare shoulders. When he spoke, there wasn't even a hint of an accent to his voice. "The king wishes to know why his old trading partner, Vstim, has not come in person, and has instead sent a child in his place." "And are you the king?" Rysn asked the newcomer. The man laughed. "You stand beside him, yet ask that of me?" Rysn looked toward the robed figure. The robes were tied with the front open enough to show that the "king" definitely had breasts. "We are led by a king," the newcomer said. "Gender is irrelevant." It seemed to Rysn that gender was part of the definition, but it wasn't worth arguing over. "My master is indisposed," she said, addressing the newcomer he'd be the island's trademaster. "I am authorized to speak for him, and to accomplish the trade." The newcomer snorted, sitting down on the edge of the shelf, legs hanging out over the edge. Rysn's stomach did a somersault. "He should have known better. The trade is off, then." "You are Talik, I assume?" Rysn said, folding her arms. The man was no longer facing her. It seemed an intentional slight. "Yes." "My master warned me about you." "Then he isn't a complete fool," Talik said. "Just mostly." His pronunciation was astonishing. She found herself checking him for Thaylen eyebrows, but he was obviously Reshi. Rysn clenched her teeth, then forced herself to sit down beside him on the edge. She tried to do it as nonchalantly as he had, but she just couldn't. Instead, she settled downnot easy in a fashionable skirtand scooted out beside him. Oh, Passions! I'm going to fall off of this and die. Don't look down! Do not look down! She couldn't help it. She glanced downward, and felt immediately woozy. She could see the side of the head down there, the massive line of a jaw. Nearby, standing on a ridge above the eye to Rysn's right, people pushed large bundles of fruit off the side. Tied with vine rope, the bundles swung down beside the maw below. Mandibles moved slowly, pulling the fruit in, jerking the ropes. The Reshi pulled those back up to affix more fruit, all under the eyes of the king, who was supervising the feeding from the very tip of the nose to Rysn's left. "A treat," Talik said, noticing where she watched. "An offering. These small bundles of fruit, of course, do not sustain our god." "What does?" He smiled. "Why are you still here, young one? Did I not dismiss you?" "The trade does not have to be off," Rysn said. "My master told me the terms were already set. We have brought everything you require in payment." Though for what, I don't know. "Turning me aside would be pointless." The king, she noticed, had stepped closer to listen. "It would serve the same purpose as everything in life," Talik said. "To please Reluna." That would be the name of their god, the greatshell. "And your island would approve of such waste? Inviting traders all this way, only to send them off emptyhanded?" "Reluna approves of boldness," Talik said. "And, more importantly, respect. If we do not respect the one with whom we trade, then we should not do it." What ridiculous logic. If a merchant followed that line of reasoning, he'd never be able to trade. Except . . . in her months with Vstim, it seemed that he'd often sought out people who liked trading with him. People he respected. Those kinds of people certainly would be less likely to cheat you. Perhaps it wasn't bad logic . . . simply incomplete. Think like the other trader, she recalled. One of Vstim's lessonswhich were so different from the ones she'd learned at home. What do they want? Why do they want it? Why are you the best one to provide it? "It must be hard to live out here, in the waters," Rysn said. "Your god is impressive, but you cannot make everything you need for yourselves." "Our ancestors did it just fine." "Without medicines," Rysn said, "that could have saved lives. Without cloth from fibers that grow only on the mainland. Your ancestors survived without these things because they had to. You do not." The trademaster hunched forward. Don't do that! You'll fall! "We are not idiots," Talik said. Rysn frowned. Why "I'm so tired of explaining this," the man continued. "We live simply. That does not make us stupid. For years the outsiders came, trying to exploit us because of our ignorance. We are tired of it, woman. Everything you say is true. Not trueobvious. Yet you say it as if we'd never stopped to consider. 'Oh! Medicine! Of course we need medicine! Thank you for pointing that out. I was just going to sit here and die.'" Rysn blushed. "I didn't" "Yes, you did mean that," Talik said. "The condescension dripped from your lips, young lady. We're tired of being taken advantage of. We're tired of foreigners who try to trade us trash for riches. We don't have knowledge of the current economic situation on the mainland, so we can't know for certain if we are being cheated or not. Therefore, we trade only with people we know and trust. That is that." Current economic situation on the mainland . . . ? Rysn thought. "You've trained in Thaylenah," she guessed. "Of course I have," Talik said. "You have to know a predator's tricks before you can catch him." He settled back, which let her relax a little. "My parents sent me to train as a child. I had one of your babsks. I made trademaster on my own before returning here." "Your parents being the king and queen?" Rysn guessed again. He eyed her. "The king and king's consort." "You could just call her a queen." "This trade is not happening," Talik said, standing. "Go and tell your master we are sorry for his illness and hope that he recovers. If he does, he may return next year during the trading season and we will meet with him." "You imply you respect him," Rysn said, scrambling to her feetand away from that drop. "So just trade with him!" "He is sickly," Talik said, not looking at her. "It would not do him justice. We'd be taking advantage of him." Taking advantage of . . . Passions, these people were strange. It seemed even odder to hear such things coming from the mouth of a man who spoke such perfect Thaylen. "You'd trade with me if you respected me," Rysn said. "If you thought I was worthy of it." "That will take years," Talik said, joining his mother at the front of the shelf. "Go away, and" He cut off as the king spoke to him softly in Reshi. Talik drew his lips into a line. "What?" Rysn asked, stepping forward. Talik turned toward her. "You have apparently impressed the king. You argue fiercely. Though you dismiss us as primitives, you're not as bad as some." He ground his teeth for a moment. "The king will hear your argument for a trade." Rysn blinked, looked from one to the other. Hadn't she just made her argument for a trade, with the king listening? The woman regarded Rysn with dark eyes and a calm expression. I've won the first fight, Rysn realized, like the warriors on the battlefield. I've dueled and been judged worthy to spar with the one of greater authority. The king spoke, and Talik interpreted. "The king says that you are talented, but that the trade cannotof coursecontinue. You should return with your babsk when he comes again. In a decade or so, perhaps we will trade with you." Rysn searched for an argument. "And is that how Vstim gained respect, Your Majesty?" She would not fail in this. She couldn't! "Over years, with his own babsk?" "Yes," Talik said. "You didn't interpret that," Rysn said. "I . . ." Talik sighed, then interpreted her question. The king smiled with apparent fondness. She spoke a few words in their language, and Talik turned to his mother, looking shocked. "I . . . Wow." "What?" Rysn demanded. "Your babsk slew a coracot with some of our hunters," Talik said. "On his own? A foreigner? I had not heard of such a thing." Vstim. Slaying something? With hunters? Impossible. Though he obviously hadn't always been the wizened old ledgerworm that he was now, she'd imagined he'd been a wizened young ledgerworm in the past. The king spoke again. "I doubt you'll be slaying any beasts, child," Talik interpreted. "Go. Your babsk will recover from this. He is wise." No. He is dying, Rysn thought. It came to her mind unbidden, but the truth of it terrified her. More than the height, more than anything else she'd known. Vstim was dying. This might be his final trade. And she was ruining it. "My babsk trusts me," Rysn said, stepping closer to the king, moving along the greatshell's nose. "And you said you trust him. Can you not trust his judgment that I am worthy?" "One cannot substitute for personal experience," Talik translated. The beast stepped, ground trembling, and Rysn clenched her teeth, imagining them all toppling off. Fortunately, up this high, the motion was more like a gentle sway. Trees rustled, and her stomach lurched, but it wasn't any more dangerous than a ship surging on a wave. Rysn stepped closer to where the king stood beside the beast's nose. "You are kingyou know the importance of trusting those beneath you. You cannot be everywhere, know everything. At times, you must accept the judgment of those you know. My babsk is such a man." "You make a valid point," Talik translated, sounding surprised. "But what you do not realize is that I have already paid your babsk this respect. That is why I agreed to speak with you myself. I would not have done this for another." "But" "Return below," the king said through Talik, her voice growing harder. She seemed to think this was the end. "Tell your babsk that you proceeded far enough to speak with me personally. Doubtless, this is more than he expected. You may leave the island, and return when he is well." "I . . ." Rysn felt as if a fist were crushing her throat, making it hard for her to speak. She couldn't fail him, not now. "Give him my best wishes for his recovery," the king said, turning away. Talik smiled in what seemed to be satisfaction. Rysn glanced at her two guards, who bore grim expressions. Rysn stepped away. She felt numb. Turned away, like a child demanding sweets. She felt a furious blush consume her as she walked past the men and women preparing more bundles of fruit. Rysn stopped. She looked to her left, out at the endless expanse of blue. She turned back toward the king. "I believe," Rysn said loudly, "that I need to speak with someone with more authority." Talik turned toward her. "You have spoken to the king. There is nobody with more authority." "I beg your pardon," Rysn said. "But I do think there is." One of the ropes shook from having its fruit gift consumed. This is stupid, this is stupid, this is Don't think. Rysn scrambled to the rope, causing her guards to cry out. She grabbed the length of rope and let herself over the side, climbing down beside the greatshell's head. The god's head. Passions! This was hard in a skirt. The rope bit into the skin of her arms, and it vibrated as the creature below crunched on the fruit upon its end. Talik's head appeared above. "What in Kelek's name are you doing, idiot woman?" he screamed. She found it amusing that he'd learned their curses while studying with them. Rysn clung to the rope, heart rushing in a mad panic. What was she doing? "Reluna," she yelled back at Talik, "approves of boldness!" "There is a difference between boldness and stupidity!" Rysn continued to climb down. It was more of a slide. Oh, Craving, Passion of need . . . "Pull her back up!" Talik ordered. "You soldiers, help." He gave further orders in Reshi. Rysn looked up as workers grabbed the rope to haul her back upward. A new face appeared above, however, looking down. The king. She raised a hand, halting them as she studied Rysn. Rysn continued on down. She didn't go terribly far, maybe fifty feet or so. Not even down to the creature's eye. She stopped herself, with effort, her fingers burning. "O great Reluna," Rysn said loudly, "your people refuse to trade with me, and so I come to you to beg. Your people need what I have brought, but I need a trade even more. I cannot afford to return." The creature, of course, did not reply. Rysn hung in place beside its shell, which was crusted with lichen and small rockbuds. "Please," Rysn said. "Please." What am I expecting to happen? Rysn wondered. She didn't expect the thing to make any sort of reply. But maybe she could persuade those above that she was bold enough to be worthy. It couldn't hurt, at least. The rope quivered in her hands, and she made the mistake of glancing down. Actually, what she was doing could hurt. Very much. "The king," Talik said above, "has commanded that you return." "Will our negotiation continue?" Rysn asked, glancing up. The king actually looked concerned. "That's not important," Talik said. "You have been issued a command." Rysn gritted her teeth, clinging to the rope, looking at the plates of chitin before her. "And what do you think?" she asked softly. Down below, the thing bit down, and the rope suddenly became very tight, slapping Rysn against the side of the enormous head. Above, workers shouted. The king yelled at them in a sudden, sharp voice. Oh no . . . The rope pulled even tighter. Then snapped. The shouts grew frantic above, though Rysn barely noticed them as panic struck. She did not fall gracefully, but as a flurry of screaming cloth and legs, her skirt flapping, her stomach lurching. What had she done? She She saw an eye. The god's eye. Only a glimpse as she passed; it was as large as a house, glassy and black, and it reflected her falling form. She seemed to hang before it for a fraction of a second, and her scream died in her throat. It was gone in a moment. Then rushing wind, another scream, and a crash into water hard as stone. Blackness. * * * Rysn found herself floating when she awoke. She didn't open her eyes, but she could sense that she was floating. Drifting, bobbing up and down . . . "She is an idiot." She knew that voice. Talik, the one she'd been trading with. "Then she fits well with me," Vstim said. He coughed. "I have to say, old friend, you were supposed to help train her, not drop her off a cliff." Floating . . . Drifting . . . Wait. Rysn forced her eyes open. She was in a bed inside a hut. It was hot. Her vision swam, and she drifted . . . drifted because her mind was cloudy. What had they given her? She tried to sit up. Her legs wouldn't move. Her legs wouldn't move. She gasped, then began breathing quickly. Vstim's face appeared above her, followed by a concerned Reshi woman with ribbons in her hair. Not the queen . . . king . . . whatever. This woman spoke quickly in the barking language of the Reshi. "Calm now," Vstim said to Rysn, kneeling beside her. "Calm . . . They'll get you something to drink, child." "I lived," Rysn said. Her voice rasped as she spoke. "Barely," Vstim said, though with fondness. "The spren cushioned your fall. From that height . . . Child, what were you thinking, climbing over the side like that?" "I needed to do something," Rysn said. "To prove courage. I thought . . . I needed to be bold . . ." "Oh, child. This is my fault." "You were his babsk," Rysn said. "Talik, their trader. You set this up with him, so I could have a chance to trade on my own, but in a controlled setting. The trade was never in danger, and you are not as sick as you appear." The words boiled out, tumbling over one another like a hundred men trying to leave through the same doorway at once. "When did you figure that out?" Vstim asked, then coughed. "I . . ." She didn't know. It just all kind of fell together for her. "Right now." "Well, you must know that I feel a true fool," Vstim said. "I thought this would be a perfect chance for you. A practice with real stakes. And then . . . Then you went and fell off the island's head!" Rysn squeezed her eyes shut as the Reshi woman arrived with a cup of something. "Will I walk again?" Rysn asked softly. "Here, drink this," Vstim said. "Will I walk again?" She didn't take the cup, and kept her eyes closed. "I don't know," Vstim said. "But you will trade again. Passions! Daring to go above the king's authority? Being saved by the island's soul itself?" He chuckled. It sounded forced. "The other islands will be clamoring to trade with us." "Then I accomplished something," she said, feeling a complete and utter idiot. "Oh, you accomplished something indeed," Vstim said. She felt a prickling pressure on her arm and opened her eyes with a snap. Something crawled there, about as big as the palm of her handa creature that looked like a cremling, but with wings that folded along the back. "What is it?" Rysn demanded. "Why we came here," Vstim said. "The thing we trade for, a treasure that very few know still exists. They were supposed to have died with Aimia, you see. I came here with all of these goods in tow because Talik sent to me to say they had the corpse of one to trade. Kings pay fortunes for them." He leaned down. "I have never seen one alive before. I was given the corpse I wanted in trade. This one has been given to you." "By the Reshi?" Rysn asked, mind still clouded. She didn't know what to make of any of this. "The Reshi could not command one of the larkin," Vstim said, standing. "This was given you by the island itself. Now drink your medicine and sleep. You shattered both of your legs. We will be staying on this island for a long while as you recover, and as I seek forgiveness for being a foolish, foolish man." She accepted the drink. As she drank, the small creature flew up toward the rafters of the hut and perched there, looking down at her with eyes of solid silver. "So what kind of spren is it?" Thude asked to the slow Rhythm of Curiosity. He held up the gemstone, peering in at the smoky creature moving about inside. "Stormspren, my sister says," Eshonai replied as she leaned against the wall, arms folded. The strands of Thude's beard were tied with bits of raw gemstone that shook and twinkled as he rubbed his chin. He held the large cut gemstone up to Bila, who took it and tapped it with her finger. They were a warpair of Eshonai's own personal division. They dressed in simple garments that were tailored around the chitinous armor plates on their arms, legs, and chests. Thude also wore a long coat, but he wouldn't take that to battle. Eshonai, by contrast, wore her uniformtight red cloth that stretched over her natural armorand a cap on her skullplate. She never spoke of how that uniform imprisoned her, felt like manacles that tied her in place. "A stormspren," Bila said to the Rhythm of Skepticism as she turned the stone over in her fingers. "Will it help me kill humans? Otherwise, I don't see why I should care." "This could change the world, Bila," Eshonai said. "If Venli is right, and she can bond with this spren and come out with anything other than dullform . . . well, at the very least we will have an entirely new form to choose. At the greatest we will have power to control the storms and tap their energy." "So she will try this personally?" Thude asked to the Rhythm of Winds, the rhythm that they used to judge when a highstorm was near. "If the Five give her permission." They were to discuss it, and make their decision, today. "That's great," Bila said, "but will it help me kill humans?" Eshonai attuned Mourning. "If stormform is truly one of the ancient powers, Bila, then yes. It will help you kill humans. Many of them." "Good enough for me, then," Bila said. "Why are you so worried?" "The ancient powers are said to have come from our gods." "Who cares? If the gods would help us kill those armies out there, then I'd swear to them right now." "Don't say that, Bila," Eshonai said to Reprimand. "Never say anything like that." The woman quieted, tossing the stone onto the table. She hummed softly to Skepticism. That walked the line of insubordination. Eshonai met Bila's eyes and found herself softly humming to Resolve. Thude glanced from Bila to Eshonai. "Food?" he asked. "Is that your answer to every disagreement?" Eshonai asked, breaking her song. "It's hard to argue with your mouth full," Thude said. "I'm sure I've seen you do just that," Bila said. "Many times." "The arguments end happy, though," Thude said. "Because everyone is full. So . . . food?" "Fine," Bila said, glancing at Eshonai. The two withdrew. Eshonai sat down at the table, feeling drained. When had she started worrying if her friends were insubordinate? It was this horrid uniform. She picked up the gemstone, staring into its depths. It was a large one, about a third the size of her fist, though gemstones didn't have to be large to trap a spren inside. She hated trapping them. The right way was to go into the highstorm with the proper attitude, singing the proper song to attract the proper spren. You bonded it in the fury of the raging storm and were reborn with a new body. People had been doing this from the arrival of the first winds. The listeners had learned that capturing spren was possible from the humans, then had figured out the process on their own. A captive spren made the transformation much more reliable. Before, there had always been an element of chance. You could go into the storm wanting to become a soldier, and come out a mate instead. This is progress, Eshonai thought, staring at the little smoky spren inside the stone. Progress is learning to control your world. Put up walls to stop the storms, choose when to become a mate. Progress was taking nature and putting a box around it. Eshonai pocketed the gemstone, and checked the time. Her meeting with the rest of the Five wasn't scheduled until the third movement of the Rhythm of Peace, and she had a good half a movement until then. It was time to speak with her mother. Eshonai stepped out into Narak and walked along the path, nodding to those who saluted. She passed mostly soldiers. So much of their population wore warform these days. Their small population. Once, there had been hundreds of thousands of listeners scattered across these plains. Now a fraction remained. Even then, the listeners had been a united people. Oh, there had been divisions, conflicts, even wars among their factions. But they had been a single peoplethose who had rejected their gods and sought freedom in obscurity. Bila no longer cared about their origins. There would be others like her, people who ignored the danger of the gods and focused only on the fight with the humans. Eshonai passed dwellingsramshackle things constructed of hardened crem over frames of shell, huddled in the leeward shadow of lumps of stone. Most of those were empty now. They'd lost thousands to war over the years. We do have to do something, she thought, attuning the Rhythm of Peace in the back of her mind. She sought comfort in its calm, soothing beats, soft and blended. Like a caress. Then she saw the dullforms. They looked much like what the humans called "parshmen," though they were a little taller and not nearly as stupid. Still, dullform was a limiting form, without the capacities and advantages of newer forms. There shouldn't have been any here. Had these people bonded the wrong spren by mistake? It happened sometimes. Eshonai strode up to the group of three, two femalen and one malen. They were hauling rockbuds harvested on one of the nearby plateaus, plants which had been encouraged to grow quickly by use of Stormlightinfused gems. "What is this?" Eshonai asked. "Did you choose this form in error? Or are you new spies?" They looked at her with insipid eyes. Eshonai attuned Anxiety. She had once tried dullformshe had wanted to know what their spies would suffer. Trying to force concepts through her brain had been like trying to think rationally while in a dream. "Did someone ask you to adopt this form?" Eshonai said, speaking slowly and clearly. "Nobody asked it," the malen said to no rhythm at all. His voice sounded dead. "We did it." "Why?" Eshonai said. "Why would you do this?" "Humans won't kill us when they come," the malen said, hefting his rockbud and continuing on his way. The others joined him without a word. Eshonai gaped, the Rhythm of Anxiety strong in her mind. A few fearspren, like long purple worms, dove in and out of the rock nearby, collecting toward her until they crawled up out of the ground around her. Forms could not be commanded; every person was free to choose for themselves. Transformations could be cajoled and requested, but they could not be forced. Their gods had not allowed this freedom, so the listeners would have it, no matter what. These people could choose dullform if they wished. Eshonai could do nothing about it. Not directly. She hastened her pace. Her leg still ached from her wound, but was healing quickly. One of the benefits of warform. She could almost ignore the damage at this point. A city full of empty buildings, and Eshonai's mother chose a shack on the very edge of the city, almost fully exposed to the storms. Mother worked her shalebark rows outside, humming softly to herself to the Rhythm of Peace. She wore workform; she'd always preferred it. Even after nimbleform had been discovered, Mother had not changed. She had said she didn't want to encourage people to see one form as more valuable than another, that such stratification could destroy them. Wise words. The type Eshonai hadn't heard out of her mother in years. "Child!" Mother said as Eshonai approached. Solid despite her years, Mother had a neat round face and wore her hairstrands in a braid, tied with a ribbon. Eshonai had brought her that ribbon from a meeting with the Alethi years ago. "Child, have you seen your sister? It is her day of first transformation! We need to prepare her." "It is attended to, Mother," Eshonai said to the Rhythm of Peace, kneeling down beside the woman. "How goes the pruning?" "I should be finishing soon," Mother said. "I need to leave before the people who own this house return." "You own it, Mother." "No, no. It belongs to two others. They were in the house last night, and told me I needed to leave. I'll just finish with this shalebark before I go." She got out her file, smoothing one side of a ridge, then painting it with sap to encourage growth in that direction. Eshonai sat back, attuning Mourning, and Peace left her. Perhaps she should have chosen the Rhythm of the Lost instead. It changed in her head. She forced it back. No. No, her mother was not dead. She wasn't fully alive, either. "Here, take this," Mother said to Peace, handing Eshonai a file. At least Mother recognized her today. "Work on that outcropping there. I don't want it to keep growing downward. We need to send it up, up toward the light." "The storms are too strong on this side of the city." "Storms? Nonsense. No storms here." Mother paused. "I wonder where we'll be taking your sister. She'll need a storm for her transformation." "Don't worry about that, Mother," Eshonai said, forcing herself to speak to Peace. "I will care for it." "You are so good, Venli," Mother said. "So helpful. Staying home, not running off, like your sister. That girl . . . She's never where she should be." "She is now," Eshonai whispered. "She's trying to be." Mother hummed to herself, continuing working. Once, this woman had one of the best memories in the city. She still did, in a way. "Mother," Eshonai said, "I need help. I think something terrible is going to happen. I can't decide if it is less terrible than what is already happening." Mother filed at a section of shalebark, then blew off the dust. "Our people are crumbling," Eshonai said. "We're being weathered away. We moved to Narak and chose a war of attrition. That has meant six years with steady losses. People are giving up." "That's not good," Mother said. "But the alternative? Dabbling in things we shouldn't, things that might bring the eyes of the Unmade upon us." "You're not working," Mother said, pointing. "Don't be like your sister." Eshonai placed her hands in her lap. This wasn't helping. Seeing Mother like this . . . "Mother," Eshonai said to Supplication, "why did we leave the dark home?" "Ah, now that's an old song, Eshonai," Mother said. "A dark song, not for a child like you. Why, it's not even your day of first transformation." "I'm old enough, Mother. Please?" Mother blew on her shalebark. Had she forgotten, finally, this last part of what she had been? Eshonai's heart sank. "Long are the days since we knew the dark home," Mother sang softly to one of the Rhythms of Remembrance. "The Last Legion, that was our name then. Warriors who had been set to fight in the farthest plains, this place that had once been a nation and was now rubble. Dead was the freedom of most people. The forms, unknown, were forced upon us. Forms of power, yes, but also forms of obedience. The gods commanded, and we did obey, always. Always." "Except for that day," Eshonai said along with her mother, in rhythm. "The day of the storm when the Last Legion fled," Mother continued in song. "Difficult was the path chosen. Warriors, touched by the gods, our only choice to seek dullness of mind. A crippling that brought freedom." Mother's calm, sonorous song danced with the wind. As frail as she seemed other times, when she sang the old songs, she seemed herself again. A parent who had at times conflicted with Eshonai, but a parent whom Eshonai had always respected. "Daring was the challenge made," Mother sang, "when the Last Legion abandoned thought and power in exchange for freedom. They risked forgetting all. And so songs they composed, a hundred stories to tell, to remember. I tell them to you, and you will tell them to your children, until the forms are again discovered." From there, Mother launched into one of the early songs, about how the people would make their home in the ruins of an abandoned kingdom. How they would spread out, act as simple tribes and refugees. It was their plan to remain hidden, or at least ignored. The songs left out so much. The Last Legion hadn't known how to transform into anything other than dullform and mateform, at least not without the help of the gods. How had they known the other forms were possible? Had these facts originally been recorded in the songs, and then lost over the years as words changed here and there? Eshonai listened, and though her mother's voice did help her attune Peace again, she found herself deeply troubled anyway. She had come here for answers. Once, that would have worked. No longer. Eshonai stood to leave her mother singing. "I found some of your things," Mother said, breaking the song, "when cleaning today. You should take them. They clutter the home, and I will be moving out soon." Eshonai hummed Mourning to herself, but went to see just what her mother had "discovered." Another pile of rocks, in which she saw child's playthings? Strips of cloth she imagined were clothing? Eshonai found a small sack in front of the building. She opened it to find paper. Paper made from local plants, not human paper. Rough paper, with varied color, made after the old listener way. Textured and full, not neat and sterile. The ink on it was beginning to fade, but Eshonai recognized the drawings. My maps, she thought. From those early days. Without meaning to, she attuned Remembrance. Days spent hiking across the wilderness of what the humans called Natanatan, passing through forests and jungles, drawing her own maps and expanding the world. She'd started alone, but her discoveries had excited an entire people. Soon, though still in her teenage years, she'd been leading entire expeditions to find new rivers, new ruins, new spren, new plants. And humans. In a way, this was all her fault. Her mother started singing again. Looking through her old maps, Eshonai found a powerful longing within her. Once, she'd seen the world as something fresh and exciting. New, like a blossoming forest after a storm. She was dying slowly, as surely as her people were. She packed up the maps and left her mother's house, walking toward the center of town. Her mother's song, still beautiful, echoed behind her. Eshonai attuned Peace. That let her know that she was nearly late for the meeting with the rest of the Five. She did not hasten her pace. She let the steady, sweeping beats of the Rhythm of Peace carry her forward. Unless you concentrated on attuning a certain rhythm, your body would naturally choose the one that fit your mood. Therefore, it was always a conscious decision to listen to a rhythm that did not match how you felt. She did this now with Peace. The listeners had made a decision centuries ago, a decision that set them back to primitive levels. Choosing to murder Gavilar Kholin had been an act to affirm that decision of their ancestors. Eshonai had not then been one of their leaders, but they had listened to her counsel and given her the right to vote among them. The choice, horrible though it seemed, had been one of courage. They'd hoped that a long war would bore the Alethi. Eshonai and the others had underestimated Alethi greed. The gemhearts had changed everything. In the center of town, near the pool, was a tall tower that remained proudly erect in defiance of centuries' worth of storms. Once, there had been steps within, but crem leaking in windows had filled the building up with rock. So workers had carved steps running around its outside. Eshonai started up the steps, holding to the chain for safety. It was a long but familiar climb. Though her leg ached, warform had great endurancethough it required more food than any other form to keep it strong. She made it to the top with ease. She found the other members of the Five waiting for her, one member wearing each known form. Eshonai for warform, Davim for workform, Abronai for mateform, Chivi for nimbleform, and the quiet Zuln for dullform. Venli waited as well, with her oncemate, though he was flushed from the difficult climb. Nimbleform, though good for many delicate activities, did not have great endurance. Eshonai stepped up onto the flat top of the oncetower, wind blowing against her from the east. There were no chairs up here, and the Five sat on the bare rock itself. Davim hummed to Annoyance. With the rhythms in one's head, it was difficult to be late by accident. They rightly suspected that Eshonai had dallied. She sat on the rock and took the sprenfilled gemstone from her pocket, setting it on the ground in front of her. The violet stone glowed with Stormlight. "I am worried about this test," Eshonai said. "I do not think we should allow it to proceed." "What?" Venli said to Anxiety. "Sister, don't be ridiculous. Our people need this." Davim leaned forward, arms on his knees. He was broad faced, his workform skin marbled mostly of black with tiny swirls of red here and there. "If this works, it will be an amazing advance. The first of the forms of ancient power, rediscovered." "Those forms are tied to the gods," Eshonai said. "What if, in choosing this form, we invite them to return?" Venli hummed Irritation. "In the old day, all forms came from the gods. We have found that nimbleform does not harm us. Why would stormform?" "It is different," Eshonai said. "Sing the song; hum it to yourself. 'Its coming brings the gods their night.' The ancient powers are dangerous." "Men have them," Abronai said. He wore mateform, lush and plump, though he controlled its passions. Eshonai had never envied him the position; she knew, from private conversations, that he would have preferred to have another form. Unfortunately, others who held mateform either did so transientlyor did not possess the proper solemnity to join the Five. "You yourself brought us the report, Eshonai," Abronai continued. "You saw a warrior among the Alethi using ancient powers, and many others confirmed it to us. Surgebindings have returned to men. The spren again betray us." "If Surgebindings are back," Davim said to Consideration, "then it might indicate that the gods are returning anyway. If so, we'd best be prepared to deal with them. Forms of power will help with that." "We don't know they will come," Eshonai said to Resolve. "We don't know any of this. Who knows if men even have Surgebindingsit might be one of the Honorblades. We left one in Alethkar that night." Chivi hummed to Skepticism. Her nimbleform face had elongated features, her hairstrands tied back in a long tail. "We are fading as a people. I passed some today who had taken dullform, and not to remember our past. They did so because they worried that men would kill them otherwise! They prepare themselves to become slaves!" "I saw them too," Davim said to Resolve. "We must do something, Eshonai. Your soldiers are losing this war, beat by beat." "The next storm," Venli said. She used the Rhythm of Pleading. "I can test this at the next storm." Eshonai closed her eyes. Pleading. It was a rhythm not often attuned. It was hard to deny her sister in this. "We must be unified in this decision," Davim said. "I will accept nothing else. Eshonai, do you insist on objecting? Will we need to spend hours here making this decision?" She took a deep breath, coming to a decision that had been working its way through the back of her mind. The decision of an explorer. She glanced at the sack of maps she'd set on the floor beside her. "I will agree to this test," Eshonai said. Nearby, Venli hummed to Appreciation. "However," Eshonai continued to Resolve, "I must be the one who tries the new form first." All humming stopped. The others of the Five gaped at her. "What?" Venli said. "Sister, no! It is my right." "You are too valuable," Eshonai said. "You know too much about the forms, and much of your research is held only in your head. I am simply a soldier. I can be spared if this goes wrong." "You are a Shardbearer," Davim said. "Our last." "Thude has trained with my Blade and Plate," Eshonai said. "I will leave both with him, just in case." The others of the Five hummed to Consideration. "This is a good suggestion," Abronai said. "Eshonai has both strength and experience." "It was my discovery!" Venli said to Irritation. "And you are appreciated for it," Davim said. "But Eshonai is right; you and your scholars are too important to our future." "More than that," Abronai added. "You are too close to the project, Venli. The way you speak makes that clear. If Eshonai enters the storms and discovers that something is off about this form, she can halt the experiment and return to us." "This is a good compromise," Chivi said, nodding. "Are we in agreement?" "I believe so," Abronai said, turning toward Zuln. The representative of the dullforms rarely spoke. She wore the smock of a parshman, and had indicated that she considered it her duty to represent them those with no songsalong with any dullforms among them. Hers was as noble a sacrifice as Abronai holding to mateform. More so. Dullform was a difficult form to suffer, one that only a few ever experienced for longer than a stormpause or so. "I agree to this," Zuln said. The others hummed to Appreciation. Only Venli did not join in the song. If this stormform turned out to be real, would they add another person to the Five? At first, the Five had all been dullforms, then all workers. It was only at the discovery of nimbleform that it had been decided that they would have one of each form. A question for later. The others of the Five stood up, then began to make their way down the long flight of steps spiraling around the tower. Wind blew from the east, and Eshonai turned toward it, looking out over the broken Plains toward the Origin of Storms. During a coming highstorm, she would step into the winds and become something new. Something powerful. Something that would change the destiny of the listeners, and perhaps the humans, forever. "I nearly had cause to hate you, Sister," Venli said to Reprimand, idling beside where Eshonai sat. "I did not forbid this test," Eshonai said. "Instead you take its glory." "If there is glory to be had," Eshonai said to Reprimand, "it will be yours for discovering the form. That should not be a consideration. Only our future should matter." Venli hummed to Irritation. "They called you wise, experienced. It makes one wonder if they've forgotten who you werethat you went off recklessly into the wilds, ignoring your people, while I stayed home and memorized songs. When did everyone start believing you were the responsible one?" It's this cursed uniform, Eshonai thought, rising. "Why didn't you tell us what you were researching? You let me believe your studies were to find artform or mediationform. Instead, you were looking for one of the forms of ancient power." "Does that matter?" "Yes. It makes all the difference, Venli. I love you, but your ambition frightens me." "You don't trust me," Venli said to Betrayal. Betrayal. That was a song rarely sung. It stung enough to make Eshonai wince. "We'll see what this form does," Eshonai said, picking up her maps and the gemstone with the trapped spren. "Then we will talk further. I just want to be careful." "You want to do it yourself," Venli said to Irritation. "You always want to be first. But enough. It is done. Come with me; I will need to train you in the proper mindset to help the form work. Then we will pick a highstorm for the transformation." Eshonai nodded. She would go through this training. In the meantime, she would consider. Perhaps there was another way. If she could get the Alethi to listen to her, find Dalinar Kholin, sue for peace . . . Perhaps then, this would not be needed. Warform is worn for battle and reign, Claimed by the gods, given to kill. Unknown, unseen, but vital to gain. It comes to those with the will. From the Listener Song of Listing, 15th stanza The wagon rattled and shook its way across the stone ground, Shallan perched on the hard seat next to Bluth, one of the slabfaced mercenaries Tvlakv employed. He guided the chull pulling the wagon, and didn't speak much, though when he thought she wasn't looking, he would inspect her with eyes like beads of dark glass. It was chilly. She wished the weather would turn, and springor even summerwould come for a time. That wasn't likely in a place notorious for its permanent chill. Having improvised a blanket from the lining of Jasnah's trunk, Shallan draped it over her knees and down to her feet, as much to obscure how tattered her skirt had become as against the cold. She tried to distract herself by studying the surroundings; the flora out here in the southern Frostlands was completely unfamiliar to her. If there was grass, it grew in patches along the leeward sides of rocks, with short spiky blades rather than long, waving ones. The rockbuds never grew larger than a fist, and they didn't open all the way, even when she'd tried pouring water on one. Their vines were lazy and slow, as if numbed by the cold. There were also spindly little shrubs that grew in cracks and along hillsides. Their brittle branches scraped the sides of the wagon, their tiny green leaves the size of raindrops folding and pulling into the stalks. The shrubs grew prolifically, spreading wherever they could find purchase. As the wagon rolled past a particularly tall clump, Shallan reached out and snapped off a branch. It was tubular, with an open center, and felt rough like sand. "These are too fragile for highstorms," Shallan said, holding it up. "How does this plant survive?" Bluth grunted. "It is common, Bluth," Shallan said, "to engage one's traveling companion in mutually diverting dialogue." "I'd do that," he said darkly, "if I knew what in Damnation half those words meant." Shallan started. She honestly hadn't expected a response. "Then we are even," she said, "as you use plenty of words I don't know. Admittedly, I think most of them are curses. . . ." She'd meant it lightheartedly, but his expression only darkened further. "You think I'm as dumb as that stick." Stop insulting my stick. The words came to her mind, and almost to her lips, unbidden. She should have been better at holding her tongue, considering her upbringing. But freedomwithout the fear that her father was looming behind every closed doorhad severely diminished her selfcontrol. She suppressed the taunt this time. "Stupidity is a function of one's surroundings," she said instead. "You're saying I'm dumb because I was raised that way?" "No. I'm saying that everyone is stupid in some situations. After my ship was lost, I found myself ashore but unable to make a fire to warm myself. Would you say that I'm stupid?" He shot her a glance, but did not speak. Perhaps to a darkeyes, that question sounded like a trap. "Well I am," Shallan said. "In many areas, I'm stupid. Perhaps when it comes to large words, you're stupid. That's why we need both scholars and caravan workers, guardsman Bluth. Our stupidities complement one another." "I can see why we need fellows who know how to light fires," Bluth said. "But I don't see why we need people to use fancy words." "Shhhh," Shallan said. "Don't say that so loudly. If the lighteyes hear, they might stop wasting their time making up new words, and instead start interfering with the business of honest men." He glanced at her again. Not even a glimmer of humor in the eyes beneath that thick brow. Shallan sighed, but turned her attention back to the plants. How did they survive highstorms? She should get out her sketchpad and No. She blanked her mind and let it go. A short time later, Tvlakv called the midday halt. Shallan's wagon slowed, and one of the others pulled up beside it. Tag drove this one, with the two parshmen sitting in the cage behind, working quietly at weaving hats from reeds they'd gathered in the morning. People often ordered parshmen to do such menial worksomething to make sure all of their time was spent earning money for those who owned them. Tvlakv would sell the hats for a few chips at his destination. They kept working as the wagon stopped. They would have to be told to do something else, and had to be trained specifically for each job they did. But once they were trained, they would work without complaint. Shallan had difficulty not seeing their quiet obedience as something pernicious. She shook her head, then held out her hand to Bluth, who helped her from the wagon without further prodding. On the ground, she rested her hand on the side of the vehicle and breathed in sharply through her teeth. Stormfather, what had she done to her feet? Painspren wiggled out of the wall beside her, little orange bits of sinewlike hands with the flesh removed. "Brightness?" Tvlakv said, waddling her direction. "I'm afraid we haven't much to offer you in the way of meals. We are poor for merchants, you see, and cannot afford delicacies." "Whatever you have will suffice," Shallan said, trying to keep the pain from showing in her face, though the spren had already given her away. "Please have one of your men get down my trunk." Tvlakv did so without complaint, though he watched hungrily as Bluth lowered it to the ground. It seemed a particularly bad idea to let him see what was inside; the less information he had, the better off she would be. "These cages," Shallan said, looking over the back of her wagon, "from those clasps at top, it looks like the wooden sides can be affixed over the bars." "Yes, Brightness," Tvlakv said. "For highstorms, you see." "You only have enough slaves to fill one of the three wagons," Shallan said. "And the parshmen ride in another. This one is empty, and will make an excellent traveling wagon for me. Put the sides on." "Brightness?" he said with surprise. "You want to be put into the cage?" "Why not?" Shallan asked, meeting his eyes. "Certainly I'm safe in your custody, tradesman Tvlakv." "Er . . . yes . . ." "You and your men must be well acquainted with rough travel," Shallan said calmly, "but I am not. Sitting day in and out in the sun on a hard bench will not suit me. A proper carriage, however, would be a welcome amelioration of this wilderness journey." "Carriage?" Tvlakv said. "It's a slave wagon!" "Mere words, tradesman Tvlakv," Shallan said. "If you please?" He sighed, but gave the order, and the men pulled the sides out from beneath the wagon and hooked them up on the outside. They left off the back one, where the cage door was. The result did not look especially comfortable, but it would offer some privacy. Shallan had Bluth haul her chest up and inside, to Tvlakv's dismay. Then, she climbed in and pulled the cage door shut. She held her hand out through the bars toward Tvlakv. "Brightness?" "The key," she said. "Oh." He pulled it out of a pocket, regarding it for a momenttoo long a momentbefore handing it to her. "Thank you," she replied. "You may send Bluth with my meal when it is ready, but I shall require a bucket of clean water immediately. You have been most accommodating. I will not forget your service." "Er . . . Thank you." It almost sounded like a question, and as he walked away, he seemed confused. Good. She waited for Bluth to bring the water, then crawledto stay off her feet through the enclosed wagon. It stank of dirt and sweat, and she grew nauseated thinking of the slaves who had been held here. She would ask Bluth to have the parshmen scrub it later. She stopped before Jasnah's trunk, then knelt and gingerly raised the lid. Light spilled out from the infused spheres inside. Pattern waited there as wellshe had instructed him not to be seenhis shape raising the cover of a book. Shallan had survived, so far. She certainly wasn't safe, but at least she wasn't going to freeze or starve immediately. That meant she finally had to face greater questions and problems. She rested her hand on the books, ignoring her throbbing feet for the moment. "These have to reach the Shattered Plains." Pattern vibrated with a confused sounda questioning pitch that implied curiosity. "Someone needs to continue Jasnah's work," Shallan said. "Urithiru must be found, and the Alethi must be convinced that the return of the Voidbringers is imminent." She shivered, thinking of the marbled parshmen working just one wagon over. "You . . . mmm . . . continue?" Pattern asked. "Yes." She'd made that decision the moment she'd insisted that Tvlakv head for the Shattered Plains. "That night before the sinking, when I saw Jasnah with her guard down . . . I know what I must do." Pattern hummed, again sounding confused. "It's hard to explain," Shallan said. "It's a human thing." "Excellent," Pattern said, eager. She raised an eyebrow toward him. He'd quickly come a long way from spending hours spinning in the center of a room or climbing up and down walls. Shallan took out some spheres for better light, then removed one of the cloths Jasnah had wrapped around her books. It was immaculately clean. Shallan dipped the cloth into the bucket of water and began to wash her feet. "Before I saw Jasnah's expression that night," she explained, "before I talked to her through her fatigue and got a sense of just how worried she was, I had fallen into a trap. The trap of a scholar. Despite my initial horror at what Jasnah had described about the parshmen, I had come to see it all as an intellectual puzzle. Jasnah was so outwardly dispassionate that I assumed she did the same." Shallan winced as she dug a bit of rock from a crack in her foot. More painspren wiggled out of the floor of the wagon. She wouldn't be walking great distances anytime soon, but at least she didn't see any rotspren yet. She had better find some antiseptic. "Our danger isn't just theoretical, Pattern. It is real and it is terrible." "Yes," Pattern said, voice sounding grave. She looked up from her feet. He had moved up onto the inside of the chest's lid, lit by the varied light of the differently colored spheres. "You know something about the danger? The parshmen, the Voidbringers?" Perhaps she was reading too much into his tones. He wasn't human, and often spoke with strange inflections. "My return . . ." Pattern said. "Because of this." "What? Why haven't you said something!" "Say . . . speaking . . . Thinking . . . All hard. Getting better." "You came to me because of the Voidbringers," Shallan said, moving closer to the trunk, bloodied rag forgotten in her hand. "Yes. Patterns . . . we . . . us . . . Worry. One was sent. Me." "Why to me?" "Because of lies." She shook her head. "I don't understand." He buzzed in dissatisfaction. "You. Your family." "You watched me with my family? That long ago?" "Shallan. Remember . . ." Again those memories. This time, not a garden seat, but a sterile white room. Her father's lullaby. Blood on the floor. No. She turned away and began cleaning her feet again. "I know . . . little of humans," Pattern said. "They break. Their minds break. You did not break. Only cracked." She continued her washing. "It is the lies that save you," Pattern said. "The lies that drew me." She dipped her rag in the bucket. "Do you have a name? I've called you Pattern, but it's more of a description." "Name is numbers," Pattern said. "Many numbers. Hard to say. Pattern . . . Pattern is fine." "As long as you don't start calling me Erratic as a contrast," Shallan said. "Mmmmmm . . ." "What does that mean?" she asked. "I am thinking," Pattern said. "Considering the lie." "The joke?" "Yes." "Please don't think too hard," Shallan said. "It wasn't a particularly good joke. If you want to ponder a real one, consider that stopping the return of the Voidbringers might depend on me, of all people." "Mmmmm . . ." She finished with her feet as best she could, then wrapped them with several other cloths from the trunk. She had no slippers or shoes. Perhaps she could buy an extra pair of boots from one of the slavers? The mere thought made her stomach churn, but she didn't have a choice. Next, she sorted through the contents of the trunk. This was only one of Jasnah's trunks, but Shallan recognized it as the one the woman kept in her own cabinthe one the assassins had taken. It contained Jasnah's notes: books and books full of them. The trunk contained few primary sources, but that didn't matter, as Jasnah had meticulously transcribed all relevant passages. As Shallan set aside the last book, she noticed something on the bottom of the trunk. A loose piece of paper? She picked it up, curiousthen nearly dropped it in surprise. It was a picture of Jasnah, drawn by Shallan herself. Shallan had given it to the woman after being accepted as her ward. She'd assumed Jasnah had thrown it awaythe woman had little fondness for visual arts, which she considered a frivolity. Instead, she'd kept it here with her most precious things. No. Shallan didn't want to think about that, didn't want to face it. "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. "You cannot keep all lies. Only the most important." Shallan reached up and found tears in her eyes. For Jasnah. She'd been avoiding the grief, had stuffed it into a little box and set it away. As soon as she let that grief come, another piled on top of it. A grief that seemed frivolous in comparison to Jasnah's death, but one that threatened to tow Shallan down as much, or even more. "My sketchpads . . ." she whispered. "All gone." "Yes," Pattern said, sounding sorrowful. "Every drawing I've ever kept. My brothers, my father, Mother . . ." All sunk into the depths, along with her sketches of creatures and her musings on their connections, biology, and nature. Gone. Every bit of it gone. The world didn't depend upon Shallan's silly pictures of skyeels. She felt as if everything was broken anyway. "You will draw more," Pattern whispered. "I don't want to." Shallan blinked free more tears. "I will not stop vibrating. The wind will not stop blowing. You will not stop drawing." Shallan brushed her fingers across the picture of Jasnah. The woman's eyes were alight, almost alive againit was the first picture Shallan had drawn of Jasnah, done on the day they'd met. "The broken Soulcaster was with my things. It's now on the bottom of the ocean, lost. I won't be able to repair it and send it to my brothers." Pattern buzzed in what sounded like a morose tone to her. "Who are they?" Shallan asked. "The ones who did this, who killed her and took my art from me. Why would they do such horrible things?" "I do not know." "But you are certain that Jasnah was right?" Shallan said. "The Voidbringers are going to return?" "Yes. Spren . . . spren of him. They come." "These people," Shallan said, "they killed Jasnah. They were probably of the same group as Kabsal, and . . . and as my father. Why would they kill the person closest to understanding how, and why, the Voidbringers are coming back?" "I . . ." He faltered. "I shouldn't have asked," Shallan said. "I already know the answer, and it is a very human one. These people seek to control the knowledge so that they can profit from it. Profit from the apocalypse itself. We're going to see that doesn't happen." She lowered the sketch of Jasnah, setting it between the pages of a book to keep it safe. Mateform meek, for love to share, Given to life, it brings us joy. To find this form, one must care. True empathy one must employ. From the Listener Song of Listing, 5th stanza "It's been a while," Adolin said, kneeling and holding his Shardblade before him, point sunken a few inches into the stone ground. He was alone. Just him and the sword in one of the new preparation rooms, built alongside the dueling arena. "I remember when I won you," Adolin whispered, looking at his reflection in the blade. "Nobody took me seriously then, either. The fop with the nice clothing. Tinalar thought to duel me just to embarrass my father. Instead I got his Blade." If he'd lost, he would have had to give Tinalar his Plate, which he'd inherited from his mother's side of the family. Adolin had never named his Shardblade. Some did, some didn't. He'd never thought it appropriatenot because he didn't think the Blade deserved a name, but because he figured he didn't know the right one. This weapon had belonged to one of the Knights Radiant, long ago. That man had named the weapon, undoubtedly. To call it something else seemed presumptuous. Adolin had felt that way even before he'd started thinking of the Radiants in a good light, as his father did. This Blade would continue after Adolin died. He didn't own it. He was borrowing it for a time. Its surface was austerely smooth, long, sinuous like an eel, with ridges at the back like growing crystals. Shaped like a larger version of a standard longsword, it bore some resemblance to the enormous, twohanded broadswords he'd seen Horneaters wield. "A real duel," Adolin whispered to the Blade. "For real stakes. Finally. No more tiptoeing around it, no more limiting myself." The Shardblade didn't respond, but Adolin imagined that it listened to him. You couldn't use a weapon like this, a weapon that seemed like an extension of the soul itself, and not feel at times that it was alive. "I speak so confidently to everyone else," Adolin said, "since I know they rely on me. But if I lose today, that's it. No more duels, and a severe knot in Father's grand plan." He could hear people outside. Stomping feet, a buzz of chatter. Scraping on the stone. They'd come. Come to see Adolin win or be humiliated. "This might be our last fight together," Adolin said softly. "I appreciate what you've done for me. I know you'd do it for anyone who held you, but I still appreciate it. I . . . I want you to know: I believe in Father. I believe he's right, that the things he sees are real. That the world needs a united Alethkar. Fights like this one are my way to make it happen." Adolin and his father weren't politicians. They were soldiersDalinar by choice, Adolin more by circumstance. They wouldn't be able to just talk their way into a unified kingdom. They'd have to fight their way into one. Adolin stood up, patting his pocket, then dismissing his Blade to mist and crossing the small chamber. The stone walls of the narrow hallway he entered were etched with reliefs depicting the ten basic stances of swordsmanship. Those had been carved elsewhere, then placed here when this room was builta recent addition, to replace the tents that dueling preparation had once happened in. Windstance, Stonestance, Flamestance . . . There was a relief, with depicted stance, for each of the Ten Essences. Adolin counted them off to himself as he passed. This small tunnel had been cut into the stone of the arena itself, and ended in a small room cut into the rock. The bright sunlight of the dueling grounds glared around the edges of the final pair of doors between him and his opponent. With a proper preparation room for meditation, then this staging room to put on armor or retreat between bouts, the dueling arena at the warcamps was transforming into one as proper as those back in Alethkar. A welcome addition. Adolin stepped into the staging room, where his brother and aunt were waiting. Stormfather, his hands were sweating. He hadn't felt this nervous when riding into battle, when his life was actually in danger. Aunt Navani had just finished a glyphward. She stepped away from the pedestal, setting aside her brushpen, and held up the ward for him to see. It was painted in bright red on a white cloth. "Victory?" Adolin guessed. Navani lowered it, raising an eyebrow at him. "What?" Adolin said as his armorers entered, carrying the pieces of his Shardplate. "It says 'safety and glory,'" Navani said. "It wouldn't kill you to learn some glyphs, Adolin." He shrugged. "Never seemed that important." "Yes, well," Navani said, reverently folding the prayer and setting it in the brazier to burn. "Hopefully, you will eventually have a wife to do this for you. Both the reading of glyphs and the making of them." Adolin bowed his head, as was proper while the prayer burned. Pailiah knew, this wasn't the time to offend the Almighty. Once it was done, however, he glanced at Navani. "And what of the news of the ship?" They had expected word from Jasnah when she reached the Shallow Crypts, but none had been forthcoming. Navani had checked in with the harbormaster's office in that distant city. They said the Wind's Pleasure had not yet arrived. That put it a week overdue. Navani waved a dismissive hand. "Jasnah was on that ship." "I know, Aunt," Adolin said, shuffling uncomfortably. What had happened? Had the ship been caught in a highstorm? What of this woman Adolin might be marrying, if Jasnah had her way? "If the ship is delayed, it's because Jasnah is up to something," Navani said. "Watch. We'll get a communication from her in a few weeks, demanding some task or piece of information. I'll have to pry from her why she vanished. Battah send that girl some sense to go with her intelligence." Adolin didn't press the issue. Navani knew Jasnah better than anyone else. But . . . he was certainly concerned for Jasnah, and felt a sudden worry that he might not get to meet the girl, Shallan, when expected. Of course, the causal betrothal wasn't likely to work outbut a piece of him wished that it would. Letting someone else choose for him had a strange appeal, considering how loudly Danlan had cursed at him when he'd broken off that particular relationship. Danlan was still one of his father's scribes, so he saw her on occasion. More glares. But storm it, that one was not his fault. The things she'd said to her friends . . . An armorer set out his boots, and Adolin stepped into them, feeling them click into place. The armorers quickly affixed the greaves, then moved upward, covering him in toolight metal. Soon, all that remained were the gauntlets and the helm. He knelt down, placing his hands into the gauntlets at his side, fingers in their positions. In the strange manner of Shardplate, the armor constricted on its own, like a skyeel curling around its rat, pulling to comfortable tightness around his wrists. He turned and reached for his helm from the last armorer. It was Renarin. "You ate chicken?" Renarin asked as Adolin took the helm. "For breakfast." "And you talked to the sword?" "Had an entire conversation." "Mother's chain in your pocket?" "Checked three times." Navani folded her arms. "You still hold to those foolish superstitions?" Both brothers looked at her sharply. "They're not superstitions," Adolin said at the same time Renarin said, "It's just good luck, Aunt." She rolled her eyes. "I haven't done a formal duel in a long time," Adolin said, pulling on the helm, faceplate open. "I don't want anything to go wrong." "Foolishness," Navani repeated. "Trust in the Almighty and the Heralds, not whether or not you had the right meal before you duel. Storms. Next thing I know, you'll be believing in the Passions." Adolin shared a look with Renarin. His little traditions probably didn't help him win, but, well, why risk it? Every duelist had his own quirks. His hadn't let him down yet. "Our guards aren't happy about this," Renarin said softly. "They keep talking about how hard it's going to be to protect you when someone else is swinging a Shardblade at you." Adolin slammed down his faceplate. It misted at the sides, locking into place, becoming translucent and giving him a full view of the room. Adolin grinned, knowing full well Renarin couldn't see the expression. "I'm so sad to be denying them the chance to babysit me." "Why do you enjoy tormenting them?" "I don't like minders." "You've had guards before." "On the battlefield," Adolin said. It felt different to be followed about everywhere he went. "There's more. Don't lie to me, Brother. I know you too well." Adolin inspected his brother, whose eyes were so earnest behind his spectacles. The boy was too solemn all the time. "I don't like their captain," Adolin admitted. "Why? He saved Father's life." "He just bothers me." Adolin shrugged. "There's something about him that is off, Renarin. That makes me suspicious." "I think you don't like that he ordered you around, on the battlefield." "I barely even remember that," Adolin said lightly, stepping toward the door out. "Well, all right then. Off with you. And Brother?" "Yes?" "Try not to lose." Adolin pushed open the doors and stepped out onto the sand. He'd been in this arena before, using the argument that though the Alethi Codes of War proscribed duels between officers, he still needed to maintain his skills. To placate his father, Adolin had stayed away from important boutsbouts for championships or for Shards. He hadn't dared risk his Blade and Plate. Now everything was different. The air was still chill with winter, but the sun was bright overhead. His breath sounded against the plate of his helm, and his feet crunched in sand. He checked to see that his father was watching. He was. As was the king. Sadeas hadn't come. Just as well. That might have distracted Adolin with memories of one of the last times that Sadeas and Dalinar had been amiable, sitting together up on those stone steps, watching Adolin duel. Had Sadeas been planning a betrayal even then, while laughing with his father and chatting like an old friend? Focus. His foe today wasn't Sadeas, though someday . . . Someday soon he'd get that man in the arena. It was the goal of everything he was doing here. For now, he'd have to settle for Salinor, one of Thanadal's Shardbearers. The man had only the Blade, though he'd been able to borrow a set of the King's Plate for a bout with a full Shardbearer. Salinor stood on the other side of the arena, wearing the unornamented slategrey Plate and waiting for the highjudgeBrightlady Istowto signal the start of the bout. This fight was, in a way, an insult to Adolin. In order to get Salinor to agree to the duel, Adolin had been forced to bet both his Plate and his Blade against just Salinor's Blade. As if Adolin weren't worthy, and had to offer more potential spoils to justify bothering Salinor. As expected, the arena was overflowing with lighteyes. Even if it was speculated that Adolin had lost his former edge, bouts for Shards were very, very rare. This would be the first in over a year's time. "Summon Blades!" Istow ordered. Adolin thrust his hand to the side. The Blade fell into his waiting hand ten heartbeats latera moment before his opponent's appeared. Adolin's heart was beating more quickly than Salinor's. Perhaps that meant his opponent wasn't frightened, and underestimated him. Adolin fell into Windstance, elbows bent, turned to the side, sword's tip pointing up and backward. His opponent fell into Flamestance, sword held onehanded, other hand touching the blade, standing with a square posture of the feet. The stances were more a philosophy than a predefined set of moves. Windstance: flowing, sweeping, majestic. Flamestance: quick and flexible, better for shorter Shardblades. Windstance was familiar to Adolin. It had served him well throughout his career. But it didn't feel right today. We're at war, Adolin thought as Salinor edged forward, looking to test him. And every lighteyes in this army is a raw recruit. It wasn't time for a show. It was time for a beating. As Salinor drew close for a cautious strike to feel out his opponent, Adolin twisted and fell into Ironstance, with his sword held twohanded up beside his head. He slapped away Salinor's first strike, then stepped in and slammed his Blade down into the man's helm. Once, twice, three times. Salinor tried to parry, but he was obviously surprised by Adolin's attack, and two of the blows landed. Cracks crawled across Salinor's helm. Adolin heard grunts accompanying curses as Salinor tried to bring his weapon back to strike. This wasn't the way it was supposed to go. Where were the test blows, the art, the dance? Adolin growled, feeling the old Thrill of battle as he shoved aside Salinor's attackcareless of the hit it scored on his sidethen brought his Blade in twohanded and crashed it into his opponent's breastplate, like he was chopping wood. Salinor grunted again and Adolin raised his foot and kicked the man backward, throwing him to the ground. Salinor dropped his Bladea weakness of Flamestance's onehanded posture and it vanished to mist. Adolin stepped over the man and dismissed his own Blade, then kicked down with a booted heel into Salinor's helm. The piece of Plate exploded into molten bits, exposing a dazed, panicked face. Adolin slammed the heel of his foot against the breastplate next. Though Salinor tried to grab his foot, Adolin kicked relentlessly until the breastplate, too, shattered. "Stop! Stop!" Adolin halted, lowering his foot beside Salinor's head, looking up at the highjudge. The woman stood in her box, face red, voice furious. "Adolin Kholin!" she shouted. "This is a duel, not a wrestling match!" "Did I break any rules?" he shouted back. Silence. It struck him, through the rush in his ears, that the entire crowd had gone quiet. He could hear their breathing. "Did I break any rules?" Adolin demanded again. "This is not how a duel" "So I win," Adolin said. The woman sputtered. "This duel was to three broken pieces of Plate. You broke only two." Adolin looked down at the dazed Salinor. Then he reached down, ripped off the man's pauldron, and smashed it between two fists. "Done." Stunned silence. Adolin knelt beside his opponent. "Your Blade." Salinor tried to stand, but with the breastplate missing, doing so was more difficult. His armor wouldn't work properly, and he'd need to roll onto his side and work his way to his feet. Doable, but he obviously didn't have the experience with Plate to perform the maneuver. Adolin slammed him back down to the sand by his shoulder. "You've lost," Adolin growled. "You cheated!" Salinor sputtered. "How?" "I don't know how! It just It's not supposed to . . ." He trailed off as Adolin carefully placed a gauntleted hand against his neck. Salinor's eyes widened. "You wouldn't." Fearspren crawled out of the sand around him. "My prize," Adolin said, suddenly feeling drained. The Thrill faded from him. Storms, he'd never before felt like this in a duel. Salinor's Blade appeared in his hand. "Judgment," the highjudge said, sounding reluctant, "goes to Adolin Kholin, the victor. Salinor Eved forfeits his Shard." Salinor let the Blade slip from his fingers. Adolin took it and knelt beside Salinor, holding the weapon with pommel toward the man. "Break the bond." Salinor hesitated, then touched the ruby at the weapon's pommel. The gemstone flashed with light. The bond had been broken. Adolin stood, ripping the ruby free, then crushing it in a gauntleted hand. That wouldn't be needed, but it was a nice symbol. Sound finally rose in the crowd, frantic chattering. They'd come for a spectacle and had instead been given brutality. Well, that was how things often went in war. Good for them to see it, he supposed, though as he ducked back into the waiting room he was uncertain of himself. What he'd done was reckless. Dismissing his Blade? Putting himself in a position where the enemy could have gotten at his feet? Adolin entered the staging room, where Renarin looked at him wideeyed. "That," his younger brother said, "was incredible. It has to be the shortest Shard bout on record! You were amazing, Adolin!" "I . . . Thanks." He handed Salinor's Shardblade toward Renarin. "A present." "Adolin, are you sure? I mean, I'm not exactly the best with the Plate I already have." "Might as well have the full set," Adolin said. "Take it." Renarin seemed hesitant. "Take it," Adolin said again. Reluctantly, Renarin did so. He grimaced as he took it. Adolin shook his head, sitting down on one of the reinforced benches intended to hold a Shardbearer. Navani stepped into the room, having come down from the seats above. "What you did," she noted, "would not have worked on a more skillful opponent." "I know," Adolin said. "It was wise, then," Navani said. "You mask your true skill. People can assume this was won by trickery, pitfighting instead of proper dueling. They might continue to underestimate you. I can work with this to get you more duels." Adolin nodded, pretending that was why he'd done it. Workform worn for strength and care. Whispering spren breathe at your ear. Seek first this form, its mysteries to bear. Found here is freedom from fear. From the Listener Song of Listing, 19th stanza "Tradesman Tvlakv," Shallan said, "I believe that you are wearing a different pair of shoes today than you were on the first day of our trip." Tvlakv stopped on his way to the evening fire, but adapted smoothly to her challenge. He turned toward her with a smile, shaking his head. "I fear you must be mistaken, Brightness! Just after leaving on this trip, I lost one of my clothing trunks to a storm. I have but this one pair of shoes to my name." It was a flatout lie. However, after six days of traveling together, she had discovered that Tvlakv didn't much mind being caught in a lie. Shallan perched on her wagon's front seat in the dim light, feet bandaged, staring Tvlakv down. She'd spent most of the day milking knobweed stems for their sap, then rubbing it on her feet to keep away the rotspren. She felt extremely satisfied to have noticed the plantsit showed that though she lacked much practical knowledge, some of her studies could be useful in the wild. Did she confront him about his lie? What would it accomplish? He didn't seem to get embarrassed by such things. He watched her in the darkness, eyes beady, shadowed. "Well," Shallan said to him, "that is unfortunate. Perhaps in our travels we will meet another merchant group with whom I can trade for proper footwear." "I will be certain to look for such an opportunity, Brightness." Tvlakv gave her a bow and a fake smile, then continued toward the evening cook fire, which was burning fitfullythey were out of wood, and the parshmen had gone out into the evening to search for more. "Lies," Pattern said softly, his shape nearly invisible on the seat beside her. "He knows if I can't walk, I'm more dependent upon him." Tvlakv settled down beside the struggling fire. Nearby, the chullsunhooked from their wagonslumbered around, crunching tiny rockbuds beneath their gargantuan feet. They never strayed far. Tvlakv started whispering quietly with Tag, the mercenary. He kept a smile on his face, but she didn't trust those dark eyes of his, glittering in the firelight. "Go see what he's saying," Shallan told Pattern. "See . . . ?" "Listen to his words, then come back and repeat them to me. Don't get too close to the light." Pattern moved down the side of the wagon. Shallan leaned back against the hard seat, then took a small mirror she'd found in Jasnah's trunk out of her safepouch along with a single sapphire sphere for light. Just a mark, nothing too bright, and it was failing at that. When is that next highstorm due? Tomorrow? It was nearing the start of a new yearand that meant the Weeping was coming, though not for a number of weeks. It was a Light Year, wasn't it? Well, she could endure highstorms out here. She'd already been forced to suffer that indignity once, locked within her wagon. In the mirror, she could see that she looked awful. Red eyes with bags under them, her hair a frazzled mess, her dress frayed and soiled. She looked like a beggar who had found a oncenice dress in a trash heap. It didn't bother her overly much. Was she worried about looking pretty for slavers? Hardly. However, Jasnah hadn't cared what people thought of her, yet had always kept her appearance immaculate. Not that Jasnah had acted alluringly never for a moment. In fact, she'd disparaged such behavior in no uncertain terms. Using a fetching face to make men do as you wish is no different from a man using muscle to force a woman to his will, she'd said. Both are base, and both will fail a person as they age. No, Jasnah had not approved of seduction as a tool. However, people responded differently to those who looked in control of themselves. But what can I do? Shallan thought. I have no makeup; I don't even have shoes to wear. ". . . she could be someone important," Tvlakv's voice said abruptly nearby. Shallan jumped, then looked to the side, where Pattern now rested on the seat beside her. The voice came from there. "She is trouble," Tag's voice said. Pattern's vibrations produced a perfect imitation. "I still think we should just leave her and go." "It is fortunate for us," Tvlakv's voice said, "that the decision is not yours. You worry about making dinner. I shall worry about our little lighteyed companion. Someone is missing her, someone rich. If we can sell her back to them, Tag, it could be what finally digs us out." Pattern imitated the sounds of a crackling fire for a short time, then fell silent. The precise reproduction of the conversation was marvelous. This, Shallan thought, could be very useful. Unfortunately, something needed to be done about Tvlakv. She couldn't have him regarding her as something to be sold back to those missing herthat was discomfortingly close to viewing her as a slave. If she let him continue in such a mindset, she'd spend the entire trip worrying about him and his thugs. So what would Jasnah do, in this situation? Gritting her teeth, Shallan slipped down off the wagon, stepping gingerly on her wounded feet. She could walk, barely. She waited for the painspren to retreat, thencovering up her agonyshe approached the meager fire and sat down. "Tag, you are excused." He looked to Tvlakv, who nodded. Tag retreated to check on the parshmen. Bluth had gone to scout the area, as he often did at night, checking for signs of others passing this way. "It is time to discuss your payment," Shallan said. "Service to one so illustrious is payment in itself, of course." "Of course," she said, meeting his eyes. Don't back down. You can do this. "But a merchant must make a living. I am not blind, Tvlakv. Your men do not agree with your decision to help me. They think it a waste." Tvlakv glanced at Tag, looking unsettled. Hopefully, he wondered what else she had guessed. "Upon arriving at the Shattered Plains," Shallan said, "I will acquire a grand fortune. I do not have it yet." "That is . . . unfortunate." "Not in the slightest," Shallan said. "It is an opportunity, tradesman Tvlakv. The fortune I will acquire is the result of a betrothal. If I arrive safely, those who rescued mesaved me from pirates, sacrificed greatly to see me brought to my new familywill undoubtedly be well rewarded." "I am but a humble servant," Tvlakv said with a broad, false smile. "Rewards are the farthest thing from my mind." He thinks I'm lying about the fortune. Shallan ground her teeth in frustration, anger beginning to burn inside of her. This was just what Kabsal had done! Treating her like a plaything, a means to an end, not a real person. She leaned closer to Tvlakv into the firelight. "Do not toy with me, slaver." "I wouldn't dare" "You have no idea the storm you have wandered into," Shallan hissed, holding his eyes. "You have no idea what stakes have been wagered upon my arrival. Take your petty schemes and stuff them in a crevice. Do as I say, and I will see your debts canceled. You will be a free man again." "What? How . . . how did you" Shallan stood up, cutting him off. She felt somehow stronger than she had before. More determined. Her insecurities fluttered in the pit of her stomach, but she paid them no heed. Tvlakv didn't know she was timid. He didn't know she had been raised in rural isolation. To him, she was a woman of the court, accomplished at argument and accustomed to being obeyed. Standing before him, feeling radiant in the glow of the flamestowering above him and his grubby machinationsshe saw. Expectation wasn't just about what people expected of you. It was about what you expected of yourself. Tvlakv leaned away from her like a man before a raging bonfire. He shrank back, eyes wide, raising an arm. Shallan realized that she was glowing faintly with the light of spheres. Her dress no longer bore the tears and smudges it had before. It was majestic. Instinctively, she let the glow from her skin fade, hoping Tvlakv would think it a trick of the firelight. She spun and left him shaking beside the fire as she walked back to the wagon. Darkness was fully upon them, the first moon having yet to rise. As she walked, her feet didn't hurt nearly as much as they had. Was the knobweed sap doing that much good? She reached the wagon and began climbing back into the seat, but Bluth chose that moment to crash into camp. "Put out the fire!" he cried. Tvlakv looked at him dumbfounded. Bluth dashed ahead, passing Shallan and reaching the fire, where he grabbed the pot of steaming broth. He turned it over onto the flames, splashing out ashes and steam with a hiss, scattering flamespren, which faded away. Tvlakv jumped up, looking down as filthy brothfaintly lit by the dying embersran past his feet. Shallan, gritting her teeth against the pain, got off the wagon and approached. Tag ran up from the other direction. ". . . seem to be several dozen of them," Bluth was saying in a low voice. "They are well armed, but have no horses or chulls, so they are not rich." "What is this?" Shallan demanded. "Bandits," Bluth said. "Or mercenaries. Or whatever you want to call them." "Nobody polices this area, Brightness," Tvlakv said. He glanced at her, then looked away quickly, obviously still shaken. "It is truly a wilderness, you see. The presence of the Alethi on the Shattered Plains means many like to come and go. Trading caravans like ours, craftsmen seeking work, lowborn lighteyed sellswords with an eye toward enlisting. Those two conditionsno laws, but plenty of travelersattract a certain kind of ruffian." "Dangerous," Tag agreed. "These types take what they want. Leave only corpses." "Did they see our fire?" Tvlakv asked, wringing his cap in his hands. "Don't know," Bluth said, glancing over his shoulder. Shallan could barely make out his expression in the darkness. "Didn't want to get close. I snuck up to get a count, then ran back here fast." "How can you be sure they're bandits?" Shallan asked. "They might just be soldiers on their way to the Shattered Plains, as Tvlakv said." "They fly no banners, display no sigils," Bluth said. "But they have good equipment and keep a tight guard. They're deserters. I'd bet the chulls on it." "Bah," Tvlakv said. "You'd bet my chulls on a hand with the tower, Bluth. But Brightness, for all his terrible gambling sense, I believe the fool is right. We must harness the chulls and depart immediately. The night's darkness is our ally, and we must make the most of it." She nodded. The men moved quickly, even the portly Tvlakv, breaking down camp and hooking up the chulls. The slaves grumbled at not getting their food for the night. Shallan stopped beside their cage, feeling ashamed. Her family had owned slavesand not just parshmen and ardents. Ordinary slaves. In most cases, they were nothing worse than darkeyes without the right of travel. These poor souls, however, were sickly and halfstarved. You're only one step from being in one of those pens yourself, Shallan, she thought with a shiver as Tvlakv passed, hissing curses at the captives. No. He wouldn't dare put you in there. He'd just kill you. Bluth had to be reminded again to give her a hand up into the wagon. Tag ushered the parshmen into their wagon, cursing at them for moving so slowly, then climbed into his seat and took up the tail position. The first moon began to rise, making it lighter than Shallan would have liked. It seemed to her that each crunching footstep of the chulls was as loud as a highstorm's thunder. They brushed the plants she'd named crustspines, with their branches like tubes of sandstone. Those cracked and shook. Progress was not quickchulls never were. As they moved, she picked out lights on a hillside, frighteningly close. Campfires not a tenminute walk away. A shifting of winds brought the sound of distant voices, of metal on metal, perhaps men sparring. Tvlakv turned the wagons eastward. Shallan frowned in the night. "Why this way?" she whispered. "Remember that gully we saw?" Bluth whispered. "Putting it between us and them, in case they hear and come looking." Shallan nodded. "What can we do if they catch us?" "It won't be good." "Couldn't we bribe our way past them?" "Deserters ain't like common bandits," Bluth said. "These men, they've given up everything. Oaths. Families. When you desert, it breaks you. It leaves you willing to do anything, because you've already given away everything you could have cared about losing." "Wow," Shallan said, looking over her shoulder. "I . . . Yeah, you spend your whole life with a decision like that, you do. You wish any honor were left for you, but know you've already given it away." He fell silent, and Shallan was too nervous to prod him further. She continued watching those lights on the hillside as the wagonsblessedlyrolled farther and farther into the night, eventually escaping into the darkness. Nimbleform has a delicate touch. Gave the gods this form to many, Tho' once defied, by the gods they were crushed. This form craves precision and plenty. From the Listener Song of Listing, 27th stanza "You know," Moash said from Kaladin's side, "I always thought this place would be . . ." "Bigger?" Drehy offered in his lightly accented voice. "Better," Moash said, looking around the practice grounds. "It looks just like where darkeyed soldiers practice." These sparring grounds were reserved for Dalinar's lighteyes. In the center, the large open courtyard was filled with a thick layer of sand. A raised wooden walkway ran around the perimeter, stretching between the sand and the narrow surrounding building, which was just one room deep. That narrow building wrapped around the courtyard except at the front, which had a wall with an archway for the entrance, and had a wide roof that extended, giving shade to the wooden walkway. Lighteyed officers stood chatting in the shade or watching men sparring in the sunlight of the yard, and ardents moved this way and that, delivering weapons or drinks. It was a common layout for training grounds. Kaladin had been in several buildings like this. Mostly back when he'd first been training in Amaram's army. Kaladin set his jaw, resting his fingers on the archway leading into the training grounds. It had been seven days since Amaram's arrival in the warcamps. Seven days of dealing with the fact that Amaram and Dalinar were friends. He'd decided to be storming happy about Amaram's arrival. After all, it meant that Kaladin would be able to find a chance to finally stick a spear in that man. No, he thought, entering the training grounds, not a spear. A knife. I want to be up close to him, facetoface, so I can watch him panic as he dies. I want to feel that knife going in. Kaladin waved to his men and entered through the archway, forcing himself to focus on his surroundings instead of Amaram. That archway was good stone, quarried nearby, built into a structure with the traditional eastward reinforcement. Judging by the modest crem deposits, these walls hadn't been here long. It was another sign that Dalinar was starting to think of the warcamps as permanenthe was taking down simple, temporary buildings and replacing them with sturdy structures. "I don't know what you expected," Drehy said to Moash as he inspected the grounds. "How would you make sparring grounds different for the lighteyes? Use diamond dust instead of sand?" "Ouch," Kaladin said. "I don't know how," Moash said. "It's just that they make such a big deal of it. No darkeyes on the 'special' sparring grounds. I don't see what makes them special." "That's because you don't think like lighteyes," Kaladin said. "This place is special for one simple reason." "Why's that?" Moash asked. "Because we're not here," Kaladin said, leading the way in. "Not normally, at least." He had with him Drehy and Moash, along with five other men, a mix of Bridge Four members and a few survivors of the old Cobalt Guard. Dalinar had assigned those to Kaladin, and to Kaladin's surprise and pleasure, they had accepted him as their leader without a word of complaint. To a man, he'd been impressed with them. The old Guard had deserved its reputation. A few, all darkeyed, had started eating with Bridge Four. They'd asked for Bridge Four patches, and Kaladin had gotten them somebut ordered them to put their Cobalt Guard patches on the other shoulder, and continue to wear them as a mark of pride. Spear in hand, Kaladin led his team toward a group of ardents who bustled in their direction. The ardents wore Vorin religious garbloose trousers and tunics, tied at the waist with simple ropes. Pauper's clothing. They were slaves, and then they also weren't. Kaladin had never given much thought to them. His mother would probably lament how little Kaladin cared for religious observance. The way Kaladin figured it, the Almighty didn't show much concern for him, so why care back? "This is the lighteyes' training ground," said the lead ardent sternly. She was a willowy woman, though you weren't supposed to think of ardents as male or female. She had her head shaven, like all ardents. Her male companions wore square beards with clean upper lips. "Captain Kaladin, Bridge Four," Kaladin said, scanning the practice grounds and shouldering his spear. It would be very easy for an accident to happen here, during sparring. He'd have to watch for that. "Here to guard the Kholin boys while they practice today." "Captain?" one of the ardents scoffed. "You" Another ardent silenced him by whispering something. News about Kaladin had traveled quickly through camp, but ardents could be an isolated lot, sometimes. "Drehy," Kaladin said, pointing. "See those rockbuds growing up on the top of the wall there?" "Yup." "They're cultivated. That means there's a way up." "Of course there is," the lead ardent said. "The stairwell is at the northwestern corner. I have the key." "Good, you can let him in," Kaladin said. "Drehy, keep an eye on things from up there." "On it," Drehy said, trotting in the direction of the stairwell. "And what kinds of danger do you expect them to be in here?" the ardent said, folding her arms. "I see lots of weapons," Kaladin said, "lots of people moving in and out, and . . . are those Shardblades I see? I wonder what could possibly go wrong." He gave her a pointed look. The woman sighed, then handed her key to an assistant, who jogged off after Drehy. Kaladin pointed to positions for his other men to watch from. They moved off, leaving only him and Moash. The lean man had turned immediately at the mention of Shardblades, and now watched them hungrily. A pair of lighteyed men bearing them had moved out into the center of the sands. One Blade was long and thin, with a large crossguard, while the other was wide and enormous, with wicked spikesslightly flamelikejutting out of both sides along the lower third. Both weapons had protective strips on the edges, like a partial sheath. "Huh," Moash said, "I don't recognize either of those men. I thought I knew all the Shardbearers in camp." "They aren't Shardbearers," the ardent said. "They're using the King's Blades." "Elhokar lets people use his Shardblade?" Kaladin asked. "It is a grand tradition," the ardent said, seeming annoyed that she had to explain. "The highprinces used to do it in their own princedoms, before the reunification, and now it is the king's obligation and honor. Men may use the King's Blade and Plate to practice. The lighteyes of our armies must be trained with Shards, for the good of all. Blade and Plate are difficult to master, and if a Shardbearer falls in battle, it is important that others be capable of their immediate use." That made sense, Kaladin supposed, though he found it hard to imagine any lighteyes letting someone else touch his Blade. "The king has two Shardblades?" "One is that of his father, kept for the tradition of training Shardbearers." The ardent glanced at the sparring men. "Alethkar has always had the finest Shardbearers in the world. This tradition is part of it. The king has hinted that someday, he might bestow his father's Blade upon a worthy warrior." Kaladin nodded in appreciation. "Not bad," he said. "I'll bet that a lot of men come to practice with them, each hoping to prove he's the most skilled and most deserving. A good way for Elhokar to trick a bunch of men into training." The ardent huffed and walked away. Kaladin watched the Shardblades flash in the air. The men using them barely knew what they were doing. The real Shardbearers he'd seen, the real Shardbearers he'd fought, hadn't lurched about swinging the oversized swords like polearms. Even Adolin's duel the other day had "Storms, Kaladin," Moash said, watching the ardent stalk away. "And you were telling me to be respectful?" "Hmm?" "You didn't use an honorific for the king," Moash said. "Then you implied that the lighteyes coming to practice were lazy and needed to be tricked into it. I thought we were supposed to avoid antagonizing the lighteyes?" Kaladin looked away from the Shardbearers. Distracted, he'd spoken thoughtlessly. "You're right," he said. "Thanks for the reminder." Moash nodded. "I want you by the gate," Kaladin said, pointing. A group of parshmen came in, bearing boxes, probably foodstuffs. Those wouldn't be dangerous. Would they? "Pay particularly close attention to servants, sword runners, or anyone else seemingly innocuous who approaches Highprince Dalinar's sons. A knife to the side from someone like that would be one of the best ways to pull off an assassination." "Fine. But tell me something, Kal. Who is this Amaram fellow?" Kaladin turned sharply toward Moash. "I see how you look at him," Moash said. "I see how your face gets when the other bridgemen mention him. What did he do to you?" "I was in his army," Kaladin said. "The last place I fought, before . . ." Moash gestured to Kaladin's forehead. "That's his work, then?" "Yeah." "So he's not the hero people say he is," Moash said. He seemed pleased by that fact. "His soul is as dark as any I've ever known." Moash took Kaladin by the arm. "We are going to get back at them somehow. Sadeas, Amaram. The ones who have done these things to us?" Angerspren boiled up around him, like pools of blood in the sand. Kaladin met Moash's eyes, then nodded. "Good enough for me," Moash said, shouldering his spear and jogging off toward the position Kaladin had indicated, the spren vanishing. "He's another who needs to learn to smile more," Syl whispered. Kaladin hadn't noticed her flitting nearby, and now she settled down on his shoulder. Kaladin turned to walk around the perimeter of the practice grounds, noting each entrance. Perhaps he was being overly cautious. He just liked doing jobs well, and it had been a lifetime since he'd had a job other than saving Bridge Four. Sometimes, though, it seemed like his job was impossible to do well. During the highstorm last week, someone had again sneaked into Dalinar's rooms, scrawling a second number on the wall. Counting it down, it pointed at the same date a little over a month away. The highprince didn't seem worried, and wanted the event kept quiet. Storms . . . was he writing the glyphs himself while he had fits? Or was it some kind of spren? Kaladin was sure nobody could have gotten past him this time to get in. "Do you want to talk about the thing that is bothering you?" Syl asked from her perch. "I'm worried about what's happening during the highstorms with Dalinar," Kaladin said. "Those numbers . . . something is wrong. You still seeing those spren about?" "Red lightning?" she asked. "I think so. They're hard to spot. You haven't seen them?" Kaladin shook his head, hefting his spear and walking over onto the walkway around the sands. Here, he peeked into a storage room. Wooden practice swords, some the size of Shardblades, and sparring leathers lined the wall. "Is that all that's bothering you?" Syl asked. "What else would be?" "Amaram and Dalinar." "It's not a big deal. Dalinar Kholin is friends with one of the worst murderers I've ever met. So? Dalinar is lighteyed. He's probably friends with a lot of murderers." "Kaladin . . ." Syl said. "Amaram's worse than Sadeas, you know," Kaladin said, walking around the storage room, checking for doorways. "Everyone knows that Sadeas is a rat. He's straight with you. 'You're a bridgeman,' he told me, 'and I'm going to use you up until you die.' Amaram, though . . . He promised to be more, a brightlord like those in the stories. He told me he'd protect Tien. He feigned honor. That's worse than any depth Sadeas could ever reach." "Dalinar's not like Amaram," Syl said. "You know he's not." "People say the same things about him that they did of Amaram. That they still do of Amaram." Kaladin stepped back out into the sunlight and continued his circuit of the grounds, passing dueling lighteyes who kicked up sand as they grunted, sweated, and clacked wooden swords against one another. Each pair was attended by a halfdozen darkeyed servants carrying towels and canteensand many had a parshman or two bring them chairs to sit on when they rested. Stormfather. Even in something routine like this, the lighteyes had to be pampered. Syl zipped out into the air in front of Kaladin, coming down like a storm. Literally like a storm. She stopped in the air right in front of him, a cloud boiling from beneath her feet, flashing with lightning. "You can honestly say," she demanded, "that you think Dalinar Kholin is only pretending to be honorable?" "I" "Don't you lie to me, Kaladin," she said, stepping forward, pointing. Diminutive though she was, in that moment, she seemed as vast as a highstorm. "No lies. Ever." He took a deep breath. "No," he finally said. "No, Dalinar gave up his Blade for us. He's a good man. I accept that. Amaram has him fooled. He had me fooled too, so I suppose I can't blame Kholin too much." Syl nodded curtly, the cloud dissipating. "You should talk to him about Amaram," she said, walking in the air beside Kaladin's head as he continued scouting the structure. Her steps were small, and she should have fallen behind, but she didn't. "And what should I say?" Kaladin asked. "Should I go to him and accuse a lighteyes of the third dahn of murdering his own troops? Of stealing my Shardblade? I'll sound like either a fool or a madman." "But" "He won't listen, Syl," Kaladin said. "Dalinar Kholin might be a good man, but he won't let me speak ill of a powerful lighteyes. It's the way of the world. And that is truth." He continued his inspection, wanting to know what was in the rooms where people could watch people spar. Some were for storage, others for bathing and resting. Several of those were locked, with lighteyes inside recovering from their daily sparring. Lighteyes liked baths. The back side of the structure, opposite the entrance gate, held the living quarters for the ardents. Kaladin had never seen so many shaved heads and robed bodies scurrying about. Back in Hearthstone, the citylord had kept only a few wizened old ardents for tutoring his son. Those had also come down to the town periodically to burn prayers and elevate darkeyes' Callings. These ardents didn't seem to be the same type. They had the physiques of warriors, and would often step in to practice with lighteyes who needed a sparring partner. Some of the ardents had dark eyes, but still used the sword they weren't considered lighteyed or darkeyed. They were just ardents. And what do I do if one of them decides to try killing the princelings? Storms, but he hated some aspects of bodyguard duty. If nothing happened, then you were never sure if it was because nothing was wrong, or because you had deterred potential assassins. Adolin and his brother finally arrived, both fully armored in their Shardplate, helms under their arms. They were accompanied by Skar and a handful of former members of the Cobalt Guard. Those saluted Kaladin as he walked up and gestured that they were dismissed, the shift officially changed. Skar would be off to join Teft and the group protecting Dalinar and Navani. "The area is as secure as I can make it without disrupting training, Brightlord," Kaladin said, walking up to Adolin. "My men and I will keep an eye out while you spar, but don't hesitate to give a holler if something seems amiss." Adolin grunted, surveying the place, barely paying Kaladin any heed. He was a tall man, his few black Alethi hairs overwhelmed by quite a bit of golden blond. His father didn't have that. Adolin's mother had been from Rira, perhaps? Kaladin turned to walk toward the northern side of the courtyard, where he'd have a different view from Moash. "Bridgeman," Adolin called. "You've decided to start using proper titles for people? Didn't you call my father 'sir'?" "He's in my chain of command," Kaladin said, turning back. The simple answer seemed the best. "And I'm not?" Adolin asked, frowning. "No." "And if I give you an order?" "I'll comply with any reasonable requests, Brightlord. But if you wish for someone to fetch you tea between bouts, you'll have to send someone else. There should be plenty here willing to lick your heels." Adolin stepped up to him. Though the deep blue Shardplate added only a few inches to his height, he seemed to tower because of it. Perhaps that line about licking heels had been brash. Adolin represented something, though. The privilege of the lighteyes. He wasn't like Amaram or Sadeas, who brought out Kaladin's hatred. Men like Adolin just annoyed him, reminding him that in this world, some sipped wine and wore fancy clothing while others were made slaves almost on a whim. "I owe you my life," Adolin growled, as if it hurt to say the words. "That's the only reason I haven't yet thrown you through a window." He reached up with a gauntleted finger and tapped at Kaladin's chest. "But my patience with you won't extend as far as my father's, little bridgeman. There's something off about you, something I can't put my finger on. I'm watching you. Remember your place." Great. "I'll keep you alive, Brightlord," Kaladin said, pushing aside the finger. "That's my place." "I can keep myself alive," Adolin said, turning away and tromping across the sand with a clink of Plate. "Your job is to watch over my brother." Kaladin was more than happy to let him leave. "Spoiled child," he muttered. Kaladin supposed that Adolin was a few years older than him. Just recently, Kaladin had realized that he'd passed his twentieth birthday while a bridgeman, and never known it. Adolin was in his early twenties. But being a child had little to do with age. Renarin still stood awkwardly near the front gate, wearing Dalinar's former Shardplate, carrying his newly won Shardblade. Adolin's quick duel from yesterday was the talk of the warcamps, and it would take Renarin five days to fully bond his Blade before he could dismiss it. The young man's Shardplate was the color of dark steel, unpainted. That was how Dalinar had preferred it. By giving his Plate away, Dalinar suggested that he felt he needed to win his next victories as a politician. It was a laudable move; you couldn't always have men following you because they feared you could beat them upor even because you were the best soldier among them. You needed more, far more, to be a true leader. Yet Kaladin did wish Dalinar had kept the Plate. Anything that helped the man stay alive would have been a boon for Bridge Four. Kaladin leaned back against a column, folding his arms, spear in the crook of his arm, watching the area for trouble and inspecting everyone that got too close to the princelings. Adolin walked over and grabbed his brother by the shoulder, towing him across the courtyard. Various people sparring in the square stopped and bowedif not in uniformor saluted the princelings as they passed. A group of greyclothed ardents had gathered at the back of the courtyard, and the woman from earlier stepped forward to chat with the brothers. Adolin and Renarin both bowed formally to her. It had been three weeks now since Renarin had been given his Plate. Why had Adolin waited so long to bring him here for training? Had he been waiting until the duel, so he could win the lad a Blade too? Syl landed on Kaladin's shoulder. "Adolin and Renarin are both bowing to her." "Yeah," Kaladin said. "But isn't the ardent a slave? One their father owns?" Kaladin nodded. "Humans don't make sense." "If you're only now learning that," Kaladin said, "then you haven't been paying attention." Syl tossed her hair, which moved realistically. The gesture itself was very human. Perhaps she'd been paying attention after all. "I don't like them," she said airily. "Either one. Adolin or Renarin." "You don't like anyone who carries Shards." "Exactly." "You called the Blades abominations before," Kaladin said. "But the Radiants carried them. So were the Radiants wrong to do so?" "Of course not," she said, sounding like he was saying something completely stupid. "The Shards weren't abominations back then." "What changed?" "The knights," Syl said, growing quiet. "The knights changed." "So it's not that the weapons are abominations specifically," Kaladin said. "It's that the wrong people are carrying them." "There are no right people anymore," Syl whispered. "Maybe there never were. . . ." "And where did they come from in the first place?" Kaladin asked. "Shardblades. Shardplate. Even modern fabrials are nowhere near as good. So where did the ancients get weapons so amazing?" Syl fell silent. She had a frustrating habit of doing that when his questions got too specific. "Well?" he prompted. "I wish I could tell you." "Then do." "I wish it worked that way. It doesn't." Kaladin sighed, turning his attention back to Adolin and Renarin, where it was supposed to be. The senior ardent had led them to the very back of the courtyard, where another group of people sat on the ground. They were ardents too, but something was different about them. Teachers of some sort? As Adolin spoke to them, Kaladin did another quick scan around the courtyard, then frowned. "Kaladin?" Syl asked. "Man in the shadows over there," Kaladin said, gesturing with his spear toward a place under the eaves. A man stood there, leaning crossarmed against a waisthigh wooden railing. "He's watching the princelings." "Um, so is everyone else." "He's different," Kaladin said. "Come on." Kaladin wandered over casually, unthreatening. The man was probably just a servant. Longhaired, with a short but scruffy black beard, he wore loose tan clothing tied with ropes. He looked out of place in the sparring yard, and that itself was probably enough to indicate he wasn't an assassin. The best assassins never stood out. Still, the man had a robust build and a scar on his cheek. So he'd seen fighting. Best to check on him. The man watched Renarin and Adolin intently and, from this angle, Kaladin couldn't see if his eyes were light or dark. As Kaladin got close, his foot audibly scraped the sand. The man spun immediately, and Kaladin leveled his spear by instinct. He could see the man's eyes nowthey were brownbut Kaladin had trouble placing his age. Those eyes seemed old somehow, but the man's skin didn't seem wrinkled enough to match them. He could have been thirtyfive. Or he could have been seventy. Too young, Kaladin thought, though he couldn't say why. Kaladin lowered his spear. "Sorry, I'm a little jumpy. First few weeks on the job." He tried to say it disarmingly. It didn't work. The man looked him up and down, still showing the chained menace of a warrior deciding whether or not to strike. Finally, he turned away from Kaladin and relaxed, watching Adolin and Renarin. "Who are you?" Kaladin asked, stepping up beside the man. "I'm new, as I said. I'm trying to learn everyone's names." "You're the bridgeman. The one who saved the highprince." "I am," Kaladin said. "You don't need to keep prying," the man said. "I'm not going to hurt your Damnation prince." He had a low, grinding voice. Scratchy. Strange accent too. "He's not my prince," Kaladin said. "Just my responsibility." He looked the man over again, noticing something. The light clothing, tied with ropes, was very similar to what some of the ardents were wearing. The full head of hair had thrown Kaladin off. "You're a soldier," Kaladin guessed. "Exsoldier, I mean." "Yeah," the man said. "They call me Zahel." Kaladin nodded, the irregularities clicking into place. Occasionally, a soldier retired to the ardentia, if he had no other life to return to. Kaladin would have expected them to require the man to at least shave his head. I wonder if Hav is in one of these monasteries somewhere, Kaladin thought idly. What would he think of me now? He'd probably be proud. He always had seen guard duty as the most respectable of a soldier's assignments. "What are they doing?" Kaladin asked Zahel, nodding toward Renarin and Adolinwho, despite the encumbrance of their Shardplate, had seated themselves on the ground before the elder ardents. Zahel grunted. "The younger Kholin has to be chosen by a master. For training." "Can't they just pick whichever one they want?" "Doesn't work that way. It's kind of an awkward situation, though. Prince Renarin, he's never practiced much with a sword." Zahel paused. "Being chosen by a master is a step that most lighteyed boys of suitable rank take by the time they're ten." Kaladin frowned. "Why didn't he ever train?" "Health problems of some sort." "And they'd really turn him down?" Kaladin asked. "The highprince's own son?" "They could, but they probably won't. Not brave enough." The man narrowed his eyes as Adolin stood up and gestured. "Damnation. I knew it was suspicious that he waited for this until I got back." "Swordmaster Zahel!" Adolin called. "You aren't sitting with the others!" Zahel sighed, then gave Kaladin a resigned glance. "I'm probably not brave enough either. I'll try not to hurt him too much." He walked around the railing and jogged over. Adolin clasped Zahel's hand eagerly, then pointed to Renarin. Zahel looked distinctly out of place among the other ardents with their bald heads, neatly trimmed beards, and cleaner clothing. "Huh," Kaladin said. "Did he seem odd to you?" "You all seem odd to me," Syl said lightly. "Everyone but Rock, who is a complete gentleman." "He thinks you're a god. You shouldn't encourage him." "Why not? I am a god." He turned his head, looking at her flatly as she sat on his shoulder. "Syl . . ." "What? I am!" She grinned and held up her fingers, as if pinching something very small. "A little piece of one. Very, very little. You have permission to bow to me now." "Kind of hard to do when you're sitting on my shoulder," he mumbled. He noticed Lopen and Shen arriving at the gate, likely bearing the daily reports from Teft. "Come on. Let's see if Teft has anything he needs from me, then we'll do a circuit and check on Drehy and Moash." Dullform dread, with the mind most lost. The lowest, and one not bright. To find this form, one need banish the cost. It finds you and brings you to blight. From the Listener Song of Listing, final stanza Riding on her wagon, Shallan covered her anxiety with scholarship. There was no way to tell if the deserters had spotted the trails of crushed rockbuds made by the caravan. They might be following. They might not be. No use dwelling on it, she told herself. And so she found a distraction. "The leaves can start their own shoots," she said, holding up one of the small, round leaves on the tip of her finger. She turned it toward the sunlight. Bluth sat beside her, hulking like a boulder. Today, he wore a hat that was entirely too stylish for himdusty white, with a brim that folded upward at the sides. He would occasionally flick his guiding reedit was at least as long as Shallan was tallon the shell of the chull ahead. Shallan had made a small list of the beats he used in the back of her book. Bluth hit twice, paused, and hit again. That made the animal slow as the wagon in front of themdriven by Tvlakvbegan moving up a hillside covered in tiny rockbuds. "You see?" Shallan said, showing him the leaf. "That's why the plant's limbs are so fragile. When the storm comes, it will shatter these branches and break off the leaves. They will blow away and start new shoots, building their own shell. They grow so quickly. Faster than I'd have expected out here, in these infertile lands." Bluth grunted. Shallan sighed, lowering her finger and putting the tiny plant back in the cup she'd been using to nurture it. She glanced over her shoulder. No sign of pursuit. She really should just stop worrying. She turned back to her new sketchbookone of Jasnah's notebooks that didn't have many pages filledthen began a quick sketch of the small leaf. She didn't have very good materials, only a single charcoal pencil, some pens, and a little ink, but Pattern had been right. She could not stop. She had begun with a replacement sketch of the santhid as she remembered it from her dip in the sea. The picture wasn't equal to the one she'd crafted right after the event, but having it againin any formhad started healing the wounds inside. She finished the leaf, then turned the page and began a sketch of Bluth. She didn't particularly want to restart her collection of people with him, but her options were limited. Unfortunately, that hat really did look sillyit was far too small for his head. The image of him huddled forward like a crab, back to the sky and hat on his head . . . well, at least it would be an interesting composition. "Where did you get the hat?" she asked as she sketched. "Traded for it," Bluth mumbled, not looking at her. "Did it cost much?" He shrugged. Shallan had lost her own hats in the sinking, but had persuaded Tvlakv to give her one of the ones woven by the parshmen. It wasn't particularly attractive, but it kept the sun off her face. Despite the bumping wagon, Shallan eventually managed to finish her sketch of Bluth. She inspected it, dissatisfied. It was a poor way to start her collection, particularly as she felt she'd caricatured him somewhat. She pursed her lips. What would Bluth look like if he weren't always scowling at her? If his clothing were neater, if he carried a proper weapon instead of that old cudgel? She flipped the page and started again. A different compositionidealized, perhaps, but somehow also right. He could actually look dashing, once you dressed him up properly. A uniform. A spear, planted to his side. Eyes toward the horizon. By the time she'd finished, she was feeling much better about the day. She smiled at the product, then held it up to Bluth as Tvlakv called the midday halt. Bluth glanced at the picture, but said nothing. He gave the chull a few whacks to stop it alongside the one pulling Tvlakv's wagon. Tag rolled up his wagon he carried the slaves, this time. "Knobweed!" Shallan said, lowering her sketch and pointing at a patch of thin reeds growing behind a nearby rock. Bluth groaned. "More of that plant?" "Yes. Would you kindly fetch them for me?" "Can't the parshmen do it? I'm supposed to feed the chulls. . . ." "Which would you rather make wait, guardsman Bluth? The chulls, or the lighteyed woman?" Bluth scratched his head underneath the hat, then sullenly climbed down from the wagon and walked toward the reeds. Nearby, Tvlakv stood on his wagon, watching the horizon to the south. A thin trail of smoke rose in that direction. Shallan felt an immediate chill. She scrambled from the wagon and hurried to Tvlakv. "Storms!" Shallan said. "Is it the deserters? They are following us?" "Yes. They have stopped to cook for midday, it seems," Tvlakv said from his perch atop his wagon. "They do not care about us seeing their fire." He forced out a laugh. "That is a good sign. They probably know we are only three wagons, and are barely worth chasing. So long as we keep moving and don't stop often, they will give up the chase. Yes. I'm certain." He hopped down from his wagon, then hurriedly began to water the slaves. He didn't bother to make the parshmen do ithe did the work himself. That, more than anything, testified to his nervousness. He wanted to be moving again quickly. That left the parshmen to continue weaving in their cage behind Tvlakv's wagon. Anxious, Shallan stood there watching. The deserters had spotted the wagons' trail of broken rockbuds. She found herself sweating, but what could she do? She couldn't hurry the caravan. She had to simply hope, as Tvlakv said, that they could stay ahead of pursuit. That didn't seem likely. The chull wagons couldn't be faster than marching men. Distract yourself, Shallan thought as she started to panic. Find something to take your mind off the pursuit. What about Tvlakv's parshmen? Shallan eyed them. Perhaps a drawing of the two of them in their cage? No. She was too nervous for drawing, but perhaps she could find something out. She walked to the parshmen. Her feet complained, but the pain was manageable. In fact, in contrast to how she'd covered it up on previous days, now she exaggerated her winces. Better to make Tvlakv think she was less well than she was. She stopped at the cage's bars. The back was unlockedparshmen never ran. Buying these two must have been quite an investment for Tvlakv. Parshmen weren't cheap, and many monarchs and powerful lighteyes hoarded them. One of the two glanced at Shallan, then turned back to his work. Her work? It was difficult to tell the males from the females without undressing them. Both of these two had red on white marbled skin. They had squat bodies, perhaps five feet tall, and were bald. It was so difficult to see these two humble workers as a threat. "What are your names?" Shallan asked. One looked up. The other kept working. "Your name," Shallan prodded. "One," the parshman said. He pointed at his companion. "Two." He put his head down and kept working. "Are you happy with your life?" Shallan asked. "Would you rather be free, given the chance?" The parshman looked up at her and frowned. He scrunched up his brow, mouthing a few of the words, then shook his head. He didn't understand. "Freedom?" Shallan prodded. He hunched down to work. He actually looks uncomfortable, Shallan thought. Embarrassed for not understanding. His posture seemed to say, "Please stop asking me questions." Shallan tucked her sketchbook under her arm and took a Memory of the two of them working there. These are evil monsters, she told herself forcefully, creatures of legend who will soon be bent on destroying everyone and everything around them. Standing here, looking in at them, she found it difficult to believe, even though she had accepted the evidence. Storms. Jasnah was right. Persuading the lighteyes to rid themselves of their parshmen was going to be nearly impossible. She would need very, very solid proof. Troubled, she walked back to her seat and climbed up, making sure to wince. Bluth had left her a bundle of knobweed, and was now caring for the chulls. Tvlakv was digging out some food for a quick lunch, which they'd probably eat while moving. She quieted her nerves and forced herself to do some sketches of nearby plants. She soon moved on to a sketch of the horizon and the rock formations nearby. The air didn't feel as cold as it had during her first days with the slavers, though her breath still steamed before her in the mornings. As Tvlakv passed by, he gave her an uncomfortable glance. He had treated her differently since their confrontation at the fire last night. Shallan continued sketching. It was certainly a lot flatter out here than back home. And there were far fewer plants, though they were more robust. And . . . . . . And was that another column of smoke up ahead? She stood up and raised a hand to shade her eyes. Yes. More smoke. She looked southward, toward the pursuing mercenaries. Nearby, Tag stopped, noticing what she had. He hustled over to Tvlakv, and the two started arguing softly. "Tradesman Tvlakv"Shallan refused to call him "Trademaster," as would be his proper title as a full merchant"I would hear your discussion." "Of course, Brightness, of course." He waddled over, wringing his hands. "You have seen the smoke ahead. We have entered a corridor running between the Shattered Plains and the Shallow Crypts and its sister villages. There is more traffic here than in other parts of the Frostlands, you see. So it is not unexpected that we should encounter others . . ." "Those ahead?" "Another caravan, if we are lucky." And if we're unlucky . . . She didn't need to ask. It would mean more deserters or bandits. "We can avoid them," Tvlakv said. "Only a large group would dare make smoke for midday meals, as it is an invitationor a warning. The small caravans, like ourselves, do not risk it." "If it's a large caravan," Tag said, rubbing his brow with a thick finger, "they'll have guards. Good protection." He looked southward. "Yes," Tvlakv said. "But we could also be placing ourselves between two enemies. Danger on all sides . . ." "Those behind will catch us, Tvlakv," Shallan said. "I" "A man hunting game will return with a mink if there are no telm to be found," she said. "Those deserters have to kill to survive out here. Didn't you say there was probably going to be a highstorm tonight?" "Yes," Tvlakv said, reluctant. "Two hours after sunset, if the list I bought is correct." "I don't know how bandits normally weather the storms," Shallan said, "but they've obviously committed to chasing us down. I'd bet they plan to use the wagons as shelter after killing us. They're not going to let us go." "Perhaps," Tvlakv said. "Yes, perhaps. But Brightness, if we see that second column of smoke ahead, so might the deserters. . . ." "Yeah," Tag said, nodding, as if he'd only just realized it. "We cut east. The killers might go after the group ahead." "We let them attack someone else instead of us?" Shallan said, folding her arms. "What else would you expect us to do, Brightness?" Tvlakv said, exasperated. "We are small cremlings, you see. Our only choice is to keep away from larger creatures and hope for them to hunt one another." Shallan narrowed her eyes, inspecting that small column of smoke ahead. Was it her eyes, or was it growing thicker? She looked backward. Actually, the columns looked to be about the same size. They won't hunt prey their own size, Shallan thought. They left the army, ran away. They're cowards. Nearby, she could see Bluth looking backward as well, watching that smoke with an expression she couldn't read. Disgust? Longing? Fear? No spren to give her a clue. Cowards, she thought again, or just men disillusioned? Rocks who started rolling down a hillside, only to start going so quickly they don't know how to stop? It didn't matter. Those rocks would crush Shallan and the others, if given the chance. Cutting eastward wouldn't work. The deserters would take the easy kill slowmoving wagonsinstead of the potentially harder kill straight ahead. "We make for the second column of smoke," Shallan said, sitting down. Tvlakv looked at her. "You don't get to" He broke off as she met his eyes. "You . . ." Tvlakv said, licking his lips. "You won't get . . . to the Shattered Plains as quickly, Brightness, if we get tied up with a larger caravan, you see. It could be bad." "I will deal with that if the problem arises, tradesman Tvlakv." "Those ahead will keep moving," Tvlakv warned. "We may arrive at that camp and find them gone." "In which case," Shallan said, "they will either be moving toward the Shattered Plains or coming this way, along the corridor toward the port cities. We will intersect them eventually one way or another." Tvlakv sighed, then nodded, calling to Tag to hurry. Shallan sat down, feeling a thrill. Bluth returned and took his seat, then shoved a few wizened roots in her direction. Lunch, apparently. Shortly, the wagons began rolling northward, Shallan's wagon falling into place third in line this time. Shallan settled into her seat for the tripthey were hours away from that second group, even if they did manage to catch up to it. To keep from worrying, she finished her sketches of the landscape. She then turned to idle sketches, simply letting her pencil go where it willed. She drew skyeels dancing in the air. She drew the docks of Kharbranth. She did a sketch of Yalb, though the face felt off to her, and she didn't quite capture the mischievous spark in his eyes. Perhaps the errors related to how sad she became, thinking of what had probably happened to him. She flipped the page and started a random sketch, whatever came into her mind. Her pencil moved into a depiction of an elegant woman in a stately gown. Loose but sleek below the waist, tight across the chest and stomach. Long, open sleeves, one hiding the safehand, the other cut at the elbow exposing the forearm and draping down below. A bold, poised woman. In control. Still drawing unconsciously, Shallan added her own face to the elegant woman's head. She hesitated, pencil hovering above the image. That wasn't her. Was it? Could it be? She stared at that image as the wagon bumped over rocks and plants. She flipped to the next page and started another drawing. A ball gown, a woman at court, surrounded by the elite of Alethkar as she imagined them. Tall, strong. The woman belonged among them. Shallan added her face to the figure. She flipped the page and did another one. And then another. The last one was a sketch of her standing at the edge of the Shattered Plains as she imagined them. Looking eastward, toward the secrets that Jasnah had sought. Shallan flipped the page and drew again. A picture of Jasnah on the ship, seated at her desk, papers and books sprawled around her. It wasn't the setting that mattered, but the face. That worried, terrified face. Exhausted, pushed to her limits. Shallan got this one right. The first drawing since the disaster that captured perfectly what she'd seen. Jasnah's burden. "Stop the wagon," Shallan said, not looking up. Bluth glanced at her. She resisted the urge to say it again. He didn't, unfortunately, obey immediately. "Why?" he demanded. Shallan looked up. The smoke column was still distant, but she'd been right, it was growing thicker. The group ahead had stopped and built a sizable fire for the midday meal. Judging by that smoke, they were a much larger group than the one behind. "I'm going to get into the back," Shallan said. "I need to look something up. You can continue when I'm settled, but please stop and call to me once we're near to the group ahead." He sighed, but stopped the chull with a few whacks on the shell. Shallan climbed down, then took the knobweed and notebook, moved to the back of the wagon. Once she was in, Bluth started up again immediately, shouting back to Tvlakv, who had demanded to know the meaning of the delay. With the walls up her wagon was shaded and private, particularly with it being last in line so nobody could look in the back door at her. Unfortunately, riding in the back wasn't as comfortable as riding in the front. Those tiny rockbuds caused a surprising amount of jarring and jolting. Jasnah's trunk was tied in place near the front wall. She opened the lid letting the spheres inside provide dusky illuminationthen settled back on her improvised cushion, a pile of the cloths Jasnah had used to wrap her books. The blanket she used at nightas Tvlakv had been unable to produce one for her was the velvet lining she had ripped out of the trunk. Settling back, she unwrapped her feet to apply the new knobweed. They were scabbed over and much improved from their condition just a day before. "Pattern?" He vibrated from somewhere nearby. She'd asked him to remain in the back so as to not alarm Tvlakv and the guards. "My feet are healing," she said. "Did you do this?" "Mmmm . . . I know almost nothing of why people break. I know less of why they . . . unbreak." "Your kind don't get wounded?" she asked, snapping off a knobweed stem and squeezing the drops onto her left foot. "We break. We just do it . . . differently than men do. And we do not unbreak without aid. I do not know why you unbreak. Why?" "It is a natural function of our bodies," she said. "Living things repair themselves automatically." She held one of her spheres close, searching for signs of little red rotspren. Where she found a few of them along one cut, she was quick to apply sap and chase them off. "I would like to know why things work," Pattern said. "So would many of us," Shallan said, bent over. She grimaced as the wagon hit a particularly large rock. "I made myself glow last night, by the fire with Tvlakv." "Yes." "Do you know why?" "Lies." "My dress changed," Shallan said. "I swear the scuffs and rips were gone last night. They've returned now, though." "Mmm. Yes." "I have to be able to control this thing we can do. Jasnah called it Lightweaving. She implied it was far safer to practice than Soulcasting." "The book?" Shallan frowned, sitting back against the bars on the side of the wagon. Beside her, a long line of scratches on the floor looked like they'd been made by fingernails. As if one of the slaves had tried, in a fit of madness, to claw his way to freedom. The book Jasnah had given her, Words of Radiance, had been swallowed by the ocean. It seemed a greater loss than the other one Jasnah had given her, the Book of Endless Pages, which had strangely been blank. She didn't understand the full significance of that yet. "I never got a chance to actually read that book," Shallan said. "We'll need to see if we can find another copy once we reach the Shattered Plains." Their destination being a warcamp, though, she doubted that many books would be for sale. Shallan held one of her spheres up before herself. It was growing dim, and needed to be reinfused. What would happen if the highstorm came, and they hadn't caught up to the group ahead? Would the deserters push through the storm itself to reach them? And, potentially, the safety of their wagons? Storms, what a mess. She needed an edge. "The Knights Radiant formed a bond with spren," Shallan said, more to herself than to Pattern. "It was a symbiotic relationship, like a little cremling who lives in the shalebark. The cremling cleans off the lichen, getting food, but also keeping the shalebark clean." Pattern buzzed in confusion. "Am I . . . the shalebark or the cremling?" "Either," Shallan said, turning the diamond sphere in her fingersthe tiny gemstone trapped inside glowed with a vigilant light, suspended in glass. "The Surgesthe forces that run the worldare more pliable to spren. Or . . . well . . . since spren are pieces of those Surges, maybe it's that the spren are better at influencing one another. Our bond gives me the ability to manipulate one of the Surges. In this case, light, the power of Illumination." "Lies," Pattern whispered. "And truths." Shallan gripped the sphere in her fist, the light shining through her skin making her hand glow red. She willed the Light to enter her, but nothing happened. "So, how do I make it work?" "Perhaps eat it?" Pattern said, moving over onto the wall beside her head. "Eat it?" Shallan asked, skeptical. "I didn't need to eat it before to get the Stormlight." "Might work, though. Try?" "I doubt I could swallow an entire sphere," Shallan said. "Even if I wanted to, which I distinctly do not." "Mmmm," Pattern said, his vibrations making the wood shake. "This . . . is not one of the things humans like to eat, then?" "Storms, no. Haven't you been paying attention?" "I have," he said with an annoyed zip of a vibration. "But it is difficult to tell! You consume some things, and turn them into other things . . . Very curious things that you hide. They have value? But you leave them. Why?" "We are done with that conversation," Shallan said, opening her fist and holding up the sphere again. Though, admittedly, something about what he said felt right. She hadn't eaten any spheres before, but she had somehow . . . consumed the Light. Like drinking it. She'd breathed it in, right? She stared at the sphere for a moment, then sucked in a sharp breath. It worked. The Light left the sphere, quick as a heartbeat, a bright line streaming into her chest. From there it spread, filling her. The unusual sensation made her feel anxious, alert, ready. Eager to be about . . . something. Her muscles tensed. "It worked," she said, though when she spoke, Stormlightglowing faintly puffed out in front of her. It rose from her skin, too. She had to practice before it all left. Lightweaving . . . She needed to create something. She decided to go with what she'd done before, improving the look of her dress. Again, nothing happened. She didn't know what to do, what muscles to use, or even if muscles mattered. Frustrated, she sat there trying to find a way to make the Stormlight work, feeling inept as it escaped through her skin. It took several minutes for it to dissipate completely. "Well, that was distinctly unimpressive," she said, moving to get more stalks of knobweed. "Maybe I should practice Soulcasting instead." Pattern buzzed. "Dangerous." "So Jasnah told me," Shallan said. "But I don't have her to teach me anymore, and so far as I know, she's the only one who could have done so. It's either practice on my own or never learn to use the ability." She squeezed out another few drops of knobweed sap, moved to massage it into a cut on her foot, then stopped. The wound was noticeably smaller than it had been just moments ago. "The Stormlight is healing me," Shallan said. "It makes you unbreak?" "Yes. Stormfather! I'm doing things almost by accident." "Can something be 'almost' an accident?" Pattern asked, genuinely curious. "This phrase, I do not know what it means." "I . . . Well, it's mostly a figure of speech." Then, before he could ask further, she continued, "And by that I mean something we say to convey an idea or a feeling, but not a literal fact." Pattern buzzed. "What does that mean?" Shallan asked, massaging the knobweed in anyway. "When you buzz like that. What are you feeling?" "Hmmm . . . Excited. Yes. It has been so long since anyone has learned of you and your kind." Shallan squeezed some more sap onto her toes. "You came to learn? Wait . . . you're a scholar?" "Of course. Hmmm. Why else would I come? I will learn so much before" He stopped abruptly. "Pattern?" she asked. "Before what?" "A figure of speech." He said it perfectly flatly, absent of tone. He was growing better and better at speaking like a person, and at times he sounded just like one. But now all of the color had gone from his voice. "You're lying," she accused him, glancing at his pattern on the wall. He had shrunk, growing as small as a fist, half his usual size. "Yes," he said reluctantly. "You're a terrible liar," Shallan said, surprised at the realization. "Yes." "But you love lies!" "So fascinating," he said. "You are all so fascinating." "Tell me what you were going to say," Shallan ordered. "Before you stopped yourself. I'll know if you lie." "Hmmmm. You sound like her. More and more like her." "Tell me." He buzzed with an annoyed sound, quick and high pitched. "I will learn what I can of you before you kill me." "You think . . . You think I'm going to kill you?" "It happened to the others," Pattern said, his voice softer now. "It will happen to me. It is . . . a pattern." "This has to do with the Knights Radiant," Shallan said, raising her hands to start braiding her hair. That would be better than leaving it wildthough without a comb and brush, even braiding it was hard. Storms, she thought, I need a bath. And soap. And a dozen other things. "Yes," Pattern said. "The knights killed their spren." "How? Why?" "Their oaths," Pattern said. "It is all I know. My kind, those who were unbonded, we retreated, and many kept our minds. Even still, it is hard to think apart from my kind, unless . . ." "Unless?" "Unless we have a person." "So that's what you get out of it," Shallan said, untangling her hair with her fingers. "Symbiosis. I get access to Surgebinding, you get thought." "Sapience," Pattern said. "Thought. Life. These are of humans. We are ideas. Ideas that wish to live." Shallan continued working on her hair. "I'm not going to kill you," she said firmly. "I won't do it." "I don't suppose the others intended to either," he said. "But it is no matter." "It is an important matter," Shallan said. "I won't do it. I'm not one of the Knights Radiant. Jasnah made that clear. A man who can use a sword isn't necessarily a soldier. Just because I can do what I do doesn't make me one of them." "You spoke oaths." Shallan froze. Life before death . . . The words drifted toward her from the shadows of her past. A past she would not think of. "You live lies," Pattern said. "It gives you strength. But the truth . . . Without speaking truths you will not be able to grow, Shallan. I know this somehow." She finished with her hair and moved to rewrap her feet. Pattern had moved to the other side of the rattling wagon chamber, settling onto the wall, only faintly visible in the dim light. She had a handful of infused spheres left. Not much Stormlight, considering how quickly that other had left her. Should she use what she had to further heal her feet? Could she even do that intentionally, or would the ability elude her, as Lightweaving had? She tucked the spheres into her safepouch. She would save them, just in case. For now, these spheres and their Light might be the only weapon available to her. Bandages redone, she stood up in the rattling wagon and found that her foot pain was nearly gone. She could walk almost normally, though she still wouldn't want to go far without shoes. Pleased, she knocked on the wood nearest to Bluth. "Stop the wagon!" This time, she didn't have to repeat herself. She rounded the wagon and, taking her seat beside Bluth, immediately noticed the smoke column ahead. It had grown darker, larger, roiling violently. "That's no cook fire," Shallan said. "Aye," Bluth said, expression dark. "Something big is burning. Probably wagons." He glanced at her. "Whoever is up there, it doesn't look like things went well for them." Scholarform shown for patience and thought. Beware its ambitions innate. Though study and diligence bring the reward, Loss of innocence may be one's fate. From the Listener Song of Listing, 69th stanza "New guys are coming along, gancho," Lopen said, taking a bite of the paperwrapped something he was eating. "Wearing their uniforms, talking like real men. Funny. It only took them a few days. Took us weeks." "It took the rest of the men weeks, but not you," Kaladin said, shading his eyes from the sun and leaning on his spear. He was still on the lighteyes' practice grounds, watching over Adolin and Renarinthe latter of whom was receiving his first instructions from Zahel the swordmaster. "You had a good attitude from the first day we found you, Lopen." "Well, life was pretty good, you know?" "Pretty good? You'd just been assigned to carry siege bridges until you died on the plateaus." "Eh," Lopen said, taking a bite of his food. It looked like a thick piece of flatbread wrapped around something goopy. He licked his lips, then handed it to Kaladin to free his single hand so he could dig in his pocket for a moment. "You have bad days. You have good days. Evens out eventually." "You're a strange man, Lopen," Kaladin said, inspecting the "food" Lopen had been eating. "What is this?" "Chouta." "Chowder?" "Chaouta. Herdazian food, gon. Good stuff. You can have a bite, if you want." It seemed to be chunks of undefinable meat slathered in some dark liquid, all wrapped in overly thick bread. "Disgusting," Kaladin said, handing it back as Lopen gave him the thing he'd dug out of his pocket, a shell with glyphs written on both sides. "Your loss," Lopen said, taking another bite. "You shouldn't be walking around eating like that," Kaladin noted. "It's rude." "Nah, it's convenient. See, it's wrapped up good. You can walk about, get stuff done, eat at the same time . . ." "Slovenly," Kaladin said, inspecting the shell. It listed Sigzil's tallies of how many troops they had, how much food Rock thought they'd need, and Teft's assessments of how many of the former bridgemen were fit for training. That last number was pretty high. If bridgemen lived, they got strong carrying bridges. As Kaladin had proven firsthand, that translated to their making fine soldiers, assuming they could be motivated. On the reverse side of the shell, Sigzil had outlined a path for Kaladin to take on patrol outside the warcamps. He'd soon have enough of the greenvines ready to begin patrolling the region outside of the warcamps, as he'd told Dalinar he would do. Teft thought it would be good for Kaladin to go himself, as it would let the new men spend time with Kaladin. "Highstorm tonight," Lopen noted. "Sig says it will come two hours after sunset. He thought you'd want to make preparations." Kaladin nodded. Another chance for those mysterious numbers to appear both times before, they'd come during storms. He'd make extra certain Dalinar and his family were being watched. "Thanks for the report," Kaladin said, tucking the shell into his pocket. "Send back and tell Sigzil his proposed route takes me too far from the warcamps. Have him draw up another one. Also, tell Teft I need a few more men to come here today and relieve Moash and Drehy. They've both been pulling too many hours lately. I'll guard Dalinar tonight myselfsuggest to the highprince it would be convenient if his entire family would be together for the highstorm." "If the winds will, gon," Lopen said, finishing his last bite of chouta. He whistled then, looking in at the practice grounds. "That is something, isn't it?" Kaladin followed Lopen's gaze. Adolin, having left his brother with Zahel, was now executing a training sequence with his Shardblade. Gracefully, he spun and twisted on the sands, sweeping his sword in broad, flowing patterns. On a practiced Shardbearer, Plate never looked clumsy. Imposing, resplendent, it fit to the form of the wearer. Adolin's reflected sunlight like a mirror as he made sweeps of the sword, moving from one posture to the next. Kaladin knew it was just a warmup sequence, more impressive than functional. You'd never do something like this on the battlefield, though many of the individual postures and cuts represented practical movements. Even knowing that, Kaladin had to shake off a feeling of awe. Shardbearers in Plate looked inhuman when they fought, more like Heralds than men. He caught Syl sitting on the edge of the roof overhang near Adolin, watching the young man. She was too distant for Kaladin to make out her expression. Adolin finished his warmup in a move where he fell to one knee and slammed his Shardblade into the ground. It sank up to midblade, then vanished when he released it. "I've seen him summon that weapon before," Kaladin said. "Yeah, gancho, on the battlefield, when we saved his sorry ass from Sadeas." "No, before that," Kaladin said, remembering an incident with a whore in Sadeas's camp. "He saved someone who was being bullied." "Huh," Lopen said. "He can't be too bad then, you know?" "I suppose. Anyway, off with you. Make sure to send that replacement team." Lopen saluted, collecting Shen, who had been poking at practice swords along the side of the courtyard. Together, they jogged off on the errand. Kaladin did his rounds, checking on Moash and the others before walking over to where Renarin satstill armoredon the ground before his new master. Zahel, the ardent with the ancient eyes, sat in a solemn posture that belied his ragged beard. "You will need to relearn how to fight, wearing that Plate. It changes the way a man steps, grips, moves." "I . . ." Renarin looked down. It was very odd to see a man wearing spectacles in the magnificent armor. "I will not need to relearn how to fight, master. I never learned in the first place." Zahel grunted. "That's good. It means I don't have to break down any old, bad habits." "Yes, master." "We'll start you off easily, then," Zahel said. "There are some steps at the corner over there. Climb up onto the roof of the dueling grounds. Then jump off." Renarin looked up sharply. ". . . Jump?" "I'm old, son," Zahel said. "Repeating myself makes me eat the wrong flower." Kaladin frowned, and Renarin cocked his head, then looked at Kaladin questioningly. Kaladin shrugged. "Eat . . . what . . . ?" Renarin asked. "It means I get angry," Zahel snapped. "You people don't have proper idioms for anything. Go!" Renarin sprang to his feet, kicking up sand, and hustled away. "Your helmet, son!" Zahel called. Renarin stopped, then scrambled back and snatched his helmet off the ground, nearly slipping onto his face as he did so. He spun, off balance, and ran awkwardly toward the stairs. He nearly plowed into a pillar on the way. Kaladin snorted softly. "Oh," Zahel said, "and you assume you'd do better your first time wearing Shardplate, bodyguard?" "I doubt I'd forget my helmet," Kaladin said, shouldering his spear and stretching. "If Dalinar Kholin intends to force the other highprinces into line, I think he's going to need better Shardbearers than this. He should have picked someone else for that Plate." "Like you?" "Storms no," Kaladin said, perhaps too vehemently. "I'm a soldier, Zahel. I want nothing to do with Shards. The boy is likable enough, but I wouldn't trust men to his commandlet alone armor that could keep a much better soldier alive on the fieldand that's it." "He'll surprise you," Zahel replied. "I gave him the whole 'I'm your master and you do what I say' talk, and he actually listened." "Every soldier hears that on their first day," Kaladin said. "Sometimes they listen. That the boy did is hardly noteworthy." "If you knew how many spoiled tenyearold lighteyed brats came through here," Zahel said, "you'd think it worth noting. I thought a nineteenyearold like him would be insufferable. And don't call him a boy, boy. He's probably close to your own age, and is the son of the most powerful human on this" He cut off as scraping from atop the building announced Renarin Kholin charging and throwing himself off into the air, boots grinding against the stone coping of the roof. He sailed a good ten or twelve feet out over the courtyard practiced Shardbearers could do far betterbefore floundering like a dying skyeel and crashing down into the sand. Zahel looked toward Kaladin, raising an eyebrow. "What?" Kaladin asked. "Enthusiasm, obedience, no fear of looking foolish," Zahel said. "I can teach him how to fight, but those qualities are innate. This lad is going to do just fine." "Assuming he doesn't fall on anyone," Kaladin said. Renarin climbed to his feet. He looked down, as if surprised that he hadn't broken anything. "Go up and do it again!" Zahel called to Renarin. "This time, fall headfirst!" Renarin nodded, then turned and trotted off toward the stairwell. "You want him to be confident in how the Plate protects him," Kaladin said. "Part of using Plate is knowing its limits," Zahel said, turning back to Kaladin. "Plus, I just want him moving in it. Either way he's listening, and that's good. Teaching him is going to be a real pleasure. You, on the other hand, are another story." Kaladin raised his hand. "Thanks, but no." "You'd turn down an offer to train with a full weapons master?" Zahel asked. "I can count on one hand the number of darkeyes I've seen given that chance." "Yes, well, I've already done the 'new recruit' thing. Yelled at by sergeants, worked to the bone, marched for hours on end. Really, I'm fine." "This isn't the same at all," Zahel said, waving down one of the ardents walking past. The man was carrying a Shardblade with metal guards over the sharp edges, one of the ones the king provided for training use. Zahel took the Shardblade from the ardent, holding it up. Kaladin nodded his chin at it. "What's that on the Blade?" "Nobody's sure," Zahel said, swiping with the Blade. "Fit it to the edges of a Blade, and it will adapt to the shape of the weapon and make it safely blunt. Off the weapons, they break surprisingly easily. Useless in a fight on their own. Perfect for training, though." Kaladin grunted. Something created long ago, for use in training? Zahel inspected the Shardblade for a moment, then pointed it directly toward Kaladin. Even with it bluntedeven knowing the man wasn't going to really attack himKaladin felt an immediate moment of panic. A Shardblade. This one had a slender, sleek form with a large crossguard. The flat sides of the blade were etched with the ten fundamental glyphs. It was a handspan wide and easily six feet long, yet Zahel held it with one hand and didn't seem off balance. "Niter," Zahel said. "What?" Kaladin asked, frowning. "He was head of the Cobalt Guard before you," Zahel said. "He was a good man, and a friend. He died keeping the men of the Kholin house alive. Now you've got the same Damnation job, and you're going to have a tough time doing it half as well as he did." "I don't see what that has to do with you waving a Shardblade at me." "Anyone who sends assassins after Dalinar or his sons is going to be powerful," Zahel said. "They'll have access to Shardbearers. That's what you're up against, son. You're going to need far more training than a battlefield gives a spearman. Have you ever fought a man holding one of these?" "Once or twice," Kaladin said, relaxing against the nearby pillar. "Don't lie to me." "I'm not lying," Kaladin said, meeting Zahel's eyes. "Ask Adolin what I pulled his father out of a few weeks back." Zahel lowered the sword. Behind him, Renarin dove facefirst off the roof and crashed into the ground. He groaned inside his helm, rolling over. His helm leaked Light but he seemed otherwise unharmed. "Well done, Prince Renarin," Zahel called without looking. "Now do a few more jumps and see if you can land on your feet." Renarin rose and clinked off. "All right then," Zahel said, sweeping the Shardblade in the air. "Let's see what you can do, kid. Convince me to leave you alone." Kaladin didn't respond other than to heft his spear and settle into a defensive posture, one foot behind, one out front. He held his weapon with the butt forward instead of the point. Nearby, Adolin sparred with another one of the masters, who had the second King's Blade and a suit of Plate. How would this work? If Zahel scored a hit on Kaladin's spear, would they pretend it had cut through? The ardent approached in a rush, raising the Blade in a twohanded grip. The familiar calmness and focus of battle enveloped Kaladin. He did not draw in Stormlight. He needed to be certain not to come to rely on it too much. Watch that Shardblade, Kaladin thought, stepping forward, trying to get inside the weapon's reach. In fighting a Shardbearer, everything became about that Blade. The Blade that nothing could stop, the Blade that didn't just kill the body but severed the soul itself. The Blade Zahel dropped the Blade. It hit the ground as Zahel got inside Kaladin's reach. Kaladin had been too focused on the weapon, and though he tried to get his spear in position to strike, Zahel twisted and buried his fist into Kaladin's stomach. The next punchto the faceslammed Kaladin to the floor of the practice grounds. Kaladin immediately rolled, ignoring the painspren wiggling in the sand. He found his feet as his vision swam. He grinned. "Nice move, that." Zahel was already turning back to Kaladin, Blade recovered. Kaladin scuttled backward on the sand, spear still forward, staying away. Zahel knew his way around a Blade. He didn't fight like Adolin; fewer sweeping blows, more overhand chops. Quick and furious. He backed Kaladin around the side of the practice ground. He'll get tired keeping this up, Kaladin's instincts said. Keep him moving. After an almost complete circuit of the grounds, Zahel slowed his offense and instead rounded on Kaladin, watching for an opening. "You'd be in trouble if I had Plate," Zahel said. "I'd be faster, wouldn't tire." "You don't have Plate." "And if someone comes for the king wearing it?" "I'll use a different tactic." Zahel grunted as Renarin crashed to the ground nearby. The prince almost kept his footing, but stumbled and fell to the side, skidding in the sand. "Well, if this were a real assassination attempt," Zahel said, "I'd be using different tactics too." He dashed toward Renarin. Kaladin cursed, taking off after Zahel. Immediately, the man reversed, skidding to a stop in the sand and spinning to swing at Kaladin with a powerful twohanded blow. The strike connected with Kaladin's spear, sending a sharp crack echoing across the practice grounds. If the Blade hadn't been guarded, it would have split the spear in two and perhaps grazed Kaladin's chest. A watching ardent tossed Kaladin half a spear. They'd been waiting for his spear to be "cut," and wanted to replicate a real fight as much as possible. Nearby, Moash had arrived, looking concerned, but several ardents intercepted him and explained. Kaladin looked back to Zahel. "In a real fight," the man said, "I might have chased down the prince by now." "In a real fight," Kaladin said, "I might have stabbed you with half a spear when you thought me disarmed." "I wouldn't have made that mistake." "Then we'll have to assume I wouldn't have made the mistake of letting you get to Renarin." Zahel grinned. It looked a dangerous expression on him. He stepped forward, and Kaladin understood. There would be no backing away and leading him off this time. Kaladin wouldn't have that option if he were protecting a member of Dalinar's family. Instead, he had to try his best to pretend to kill this man. That meant an attack. A prolonged, closequarters fight would favor Zahel, as Kaladin couldn't parry a Shardblade. Kaladin's best bet was to strike fast and hope to score an early hit. Kaladin barreled forward, then threw himself to his knees, skidding on the sands underneath Zahel's strike. That would get him close, and Zahel kicked Kaladin in the face. Vision swimming, Kaladin rammed his fake spear into Zahel's leg. The man's Shardblade came down a second later, stopping where Kaladin's shoulder met his neck. "You're dead, son," Zahel said. "You've got a spear through the leg," Kaladin said, puffing. "You aren't chasing down Renarin like that. I win." "You're still dead," Zahel said with a grunt. "My job is to stop you from killing Renarin. With what I just did, he escapes. Doesn't matter if the bodyguard is dead." "And what if the assassin had a friend?" another voice asked from behind. Kaladin twisted to see Adolin, in full Plate and standing with his Shardblade point stuck into the ground before him. He'd removed his helm, and held it in one hand, the other hand resting on the Blade's crossguard. "If there were two of them, bridgeboy?" Adolin asked with a smirk. "Could you fight two Shardbearers at once? If I wanted to kill Father or the king, I'd never send just one." Kaladin stood, rolling his shoulder in its socket. He met Adolin's gaze. So condescending. So sure of himself. Arrogant bastard. "All right," Zahel said. "I'm sure he sees the point, Adolin. No need" Kaladin charged the princeling, and he thought he heard Adolin chuckling as he put on his helm. Something boiled inside of Kaladin. The nameless Shardbearer who had killed so many of his friends. Sadeas, sitting regally in red armor. Amaram, hands on a sword stained with blood. Kaladin screamed as Adolin's unguarded Shardblade came for him in one of the careful, sweeping strokes from Adolin's practice session. Kaladin pulled himself up short, raising his halfspear and letting the Blade pass right before him. Then he slapped the back edge of the Shardblade with his spear, knocking Adolin's grip to the side and fouling up the followthrough. Kaladin barreled forward and threw his shoulder against the prince. It was like slamming into a wall. Kaladin's shoulder flared with pain, but the momentum along with the surprise of his cudgel blowknocked Adolin off balance. Kaladin forced both of them backward, the Shardbearer toppling to the ground with a crash and a surprised grunt. Renarin made a twin crash, falling to the ground nearby. Kaladin raised his halfspear like a dagger to plunge it toward Adolin's faceplate. Unfortunately, Adolin had dismissed his Blade as they fell. The princeling got a gauntleted hand up underneath Kaladin. Kaladin slammed his weapon downward. Adolin heaved upward with one hand. Kaladin's blow didn't connect; instead he found himself airborne, thrown with all the Plateaugmented strength of a Shardbearer. He floundered in the air before slamming down eight feet away, the sand grinding into his side, the shoulder he'd hit against Adolin flaring in pain again. Kaladin gasped. "Idiot!" Zahel yelled. Kaladin groaned, rolling over. His vision swam. "You could have killed the boy!" He was talking to Adolin somewhere far away. "He attacked me!" Adolin's voice was muffled by the helm. "You challenged him, fool child." Zahel's voice was closer. "Then he asked for it," Adolin said. Pain. Someone at Kaladin's side. Zahel? "You're wearing Plate, Adolin." Yes, that was Zahel kneeling above Kaladin, whose vision refused to focus. "You don't throw an unarmored sparring partner like he's a bundle of sticks. Your father taught you better than that!" Kaladin sucked in sharply and forced his eyes open. Stormlight from the pouch at his belt filled him. Not too much. Don't let them see. Don't let them take it away from you! Pain vanished. His shoulder reknithe didn't know if he'd broken it or just dislocated it. Zahel cried out in surprise as Kaladin pitched himself up to his feet and dashed back toward Adolin. The prince stumbled away, hand out to his side, obviously summoning his Blade. Kaladin kicked his fallen halfspear up in a spray of sand, then grabbed it in midair as he got near. In that moment, the strength drained from him. The tempest inside of him fled without warning, and he stumbled, gasping at the returning pain of his shoulder. Adolin caught him by the arm with a gauntleted fist. The prince's Shardblade formed in his other hand, but in that moment, a second Blade stopped at Kaladin's neck. "You're dead," Zahel said from behind, holding the Blade against Kaladin's skin. "Again." Kaladin sank down in the middle of the practice grounds, dropping his halfspear. He felt completely drained. What had happened? "Go give your brother some help with his jumping," Zahel ordered Adolin. Why did he get to order around princes? Adolin left and Zahel knelt beside Kaladin. "You don't flinch when someone swings a Blade at you. You actually have fought Shardbearers before, haven't you?" "Yeah." "You're lucky to be alive, then," Zahel said, probing at Kaladin's shoulder. "You've got tenacity. A stupid amount of it. You have good form, and you think well in a fight. But you hardly know what you're doing against Shardbearers." "I . . ." What should he say? Zahel was right. It was arrogant to say otherwise. Two fightsthree, if he counted todaydid not make one an expert. He winced as Zahel prodded a sore tendon. More painspren on the ground. He was giving them a workout today. "Nothing broken here," Zahel said with a grunt. "How are your ribs?" "They're fine," Kaladin said, lying back in the sand, staring up at the sky. "Well, I won't force you to learn," Zahel said, standing up. "I don't think I could force you, actually." Kaladin squeezed his eyes shut. He felt humiliated, but why should he? He'd lost sparring matches before. It happened all the time. "You remind me a lot of him," Zahel said. "Adolin wouldn't let me teach him either. Not at first." Kaladin opened his eyes. "I'm nothing like him." Zahel barked a laugh at that, then stood and walked away, chuckling, as if he'd heard the finest joke in all the world. Kaladin continued to lie on the sand, staring upward at the deep blue sky, listening to the sounds of men sparring. Eventually, Syl flitted over and landed on his chest. "What happened?" Kaladin asked. "The Stormlight drained from me. I felt it go." "Who were you protecting?" Syl asked. "I . . . I was practicing how to fight, like when I practiced with Skar and Rock down in the chasms." "Is that really what you were doing?" Syl asked. He didn't know. He lay there, staring at the sky, until he finally caught his breath and forced himself to his feet with a groan. He dusted himself off, then went to check on Moash and the other guards. As he went, he drew in a little Stormlight, and it worked, slowly healing his shoulder and soothing away his bruises. The physical ones, at least. FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO The silk of Shallan's new dress was softer than any she had owned before. It touched her skin like a comforting breeze. The left cuff clipped closed over the hand; she was old enough now to cover her safehand. She had once dreamed of wearing a woman's dress. Her mother and she . . . Her mother . . . Shallan's mind went still. Like a candle suddenly snuffed, she stopped thinking. She leaned back in her chair, legs tucked up underneath her, hands in her lap. The dreary stone dining chamber bustled with activity as Davar Manor prepared for guests. Shallan did not know which guests, only that her father wanted the place immaculate. Not that she could do anything to help. Two maids bustled past. "She saw," one whispered softly to the other, a new woman. "Poor thing was in the room when it happened. Hasn't spoken a word in five months. The master killed his own wife and her lover, but don't let it . . ." They continued talking, but Shallan didn't hear. She kept her hands in her lap. Her dress's vibrant blue was the only real color in the room. She sat on the dais, beside the high table. A halfdozen maids in brown, wearing gloves on their safehands, scrubbed the floor and polished the furniture. Parshmen carted in a few more tables. A maid threw open the windows, letting in damp fresh air from the recent highstorm. Shallan caught mention of her name again. The maids apparently thought that because she didn't speak, she didn't hear either. At times, she wondered if she was invisible. Perhaps she wasn't real. That would be nice. . . . The door to the hall slammed open, and Nan Helaran entered. Tall, muscular, squarechinned. Her oldest brother was a man. The rest of them . . . they were children. Even Tet Balat, who had reached the age of adulthood. Helaran scanned the chamber, perhaps looking for their father. Then he approached Shallan, a small bundle under his arm. The maids made way with alacrity. "Hello, Shallan," Helaran said, squatting down beside her chair. "Here to supervise?" It was a place to be. Father did not like her being where she could not be watched. He worried. "I brought you something," Helaran said, unwrapping his bundle. "I ordered it for you in Northgrip, and the merchant only just passed by." He took out a leather satchel. Shallan took it hesitantly. Helaran's grin was so wide, it practically glowed. It was hard to frown in a room where he was smiling. When he was around, she could almost pretend . . . Almost pretend . . . Her mind went blank. "Shallan?" he asked, nudging her. She undid the satchel. Inside was a sheaf of drawing paper, the thick kind the expensive kindand a set of charcoal pencils. She raised her covered safehand to her lips. "I've missed your drawings," Helaran said. "I think you could be very good, Shallan. You should practice more." She ran the fingers of her right hand across the paper, then picked up a pencil. She started to sketch. It had been too long. "I need you to come back, Shallan," Helaran said softly. She hunched over, pencil scratching on paper. "Shallan?" No words. Just drawing. "I'm going to be away a lot in the next few years," Helaran said. "I need you to watch the others for me. I'm worried about Balat. I gave him a new axehound pup, and he . . . wasn't kind to it. You need to be strong, Shallan. For them." The maids had grown quiet since Helaran's arrival. Lethargic vines curled down outside the window nearby. Shallan's pencil continued to move. As if she weren't doing the drawing; as if it were coming up out of the page, the charcoal seeping out of the texture. Like blood. Helaran sighed, standing. Then he saw what she was drawing. Bodies, facedown, on the floor with He grabbed the paper and crumpled it. Shallan started, pulling back, fingers shaking as she clutched the pencil. "Draw plants," Helaran said, "and animals. Safe things, Shallan. Don't dwell on what happened." Tears trickled down her cheeks. "We can't have vengeance yet," Helaran said softly. "Balat can't lead the house, and I must be away. Soon, though." The door slammed open. Father was a big man, bearded in careless defiance of fashion. His Veden clothing eschewed the modern designs. Instead, Father wore a skirtlike garment of silk called an ulatu and a tight shirt with a robe over the top. No mink pelts, as his grandfathers might have worn, but otherwise very, very traditional. He towered taller than Helaran, taller than anyone else on the estate. More parshmen entered after him, carrying bundles of food for the kitchens. All three had marbled skin, two red on black and one red on white. Father liked parshmen. They did not talk back. "I got word that you told the stable to prepare one of my carriages, Helaran!" Father bellowed. "I'll not have you gallivanting off again!" "There are more important things in this world," Helaran said. "More important even than you and your crimes." "Do not speak that way to me," Father said, stalking forward, finger pointed at Helaran. "I am your father." Maids scurried to the side of the room, trying to stay out of the way. Shallan pulled the satchel up against her chest, trying to hide in her chair. "You are a murderer," Helaran said calmly. Father stopped in place, face gone red beneath his beard. He then continued forward. "How dare you! You think I can't have you imprisoned? Because you're my heir, you think I" Something formed in Helaran's hand, a line of mist that coalesced into silvery steel. A Blade some six feet long, curved and thick, with the side that wasn't sharp rising into a shape like burning flames or perhaps ripples of water. It had a gemstone set at the pommel, and as light reflected off the metal, the ridges seemed to move. Helaran was a Shardbearer. Stormfather! How? When? Father cut off, pulling up short. Helaran hopped down from the low dais, then leveled the Shardblade at his father. The point touched Father's chest. Father raised his hands to the sides, palms forward. "You are a vile corruption upon this house," Helaran said. "I should shove this through your chest. To do so would be a mercy." "Helaran . . ." The passion seemed to have bled from Father, like the color from his face, which had gone stark white. "You don't know what you think you know. Your mother" "I will not listen to your lies," Helaran said, rotating his wrist, twisting the sword in his hand, point still against Father's chest. "So easy." "No," Shallan whispered. Helaran cocked his head, then turned, not moving the sword. "No," Shallan said, "please." "You speak now?" Helaran said. "To defend him?" He laughed. A wild bark of a noise. He whipped the sword away from Father's chest. Father sat down in a dining chair, face still pale. "How? A Shardblade. Where?" He glanced suddenly upward. "But no. It's different. Your new friends? They trust you with this wealth?" "We have an important work to do," Helaran said, turning and striding to Shallan. He laid a hand fondly on her shoulder. He continued more softly. "I will tell you of it someday, Sister. It is good to hear your voice again before I leave." "Don't go," she whispered. The words felt like gauze in her mouth. It had been months since she'd last spoken. "I must. Please do some drawings for me while I'm gone. Of fanciful things. Of brighter days. Can you do that?" She nodded. "Farewell, Father," Helaran said, turning and striding from the room. "Try not to ruin too much while I'm gone. I will come back periodically to check." His voice echoed in the hallway outside as he left. Brightlord Davar stood, roaring. The few maids left in the room fled out the side door into the gardens. Shallan shrank back, horrified, as her father picked up his chair and slammed it into the wall. He kicked over a small dining table, then took the chairs one at a time and smashed them into the floor with repeated, brutal blows. Breathing deeply, he turned his eyes on her. Shallan whimpered at the rage, the lack of humanity, in his eyes. As they focused on her, the life returned to them. Father dropped a broken chair and turned his back toward her, as if ashamed, before fleeing the room. Artform applied for beauty and hue. One yearns for the songs it creates. Most misunderstood by the artist it's true, Come the spren to foundation's fates. From the Listener Song of Listing, 90th stanza The sun was a smoldering ember on the horizon, sinking toward oblivion, as Shallan and her little caravan neared the source of the smoke in front of them. Though the column had dwindled, she could now make out that it had three different sources, rising into the air and twisting into one. She climbed to her feet on the rocking wagon as they rolled up one last hill, then stopped on the side, mere feet away from letting her see what was out there. Of course; cresting the hill would be a very bad idea if bandits waited below. Bluth climbed down from his wagon and jogged forward. He wasn't terribly nimble, but he was the best scout they had. He crouched and removed his toofine hat, then made his way up the hillside to peek over. A moment later, he stood up straight, no longer attempting stealth. Shallan hopped down from her seat and hurried over, skirts catching on the twisted branches of crustspines here and there. She reached the top of the hill just before Tvlakv did. Three caravan wagons smoldered quietly below, and the signs of a battle littered the ground. Fallen arrows, a group of corpses in a pile. Shallan's heart leaped as she saw the living among the dead. A scattering of tired figures combed through the rubble or moved bodies. They weren't dressed like bandits, but like honest caravan workers. Five more wagons were clustered on the far side of the camp. Some were scorched, but they all looked functional and still laden with goods. Armed men and women tended their wounds. Guards. A group of frightened parshmen cared for the chulls. These people had been attacked, but they had survived. "Kelek's breath . . ." Tvlakv said. He turned and shooed Bluth and Shallan backward. "Back, before they see." "What?" Bluth said, though he obeyed. "But it's another caravan, as we'd hoped." "Yes, and they needn't know we are here. They might want to speak to us, and that could slow us. Look!" He pointed backward. In the waning light, Shallan could make out a shadow cresting a hill not far behind them. The deserters. She waved for Tvlakv to surrender his spyglass, and he did so reluctantly. The lens was cracked, but Shallan still got a good look at the force. The thirty or so men were soldiers, as Bluth had reported. They flew no banner, and did not march in formation or wear one uniform, but they looked well equipped. "We need to go down and ask the other caravan for help," Shallan said. "No!" Tvlakv said, snatching the spyglass back. "We need to flee! The bandits will see this richer but weakened group and will fall upon them instead of us!" "And you think they won't chase us after that?" Shallan said. "With our tracks so easily visible? You think they won't run us down in the following days?" "There should be a highstorm tonight," Tvlakv said. "It might cover our tracks, blowing away the shells of the plants we crush." "Unlikely," Shallan said. "If we stand with this new caravan, we can add our little strength to theirs. We can hold. It" Bluth held up a hand suddenly, turning. "A noise." He spun around, reaching for his cudgel. A figure stood up nearby, hidden by shadows. Apparently, the caravan below had a scout of its own. "You led them right toward us, did you?" asked a woman's voice. "What are they? More bandits?" Tvlakv held up his sphere, which revealed the scout to be a lighteyed woman of medium height and wiry build. She wore trousers and a long coat that almost looked like a dress, buckled at the waist. She wore a tan glove over her safehand, and spoke Alethi without an accent. "I . . ." Tvlakv said. "I am just a humble merchant, and" "The ones chasing us are certainly bandits," Shallan cut in. "They have chased us all day." The woman cursed, raising a spyglass of her own. "Good equipment," she mumbled. "Deserters, I'd guess. As if this weren't bad enough. Yix!" A second figure stood up nearby, wearing tan clothing the color of stone. Shallan jumped. How had she missed spotting him? He was so close! He had a sword at his waist. A lighteyes? No, a foreigner, judging by that golden hair. She never was sure what eye color meant for their social standing. There weren't people with light eyes in the Makabaki region, though they had kings, and practically everyone in Iri had light yellow eyes. He jogged over, hand on his weapon, watching Bluth and Tag with overt hostility. The woman said something to him in a tongue Shallan didn't know, and he nodded, then jogged off toward the caravan below. The woman followed. "Wait," Shallan called to her. "I don't have time to talk," the woman snapped. "We've got two bandit groups to fight." "Two?" Shallan said. "You didn't defeat the one that attacked you earlier?" "We fought them off, but they'll be back soon." The woman hesitated on the side of the hill. "The fire was an accident, I think. They were using flaming brands to scare us. They pulled back to let us fight the fires, as they didn't want to lose any more goods." Two forces, then. Bandits ahead and behind. Shallan found herself sweating in the cold air as the sun finally vanished beneath the western horizon. The woman was looking northward, toward where her group of bandits must have retreated. "Yeah, they'll be back," the woman said. "They'll want to be done with us before the storm comes tonight." "I offer you my protection," Shallan found herself saying. "Your protection?" the woman said, turning back to Shallan, sounding baffled. "You may accept me and mine into your camp," Shallan said. "I will see to your safety tonight. I will need your service after that to convey me to the Shattered Plains." The woman laughed. "You are gutsy, whoever you are. You can join our camp, but you'll die there with the rest of us!" Cries rose from the caravan. A second later, a flight of arrows fell through the night from that direction, pelting wagons and caravan workers. Screams. Bandits followed, emerging from the blackness. They weren't nearly as well equipped as the deserters, but they didn't need to be. The caravan had fewer than a dozen guards left. The woman cursed and started running down the hillside. Shallan shivered, eyes wide at the sudden slaughter below. Then she turned and walked to Tvlakv's wagons. This sudden chill was familiar to her. The coldness of clarity. She knew what she had to do. She didn't know if it would work, but she saw the solutionlike lines in a drawing, coming together to transform random scribbles into a full picture. "Tvlakv," she said, "take Tag below and try to help those people fight." "What!" he said. "No. No, I will not throw my life away for your foolishness." She met his eyes in the near darkness, and he stopped. She knew that she was glowing softly; she could feel the storm within. "Do it." She left him and walked to her wagon. "Bluth, turn this wagon around." He stood with a sphere beside the wagon, looking down at something in his hand. A sheet of paper? Surely Bluth of all people didn't know glyphs. "Bluth!" Shallan snapped, climbing into the wagon. "We need to be moving. Now!" He shook himself, then tucked the paper away and scrambled into the seat beside her. He whipped at the chull, turning it. "What are we doing?" he asked. "Heading south." "Into the bandits?" "Yes." For once, he did as she told him without complaint, whipping the chull faster as if he were eager to just get this all over with. The wagon rattled and shook as they went down one hillside, then climbed another. They reached the top and looked down at the force climbing toward them. The men carried torches and sphere lanterns, so she could see their faces. Dark expressions on grim men with weapons drawn. Their breastplates or leather jerkins might once have held symbols of allegiance, but she could see where those had been cut or scratched away. The deserters looked at her with obvious shock. They had not expected their prey to come to them. Her arrival stunned them for a moment. An important moment. There will be an officer, Shallan thought, standing up on her seat. They are soldiers, or once were. They'll have a command structure. She took a deep breath. Bluth raised his sphere, looking at her, and grunted as if surprised. "Bless the Stormfather that you're here!" Shallan cried to the men. "I need your help desperately." The group of deserters just stared at her. "Bandits," Shallan said. "They're attacking our friends in the caravan just two hills over. It's a slaughter! I said I'd seen soldiers back here, moving toward the Shattered Plains. Nobody believed me. Please. You must help." Again, they just stared at her. A little like the mink wandering into the whitespine's den and asking when dinner is . . . she thought. Finally, the men shuffled uneasily and turned toward a man near the center. Tall, bearded, he had arms that looked too long for his body. "Bandits, you say," the man replied, voice empty of emotion. Shallan leaped down from the wagon and walked toward the man, leaving Bluth sitting as a silent lump. Deserters stepped away from her, wearing ripped and dirty clothing, with grizzled, unkempt hair and faces that hadn't seen a razor or a washclothin ages. And yet, by torchlight, their weapons gleamed without a spot of rust and their breastplates were polished to the point where they reflected her features. The woman she glimpsed in one breastplate looked too tall, too stately, to be Shallan herself. Instead of tangled hair, she had flowing red locks. Instead of refugee rags, she wore a gown woven with golden embroidery. She had not been wearing a necklace before, and when she raised her hand toward the leader of the band, her chipped fingernails appeared perfectly manicured. "Brightness," the man said as she stepped up to him, "we aren't what you think we are." "No," Shallan replied. "You aren't what you think yourselves to be." Those around her in the firelight regarded her with eager stares, and she felt the hair rising in a shiver across her body. Into the predator's den indeed. Yet the tempest within her spurred her to action, and urged her to greater confidence. The leader opened his mouth as if to give some order. Shallan cut him off. "What is your name?" "I'm called Vathah," the man said, turning toward his allies. It was a Vorin name, like Shallan's own. "And I'll decide what to do with you later. Gaz, take this one and" "What would you do, Vathah," Shallan said in a loud voice, "to erase the past?" He looked back toward her, face lit on one side by primal torchlight. "Would you protect instead of kill, if you had the choice?" Shallan asked. "Would you rescue instead of rob if you could do it over again? Good people are dying as we speak here. You can stop it." Those dark eyes of his seemed dead. "We can't change the past." "I can change your future." "We are wanted men." "Yes, I came here wanting men. Hoping to find men. You are offered the chance to be soldiers again. Come with me. I will see to it you have new lives. Those lives start by saving instead of killing." Vathah snorted in derision. His face looked unfinished in the night, rough, like a sketch. "Brightlords have failed us in the past." "Listen," Shallan said. "Listen to the screams." The piteous sounds reached them from behind her. Shouts for help. Workers, both men and women, from the caravan. Dying. Haunting sounds. Shallan was surprised, despite having pointed them out, how well the sounds carried. How much they sounded like pleas for help. "Give yourself another chance," Shallan said softly. "If you return with me, I will see that your crimes are erased. I promise it to you, by all that I have, by the Almighty himself. You can start over. Start over as heroes." Vathah held her eyes. This man was stone. She could see, with a sinking feeling, that he wasn't swayed. The tempest inside of her began to fade away, and her fears boiled higher. What was she doing? This was crazy! Vathah looked away from her again, and she knew she'd lost him. He barked the order to take her captive. Nobody moved. Shallan had focused only on him, not the other two dozen or so men, who had drawn in close, torches raised high. They looked at her with open faces, and she saw very little of the lust she'd noticed before. Instead, they bore wide eyes, longing, reacting to the distant yells. Men fingered their uniforms, where the insignias had been. Others looked down at spears and axes, weapons of their service perhaps not so long ago. "You fools are considering this?" Vathah said. One man, a short fellow with a scarred face and an eye patch, nodded his head. "I wouldn't mind starting over," he muttered. "Storms, but it would be nice." "I saved a woman's life once," another said, a tall, balding man who was easily into his forties. "I felt a hero for weeks. Toasts in the tavern. Warmth. Damnation! We're dying out here." "We left to get away from their oppression!" Vathah bellowed. "And what have we done with our freedom, Vathah?" a man asked from the back of the group. In the silence that followed, Shallan could hear only the screams for help. "Storm it, I'm going," said the short man with the eye patch, jogging up the hill. Others broke off and followed him. Shallan turnedhands clasped in front of heras nearly the entire group took off in a charge. Bluth stood up on his wagon, his shocked face showing in the torchlight that passed. Then he actually whooped, jumping down from the wagon and raising his cudgel high as he joined the deserters charging toward the battle. Shallan was left with Vathah and two other men. Those seemed dumbfounded by what had just happened. Vathah folded his arms, letting out an audible sigh. "Idiots, every one." "They are not idiots for wanting to be better than they are," Shallan said. He snorted, looking her over. She had an immediate flash of fear. Moments ago, this man was ready to rob her and probably worse. He didn't make any moves toward her, though his face looked even more threatening now that most of the torches had gone. "Who are you?" he asked. "Shallan Davar." "Well, Brightness Shallan," he said, "I hope for your sake you can keep your word. Come on, boys. Let's see if we can keep those fools alive." He left with the others who had remained behind, marching up over the hill toward the fighting. Shallan stood alone in the night, exhaling softly. No Light came out; she'd used it all. Her feet were no longer so much as sore, but she felt exhausted, drained like a punctured wineskin. She walked to the wagon and slumped against it, then finally settled down on the ground. Head back, she looked up at the sky. A few exhaustionspren rose around her, little swirls of dust spinning into the air. Salas, the first moon, made a violet disc in the center of a cluster of bright white stars. The screams and yells of fighting continued. Would the deserters be enough? She didn't know how many bandits there were. She'd be useless there, only getting in the way. She squeezed her eyes shut, then climbed up into the seat and took out her sketchbook. To the sounds of the fighting and dying, she sketched the glyphs for a prayer of hope. "They listened," Pattern said, buzzing from beside her. "You changed them." "I can't believe it worked," Shallan said. "Ah . . . You are good with lies." "No, I mean, that was a figure of speech. It seems impossible that they'd actually listen to me. Hardened criminals." "You are lies and truth," Pattern said softly. "They transform." "What does that mean?" It was hard to sketch with only the light of Salas to see by, but she did her best. "You spoke of one Surge, earlier," Pattern said. "Lightweaving, the power of light. But you have something else. The power of transformation." "Soulcasting?" Shallan said. "I didn't Soulcast anyone." "Mmmm. And yet, you transformed them. And yet. Mmmm." Shallan finished her prayer, then held it up, noticing that a previous page had been ripped out of the notebook. Who had done that? She couldn't burn the prayer, but she didn't think the Almighty would mind. She pressed it close to her breast and closed her eyes, waiting until the shouts from below quieted. Mediationform made for peace, it's said. Form of teaching and consolation. When used by the gods, it became instead Form of lies and desolation. From the Listener Song of Listing, 33rd stanza Shallan closed Bluth's eyes, not looking at the rippedout hole in his torso, the bloody entrails. Around her, workers salvaged what they could from the camp. People groaned, though some of those groans cut off as Vathah executed the bandits one by one. Shallan didn't stop him. He did the duty grimly, and as he walked past he didn't look at her. He's thinking these bandits could have easily been him and his men, Shallan thought, looking back down at Bluth, his dead face lit by fires. What separates the heroes from the villains? One speech in the night? Bluth wasn't the only casualty of the assault; Vathah had lost seven soldiers. They had killed over twice that many bandits. Exhausted, Shallan rose, but hesitated as she saw something poking out of Bluth's jacket. She leaned down and pushed the jacket open. There, stuffed in his pocket, was her picture of him. The one that depicted him not as he was, but as she imagined he might once have been. A soldier in an army, in a crisp uniform. Eyes forward, rather than looking down all the time. A hero. When had he taken it from her sketchbook? She slipped it free and folded it, flattening the wrinkles. "I was wrong," she whispered. "You were a fine way to restart my collection, Bluth. Fight well for the Almighty in your sleep, bold one." She rose and looked over the camp. Several of the caravan's parshmen pulled corpses to the fires for burning. Shallan's intervention had rescued the merchants, but not without heavy losses. She hadn't counted, but the toll looked high. Dozens dead, including most of the caravan's guardsamong them the Iriali man from earlier in the night. In her fatigue, Shallan wanted to crawl into her wagon and curl up for sleep. Instead, she went looking for the caravan leaders. The haggard, bloodstained scout from before stood beside a travel table, where she was talking to an older, bearded man in a felt cap. His eyes were blue, and he moved his fingers through his beard as he looked over a list the woman had brought him. Both looked up as Shallan approached. The woman rested a hand on her sword; the man continued to stroke his beard. Nearby, caravan workers sorted through the contents of a wagon that had toppled over, spilling bales of cloth. "And here is our savior," the older man said. "Brightness, the winds themselves cannot speak of your majesty or the wonder of your timely arrival." Shallan didn't feel majestic. She felt tired, sore, and grungy. Her bare feet hidden by the bottom of her skirtshad started to ache again, and her ability to Lightweave was expended. Her dress looked almost as bad as a pauper's, and her hairthough braidedwas an absolute mess. "You are the caravan owner?" Shallan asked. "Macob is my name," he said. She couldn't place his accent. Not Thaylen or Alethi. "You have met my associate Tyn." He nodded toward the woman. "She is head of our guards. Both her soldiers and my goods have . . . dwindled from tonight's encounters." Tyn folded her arms. She still wore her tan coat, and in the light of Macob's spheres, Shallan could see that it was of fine leather. What to make of a woman who dressed like a soldier and wore a sword at her waist? "I've been telling Macob of your offer," Tyn said. "Earlier, on the hill." Macob chuckled, an incongruous sound considering their surroundings. "Offer, she calls it. My associate is under the impression that it was really a threat! These mercenaries obviously work for you. We are wondering what your intention is for this caravan." "The mercenaries didn't work for me before," Shallan said, "but they do now. It took a little persuasion." Tyn raised an eyebrow. "That must have been some mighty fine persuasion, Brightness . . ." "Shallan Davar. All I ask of you is what I said to Tyn before. Accompany me to the Shattered Plains." "Surely your soldiers can do that," Macob said. "You don't need our assistance." I want you here to remind the "soldiers" what they've done, Shallan thought. Her instincts said that the more reminders of civilization the deserters had, the better off she would be. "They are soldiers," Shallan said. "They have no idea how to properly convey a lighteyed woman in comfort. You, however, have nice wagons and goods aplenty. If you can't tell from my humble aspect, I am in dreadful need of a little luxury. I'd rather not arrive at the Shattered Plains looking like a vagabond." "We could use her soldiers," Tyn said. "My own force is reduced to a handful." She inspected Shallan again, this time with curiosity. It wasn't an unfriendly look. "Then we shall make an accord," Macob said, smiling broadly and reaching across the table toward Shallan. "In my gratitude for my life, I shall see you cared for with new apparel and fine foodstuffs for the duration of our travels together. You and your men will ensure our safety the rest of the way, and then we will part, nothing more owed to one another." "Agreed," Shallan said, taking his hand. "I shall allow you to join me, your caravan unto mine." He hesitated. "Your caravan." "Yes." "And your authority, then, I assume?" "You expected otherwise?" He sighed, but shook on the deal. "No, I suppose not. I suppose not." He released her hand, then waved toward a pair of people off at the side of the wagons. Tvlakv and Tag. "And what of those?" "They are mine," Shallan said. "I will deal with them." "Just keep them at the back of the caravan, if you will," Macob said, wrinkling his nose. "Grimy business. I'd rather not our caravan stink of those wares. Either way, you'd best be about gathering your people. There will be a highstorm soon. With our lost wagons, we have no extra shelter." Shallan left them and made her way across the valley, trying to ignore the mingled stench of blood and char. A shape split from the darkness, moving in beside her. Vathah didn't look any less intimidating in the better light here. "Well?" Shallan asked him. "Some of my men are dead," he said, his voice a monotone. "They died doing a very good work," Shallan said, "and the families of these who lived will bless them for their sacrifice." Vathah took her arm, pulling her to a stop. His grip was firm, even painful. "You don't look like you did before," he said. She hadn't realized how much he towered over her. "Did my eyes mistake me? I saw a queen in the darkness. Now I see a child." "Perhaps you saw what your conscience needed you to see," Shallan said, tuggingunsuccessfullyon her arm. She blushed. Vathah leaned in. His breath wasn't particularly sweet. "My men have done worse things than this," he whispered, waving his other hand at the burning dead. "Out in the wilderness, we took. We killed. You think one night absolves us? You think one night will stop the nightmares?" Shallan felt a hollowness in her stomach. "If we go with you to the Shattered Plains, we're dead men," Vathah said. "We'll be hanged the moment we return." "My word" "Your word means nothing, woman!" he shouted, grip tensing. "You should let her go," Pattern said calmly from behind him. Vathah spun, looking about, but they weren't near anyone in particular. Shallan spotted Pattern on the back of Vathah's uniform as he turned. "Who said that?" Vathah demanded. "I heard nothing," Shallan said, somehow managing to sound calm. "You should let her go," Pattern repeated. Vathah looked around again, then back at Shallan, who met his gaze with a level stare. She even forced out a smile. He let go of her and wiped his hand on his trousers, then retreated. Pattern slipped down his back and leg onto the ground, then skimmed toward Shallan. "That one will be trouble," Shallan said, rubbing the place where he'd gripped her. "Is this a figure of speech?" Pattern asked. "No. I mean what I said." "Curious," Pattern said, watching Vathah retreat, "because I think he already is trouble." "True." She continued her way toward Tvlakv, who sat on the seat of his wagon with hands clasped before him. He smiled toward Shallan as she arrived, though the expression seemed particularly thin on him today. "So," he asked conversationally, "were you in on it from the start?" "In on what?" Shallan asked wearily, shooing Tag away so she could talk to Tvlakv in private. "Bluth's plan." "Please, do tell." "Obviously," Tvlakv said, "he was in league with the deserters. That first night, when he came running back to the camp, he'd met with them and promised to let them take us if he could share in the wealth. That was why they did not immediately kill you two when you went to speak with them." "Oh?" Shallan asked. "And if that were the case, why did Bluth come back and warn us that night? Why did he flee with us, instead of just letting his 'friends' kill us right then?" "Perhaps he only met with a few of them," Tvlakv said. "Yes, they lit fires on that hillside in the night to make us think there were more, and then his friends went to gather a larger crowd . . . And . . ." He deflated. "Storms. That doesn't make any sense. But how, why? We should be dead." "The Almighty preserved us," Shallan said. "Your Almighty is a farce." "You should hope he is," Shallan said, walking to the back of Tag's wagon nearby. "For if he is not, then Damnation itself awaits men like you." She inspected the cage. Five slaves in grimy clothing huddled inside, each one looking alone, though they were crammed in close. "These are mine now," Shallan told Tvlakv. "What!" he stood up on his seat. "You" "I saved your life, you oily little man," Shallan said. "You will give me these slaves in payment. Dues in recompense for my soldiers protecting you and your worthless life." "This is robbery." "This is justice. If it bothers you, submit a grievance with the king in the Shattered Plains, once we arrive." "I'm not going to the Shattered Plains," Tvlakv spat. "You have someone else to convey you now, Brightness. I'm heading south, as I originally intended." "Then you'll do so without these," Shallan said, using her keythe one he had given her to get into her wagonto open the cage. "You will give me their writs of slavery. And the Stormfather help you if not everything is in order, Tvlakv. I'm very good at spotting a forgery." She hadn't ever even seen a writ of slavery, and wouldn't know how to tell if one was faked. She didn't care. She was tired, frustrated, and eager to be done with this night. One by one, five hesitant slaves stepped from the wagon, shaggy bearded and shirtless. Her trip with Tvlakv had not been pleasant, but it had been luxurious compared to what these men had been through. Several glanced at the darkness nearby, as if eager. "You may run if you wish," Shallan said, softening her tone. "I will not hunt you. I need servants, however, and I will pay you well. Six firemarks a week if you agree to put five of them toward paying down your slave debt. One if you don't." One of the men cocked his head. "So . . . we take away the same amount either way? What kind of sense does that make?" "The best kind," Shallan said, turning to Tvlakv, who sat stewing on the side of his seat. "You have three wagons but only two drivers. Will you sell me the third wagon?" She wouldn't need the chullMacob would have an extra she could use, since several of his wagons had burned. "Sell the wagon? Bah! Why not just steal it from me?" "Stop being a child, Tvlakv. Do you want my money or not?" "Five sapphire broams," he snapped. "And it's a steal at that price; don't you argue otherwise." She didn't know if it was or not, but she could afford it, with the spheres she had, even if most of them were dun. "You can't have my parshmen," Tvlakv snapped. "You can keep them," Shallan said. She would need to talk to the caravan master about shoes and clothing for her servants. As she walked off to see if she could use an extra chull of Macob's, she passed a group of the caravan workers waiting to the side of one of the bonfires. The deserters threw the last bodyone of their owninto the flames, then stepped back, wiping brows. One of the darkeyed caravan women stepped up, holding out a sheet of paper to a former deserter. He took it, scratching at his beard. He was the shorter, oneeyed man who'd spoken during her speech. He held up the sheet to the others. It was a prayer made from familiar runes, but not one of mourning, as Shallan would have expected to see. It was a prayer of thanks. The former deserters gathered in front of the flames and looked at the prayer. Then they turned and looked outward, seeingas if for the first timethe two dozen people standing there and watching. Silent in the night. Some had tears on their cheeks; some held the hands of children. Shallan had not noticed the children before, but was not surprised to see them. Caravan workers would spend their lives traveling, and their families would travel with them. Shallan stopped just beyond the caravaneers, mostly hidden in the darkness. The deserters didn't seem to know how to react, surrounded by that constellation of thankful eyes and tearful appreciation. Finally, they burned the prayer. Shallan bowed her head as they did, as did most of those watching. She left them standing taller, watching the ashes of that prayer rise toward the Almighty. Stormform is said to cause A tempest of winds and showers, Beware its powers, beware its powers. Though its coming brings the gods their night, It obliges a bloodred spren. Beware its end, beware its end. From the Listener Song of Winds, 4th stanza Kaladin watched the window shutters. Motion came in bursts. First stillness. Yes, he could hear a distant howling, the wind passing through some hollow, but nothing nearby. A tremble. Then wood rattling wickedly in its frame. Violent shaking, with water seeping in at the joints. Something was out there, in the dark chaos of the highstorm. It thrashed and pounded at the window, wanting in. Light flashed out there, glistening through the drops of water. Another flash. Then the light stayed. Steady, like glowing spheres, just outside. Faintly red. For some reason he couldn't explain, Kaladin had the impression of eyes. Transfixed, he raised his hand toward the latch, to open it and see. "Someone really needs to fix that loose shutter," King Elhokar said, annoyed. The light faded. The rattling stopped. Kaladin blinked, lowering his hand. "Someone remind me to ask Nakal to see to it," Elhokar said, pacing behind his couch. "The shutter shouldn't leak. This is my palace, not a village tavern!" "We'll make sure it's seen to," Adolin said. He sat in a chair beside the hearth, flipping through a book filled with sketches. His brother sat in a chair next to him, hands clasped in his lap. He was probably sore from his training, but he didn't show it. Instead, he had gotten a small box out of his pocket and was repeatedly opening it, turning it in his hand, rubbing one side, then shutting it with a click. He did it over and over and over. He stared at nothing as he did it. He seemed to do that a lot. Elhokar continued pacing. Idrinhead of the King's Guardstood near the king, straightbacked, green eyes forward. He was darkskinned for an Alethi, perhaps with some Azish blood in him, and wore a full beard. Men from Bridge Four had been taking shifts with his men, as Dalinar suggested, and so far Kaladin had been impressed by the man and the team he had run. However, when the horns for a plateau run sounded, Idrin would turn toward them and his expression would grow longing. He wanted to be out there fighting. Sadeas's betrayal had made a lot of the soldiers in camp similarly eager as if they wanted the chance to prove how strong Dalinar's army was. More rumbling came from the storm outside. It was odd not to be cold during a highstormthe barrack always felt chilly. This room was well heated, though not by a fire. Instead, the hearth held a ruby the size of Kaladin's fist, one that could have paid to feed everyone in his hometown for weeks. Kaladin left the window and sauntered toward the fireplace under the pretext of inspecting the gemstone. He really wanted a glimpse of whatever it was Adolin was looking through. Many men refused to even look at books, considering it unmasculine. Adolin didn't seem to be bothered by that. Curious. As he approached the hearth, Kaladin passed the door to a side room where Dalinar and Navani had retired at the advent of the storm. Kaladin had wanted to post a guard inside. They'd refused. Well, this is the only way into that room, he thought. There's not even a window. This time, if words appeared on the wall, he would know for certain nobody was sneaking in. Kaladin stooped down, inspecting the ruby in the hearth, which was held in place by a wire enclosure. Its strong heat made his face prickle with sweat; storms, that ruby was so large that the Light infusing it should have blinded him. Instead, he could stare into its depths and see the Light moving inside. People thought that the illumination from gemstones was steady and calm, but that was just in contrast to flickering candlelight. If you looked deeply into a stone, you could see the Light shifting with the chaotic pattern of a blowing storm. It was not calm inside. Not by a wind or a whisper. "Never seen a heating fabrial before, I assume?" Renarin asked. Kaladin glanced at the bespectacled prince. He wore an Alethi highlord's uniform, like that of Adolin. In fact, Kaladin had never seen them wearing anything elseother than Shardplate, of course. "No, I haven't," Kaladin said. "New technology," Renarin said, still playing with his little metal box. "My aunt built that one herself. Every time I turn around, it seems the world has changed somehow." Kaladin grunted. I know how that feels. Part of him yearned to suck in the Light of that gemstone. A foolish move. There'd be enough in there to make him glow like a bonfire. He lowered his hands and strolled past Adolin's chair. The sketches in Adolin's book were of men in fine clothing. The drawings were quite good, their faces done in as much detail as their garments. "Fashion?" Kaladin asked. He hadn't intended to speak, but it came out anyway. "You're spending the highstorm looking for new clothing?" Adolin snapped the book closed. "But you only wear uniforms," Kaladin said, confused. "Do you need to be here, bridgeboy?" Adolin demanded. "Surely nobody is going to come for us during a highstorm, of all things." "The fact that you assume that," Kaladin said, "is why I need to be here. What better time would there be for an assassination attempt? The winds would cover shouts, and help would be slow in coming when everyone has taken cover to wait out the storm. Seems to me this is one of the times when His Majesty most needs guards." The king stopped pacing and pointed. "That makes sense. Why hasn't anyone else ever explained that to me?" He looked at Idrin, who remained stoic. Adolin sighed. "You could at least leave Renarin and me out of it," he said softly to Kaladin. "It's easier to protect you when you're all together, Brightlord," Kaladin said, walking away. "Plus, you can defend each other." Dalinar had been intending to stay with Navani during the storm anyway. Kaladin approached the window again, listening to the storm pass outside. Had he really seen the things he thought he had during his time out in the storm? A face as vast as the sky? The Stormfather himself? I am a god, Syl had said. A little piece of one. Eventually, the storm passed, and Kaladin opened the window to a black sky, a few phantom clouds shining with Nomon's light. The storm had started a few hours into the night, but nobody could sleep during a storm. He hated when a highstorm came so late; he often felt exhausted the next day. The side room door opened and Dalinar stepped out, trailed by Navani. The statuesque woman carried a large notebook. Kaladin had heard, of course, about the highprince's fits during storms. His men were divided on the topic. Some thought Dalinar was frightened of highstorms, and his terror sent him into convulsions. Others whispered that with age, the Blackthorn was losing his mind. Kaladin badly wanted to know which it was. His fate, and that of his men, was tied to this man's health. "Numbers, sir?" Kaladin asked, peeking into the room, looking at the walls. "No," Dalinar said. "Sometimes they come just after the storm," Kaladin said. "I have men in the hall outside. I would prefer if everyone remained here for a short time." Dalinar nodded. "As you wish, soldier." Kaladin walked to the exit. Beyond, some men of Bridge Four and of the King's Guard stood on watch. Kaladin nodded to Leyten, then pointed for them to watch out on the balcony. Kaladin would catch the phantom scratching those numbers. If, indeed, such a person existed. Behind, Renarin and Adolin approached their father. "Anything new?" Renarin asked softly. "No," Dalinar said. "The vision was a repeat. But they're not coming in the same order as last time, and some are new, so perhaps there is something to learn we have not yet discovered . . ." Noticing Kaladin, he trailed off, then changed the topic. "Well, as long as we're waiting here, perhaps I can get an update. Adolin, when can we expect more duels?" "I'm trying," Adolin said with a grimace. "I thought beating Salinor would drive others to want to try me, but they're stalling instead." "Problematic," Navani said. "Weren't you always saying that everyone wanted to duel you?" "They did!" Adolin said. "When I couldn't duel, at least. Now, every time I make an offer, people start shuffling their feet and looking away." "Have you tried anyone in Sadeas's camp?" the king asked eagerly. "No," Adolin said. "But he's only got one Shardbearer other than himself. Amaram." Kaladin felt a shiver. "Well, you won't be dueling him," Dalinar said, chuckling. He sat down on the couch, Brightness Navani settling in beside him, hand fondly on his knee. "We might have him on our side. I've been speaking to Highlord Amaram . . ." "You think you can get him to secede?" the king asked. "Is that possible?" Kaladin asked, surprised. The lighteyes turned to him. Navani blinked, as if noticing him for the first time. "Yes, it is possible," Dalinar said. "Most of the territory that Amaram oversees would remain with Sadeas, but he could bring his personal land to my princedom along with his Shards. Usually it requires a land trade with a princedom bordering the one a highlord wishes to join." "It hasn't happened in over a decade," Adolin said, shaking his head. "I'm working on him," Dalinar said. "But Amaram . . . he wants to bring Sadeas and me together instead. He thinks we can get along again." Adolin snorted. "That possibility blew away the day Sadeas betrayed us." "Probably long before that day," Dalinar said, "even if I didn't see it. Is there anyone else you could challenge, Adolin?" "I'm going to try Talanor," Adolin said, "and then Kalishor." "Neither full Shardbearers," Navani said with a frown. "The first has only the Blade, the second only the Plate." "All of the full Shardbearers have refused me," Adolin said with a shrug. "Those two are eager, thirsty for notoriety. One of them might agree where others haven't." Kaladin folded his arms, leaning back against the wall. "And if you defeat them, won't it scare off others from fighting you?" "When I beat them," Adolin said, glancing at Kaladin's relaxed posture and frowning, "Father will maneuver others into agreeing to duels." "But it will have to stop sometime, right?" Kaladin asked. "Eventually the other highprinces will realize what's happening. They'll refuse to be goaded into further duels. It might be happening already. That's why they don't accept." "Someone will," Adolin said, standing. "And once I start winning, others will begin to see me as a real challenge. They'll want to test themselves." That seemed optimistic to Kaladin. "Captain Kaladin is right," Dalinar said. Adolin turned toward his father. "There's no need to fight every Shardbearer in camp," Dalinar said softly. "We need to narrow our attack, choose duels for you that point us toward the ultimate goal." "Which is?" Adolin asked. "Undermining Sadeas." Dalinar almost sounded regretful. "Killing him in a duel, if we have to. Everyone in camp knows the sides in this power struggle. This won't work if we punish everyone equally. We need to show those in the middle, those deciding whom to follow, the advantages of trust. Cooperation on plateau runs. Help from one another's Shardbearers. We show them what it's like to be part of a real kingdom." The others grew quiet. The king turned away with a shake of his head. He didn't believe, at least not fully, in what Dalinar wished to achieve. Kaladin found himself annoyed. Why should he be? Dalinar had agreed with him. He stewed for a moment, and realized that he was probably still upset because someone had mentioned Amaram. Even hearing the man's name put Kaladin out of sorts. He kept thinking something should happen, something should change, now that such a murderer was in camp. Yet everything just kept on going. It was frustrating. Made him want to lash out. He needed to do something about it. "I assume we've waited long enough?" Adolin said to his father. "I can go?" Dalinar sighed, nodding. Adolin pulled open the door and strode away; Renarin followed at a slower pace, hauling that Shardblade he was still bonding, sheathed in its protective strips. As they passed the group of guards Kaladin had put outside, Skar and three others broke off to follow them. Kaladin walked to the door, doing a quick count of who was left. Four men total. "Moash," Kaladin said, noticing the man yawning. "How long have you been on duty today?" Moash shrugged. "One shift guarding Brightness Navani. One shift with the King's Guard." I'm working them too hard, Kaladin thought. Stormfather. I don't have enough men. Even with the leftover Cobalt Guard that Dalinar is sending to me. "Head back and get some sleep," Kaladin said. "You too, Bisig. I saw you on shift this morning." "And you?" Moash asked Kaladin. "I'm fine." He had Stormlight to keep him alert. True, using Stormlight that way could be dangerousit provoked him to act, to be more impulsive. He wasn't sure he liked what it did to him when he used it outside of battle. Moash raised an eyebrow. "You've got to be at least as tired as I am, Kal." "I'll go back in a bit," Kaladin said. "You need some time off, Moash. You'll get sloppy if you don't take it." "I have to pull two shifts," Moash said, shrugging. "At least, if you want me to train with the King's Guard as well as doing my regular guard duty." Kaladin drew his lips to a line. That was important. Moash needed to think like a bodyguard, and there was no better way than serving on an alreadyestablished crew. "My shift here with the King's Guard is almost over," Moash noted. "I'll head back after." "Fine," Kaladin said. "Keep Leyten with you. Natam, you and Mart guard Brightness Navani. I'll see Dalinar back to camp and post guards at his door." "Then you'll get some sleep?" Moash asked. The others glanced at Kaladin. They were worried as well. "Yes, fine." Kaladin turned back to the room, where Dalinar was helping Navani to her feet. He'd walk her to her door, as he did most evenings. Kaladin debated for a moment, then stepped up to the highprince. "Sir, there's something I need to talk to you about." "Can it wait until I'm done here?" Dalinar said. "Yes, sir," Kaladin said. "I'll wait at the palace's front doors, then will be your guard on the way back to camp." Dalinar led Navani away, joined by two bridgeman guards. Kaladin made his own way down the corridor, thinking. Servants had already come by to open the corridor windows, and Syl floated in through one as a spinning swirl of mist. Giggling, she spun around him a few times before going out another window. She always got more sprenlike during a highstorm. The air smelled wet and fresh. The whole world felt clean after a highstorm, scrubbed by nature's abrasive. He reached the front of the palace, where a pair of the King's Guard stood on watch. Kaladin nodded to them and got crisp salutes in return, then he fetched a sphere lantern from the guard post and filled it with his own spheres. From the front of the palace, Kaladin could look out over all ten warcamps. As always after a storm, the Light of refreshed spheres sparkled everywhere, their gemstones ablaze with captured fragments of the tempest that had passed. Standing there, Kaladin confronted what he needed to say to Dalinar. He rehearsed it silently more than once, but still wasn't ready when the highprince emerged at last from the palace doors. Natam saluted from behind them, handing Dalinar off to Kaladin, then jogged back to join Mart outside Brightness Navani's door. The highprince started down the switchbacks of the side route down from the Pinnacle to the stables below. Kaladin fell in beside him. Dalinar appeared deeply distracted by something. He hasn't ever announced anything about his fits during highstorms, Kaladin thought. Shouldn't he say something? They'd talked about visions, earlier. What was it Dalinar saw, or thought he saw? "So, soldier," Dalinar said as they walked. "What is it you wanted to discuss?" Kaladin took a deep breath. "A year ago, I was a soldier in Amaram's army." "So that's where you learned," Dalinar said. "I should have guessed. Amaram is the only general in Sadeas's princedom with any real leadership ability." "Sir," Kaladin said, stopping on the steps. "He betrayed me and my men." Dalinar stopped and turned to look at him. "A poor battle decision, then? Nobody is perfect, soldier. If he sent your men into a bad situation, I doubt he intended to do so." Just push through it, Kaladin told himself, noticing Syl sitting on a shalebark ridge just to the right. She nodded at him. He has to know. It was just . . . He'd never spoken of this, not in full. Not even to Rock, Teft, and the others. "It wasn't that, sir," Kaladin said, meeting Dalinar's eyes by spherelight. "I know where Amaram got his Shardblade. I was there. I killed the Shardbearer carrying it." "That can't be the case," Dalinar said slowly. "If you had, you'd hold the Plate and Blade." "Amaram took it for himself, then slaughtered everyone who knew the truth," Kaladin said. "Everyone but a lone soldier who, in his guilt, Amaram branded a slave and sold rather than murdering." Dalinar stood in silence. From this angle, the hillside behind him was completely dark, lit only by stars. A few spheres glowed in Dalinar's pocket, shining through the fabric of his uniform. "Amaram is one of the best men I know," Dalinar said. "His honor is spotless. I've never even known him to take undue advantage of an opponent in a duel, despite cases when it would have been acceptable." Kaladin didn't respond. He'd believed that too, at one point. "Do you have any proof?" Dalinar asked. "You understand that I can't take one man's word on something of this nature." "One darkeyed man's word, you mean," Kaladin said, gritting his teeth. "It's not the color of your eyes that is the problem," Dalinar said, "but the severity of your accusation. The words you speak are dangerous. Do you have any proof, soldier?" "There were others there when he took the Shards. Men of his personal guard did the actual killing at his command. And there was a stormwarden there. Middleaged, with a peaked face. He wore a beard like an ardent." He paused. "They were all complicit in the act, but maybe . . ." Dalinar sighed softly in the night. "Have you spoken this accusation to anyone else?" "No," Kaladin said. "Continue to hold your tongue. I'll talk to Amaram. Thank you for telling me of this." "Sir," Kaladin said, taking a step closer to Dalinar. "If you really believe in justice, you" "That's enough for the moment, son," Dalinar cut in, voice calm but cool. "You've had your say, unless you can offer me anything else by way of evidence." Kaladin forced down his immediate burst of anger. It was difficult. "I appreciated your input when we were talking about my son's duels earlier," Dalinar said. "This is the second time you've added something important to one of our conferences, I believe." "Thank you, sir." "But soldier," Dalinar said, "you're walking quite a line between helpfulness and insubordination in the way you treat me and mine. You have a chip on your shoulder the size of a boulder. I ignore it, because I know what was done to you, and I can see the soldier beneath. That's the man I hired for this job." Kaladin ground his teeth, and nodded. "Yes, sir." "Good. Now run along." "Sir, but I must escort" "I think I'll return to the palace," Dalinar said. "I don't think I'll get much sleep tonight, so I might want to pester the dowager with my thoughts. Her guards can watch over me. I'll take one with me when I return to my camp." Kaladin let out a long breath. Then saluted. Fine, he thought, continuing down the dark, damp path. When he reached the bottom, Dalinar was still standing up above, now just a shadow. He seemed lost in thought. Kaladin turned and walked back toward Dalinar's warcamp. Syl flitted up and landed on his shoulder. "See," she said. "He listened." "No he didn't, Syl." "What? He replied and said" "I told him something he didn't want to hear," Kaladin said. "Even if he does look into it, he'll find plenty of reasons to dismiss what I said. In the end, it will be my word against Amaram's. Stormfather! I shouldn't have said anything." "You'd let it go, then?" "Storms, no," Kaladin said. "I'd find my own justice." "Oh . . ." Syl settled on his shoulder. They walked for a long while, eventually approaching the warcamp. "You're not a Skybreaker, Kaladin," Syl finally said. "You're not supposed to be like this." "A what?" he asked, stepping over scuttling cremlings in the dark. They came out in force after a storm, when plants unfolded to lap up the water. "That was one of the orders, wasn't it?" He did know some little of them. Everyone did, from the legends. "Yes," Syl said, voice soft. "I'm worried about you, Kaladin. I thought things would be better, once you were free from the bridges." "Things are better," he said. "None of my men have been killed since we were freed." "But you . . ." She didn't seem to know what else to say. "I thought you might be like the person you were before. I can remember a man on a field of battle . . . A man who fought . . ." "That man is dead, Syl," Kaladin said, waving to the guards as he entered the warcamp. Once again, light and motion surrounded him, people running quick errands, parshmen repairing buildings damaged by the storm. "During my time as a bridgeman, all I had to worry about was my men. Now things are different. I have to become someone. I just don't know who yet." When he reached Bridge Four's barrack, Rock was dishing out the evening stew. Far later than usual, but some of the men were on odd shifts. The men weren't limited to stew any longer, but they still insisted on it for the evening meal. Kaladin took a bowl gratefully, nodding to Bisig, who was relaxing with several of the others and chatting about how they actually missed carrying their bridge. Kaladin had instilled in them a respect for it, much as a soldier respected his spear. Stew. Bridges. They spoke so fondly of things that had once been emblems of their captivity. Kaladin took a bite, then stopped, noticing a new man leaning against a rock beside the fire. "Do I know you?" he asked, pointing at the bald, muscular man. He had tan skin, like an Alethi, but he didn't seem to have the right face shape. Herdazian? "Oh, don't mind Punio," Lopen called from nearby. "He's my cousin." "You had a cousin on the bridge crews?" Kaladin asked. "Nah," Lopen said. "He just heard my mother say we needed more guards, so he came to help. I got him a uniform and things." The newcomer, Punio, smiled and raised his spoon. "Bridge Four," he said with a thick Herdazian accent. "Are you a soldier?" Kaladin asked him. "Yes," the man said. "Brightlord Roion army. Not worry. I swore to Kholin instead, now. For my cousin." He smiled affably. "You can't just leave your army, Punio," Kaladin said, rubbing his forehead. "It's called desertion." "Not for us," Lopen called. "We're Herdaziannobody can tell us apart anyway." "Yes," Punio said. "I leave for the homeland once a year. When I come back, nobody remembers me." He shrugged. "This time, I come here." Kaladin sighed, but the man looked like he knew his way around a spear, and Kaladin did need more men. "Fine. Just pretend you were one of the bridgemen from the start, all right?" "Bridge Four!" the man said enthusiastically. Kaladin passed him and found his customary place by the fire to relax and think. He didn't get that chance, however, as someone stepped up and squatted down before him. A man with marbled skin and a Bridge Four uniform. "Shen?" Kaladin asked. "Sir." Shen continued to stare at him. "Is there something you wanted?" Kaladin asked. "Am I really Bridge Four?" Shen asked. "Of course you are." "Where is my spear?" Kaladin looked Shen in the eyes. "What do you think?" "I think that I am not Bridge Four," Shen said, taking time to think with each word. "I am Bridge Four's slave." It was like a punch to Kaladin's gut. He'd hardly heard a dozen words out of the man during their time together, and now this? The words smarted either way. Here was a man who, unlike the others, wasn't welcome to leave and make his way in the world. Dalinar had freed the rest of Bridge Fourbut a parshman . . . he'd be a slave no matter where he went or what he did. What could Kaladin say? Storms. "I appreciate your help when we were scavenging. I know it was difficult for you to see what we did down there sometimes." Shen waited, still squatting, listening. He regarded Kaladin with those impenetrable, solid black parshman eyes of his. "I can't start arming parshmen, Shen," Kaladin said. "The lighteyes barely accept us as it is. If I gave you a spear, think of the storm it would cause." Shen nodded, face displaying no hint of his emotions. He stood up straight. "A slave I am, then." He withdrew. Kaladin knocked his head back against the stone behind him, staring up at the sky. Storming man. He had a good life, for a parshman. Certainly more freedom than any other of his kind. And were you satisfied with that? a voice inside him asked. Were you happy to be a welltreated slave? Or did you try to run, fight your way to freedom? What a mess. He mulled over those thoughts, digging into his stew. He got two bites down before Natamone of the men who'd been guarding at the palacecame stumbling into their camp, sweating, frantic, and redcheeked from running. "The king!" Natam said, puffing. "An assassin." Nightform predicting what will be, The form of shadows, mind to foresee. As the gods did leave, the nightform whispered. A new storm will come, someday to break. A new storm a new world to make. A new storm a new path to take, the nightform listens. From the Listener Song of Secrets, 17th stanza The king was fine. One hand on the doorframe, Kaladin stood gasping from his run back to the palace. Inside, Elhokar, Dalinar, Navani, and both of Dalinar's sons spoke together. Nobody was dead. Nobody was dead. Stormfather, he thought, stepping into the room. For a moment, I felt like I did on the plateaus, watching my men charge the Parshendi. He hardly knew these people, but they were his duty. He hadn't thought that his protectiveness could apply to lighteyes. "Well, at least he ran here," the king said, waving off the attentions of a woman who was trying to bandage a gash on his forehead. "You see, Idrin. This is what a good bodyguard looks like. I bet he wouldn't have let this happen." The captain of the King's Guard stood near the door, redfaced. He looked away, then stalked out into the hallway. Kaladin raised a hand to his head, bewildered. Comments like that one from the king were not going to help his men get along with Dalinar's soldiers. Inside the room, a mess of guards, servants, and members of Bridge Four stood around, looking confused or embarrassed. Natam was therehe'd been on duty with the King's Guardas was Moash. "Moash," Kaladin called. "You're supposed to be back in the camp asleep." "So are you," Moash said. Kaladin grunted, trotting over, speaking more softly. "Were you here when it happened?" "I'd just left," Moash said. "Finishing my shift with the King's Guard. I heard yelling, and came back as quickly as I could." He nodded toward the open balcony door. "Come have a look." They walked out onto the balcony, which was a circular stone pathway that ran around the peak rooms of the palacea terrace cut into the stone itself. From such a height, the balcony offered an unparalleled view overlooking the warcamps and the Plains beyond. Some members of the King's Guard stood here, inspecting the balcony railing with sphere lamps. A section of the ironwork structure had twisted outward and hung precariously over the drop. "From what we've figured," Moash said, pointing, "the king came out here to think, as he likes to do." Kaladin nodded, walking with Moash. The stone floor beneath was still wet from highstorm rain. They reached the place where the railing was ripped, several guards making way for them. Kaladin looked down over the side. The drop was a good hundred feet onto the rocks below. Syl drifted through the air down there, making lazy glowing circles. "Damnation, Kaladin!" Moash said, taking his arm. "Are you trying to make me panic?" I wonder if I could survive that fall. . . . He'd dropped half that once before, filled with Stormlight, and had landed without trouble. He stepped back for Moash's sake, though even before gaining his special abilities, heights had fascinated him. It felt liberating to be up so high. Just you and the air itself. He knelt down, looking at the places where the footings of the iron railing had been mortared into holes in the stone. "The railing pulled free of its mountings?" he asked, poking his finger into a hole, then pulling it out with mortar dust on his fingers. "Yeah," Moash said, several of the men of the king's guard nodding. "Could just be a flaw in the design," Kaladin said. "Captain," said one of the guardsmen. "I was here when it happened, watching him on the balcony. It fell right out. Barely a sound. I was standing here, looking out at the Plains and thinking to myself, and next I knew His Majesty was hanging right there, holding on for his life and cursing like a caravan worker." The guard blushed. "Sir." Kaladin stood, inspecting the metalwork. So the king had leaned against this section of the railing, and it had bent forwardthe mountings at the bottom giving way. It had almost come free completely, but fortunately one bar had held tight. The king had grabbed hold and clung to it long enough to be rescued. This should never have been possible. The thing looked as if it had been constructed of wood and rope first, then Soulcast into iron. Shaking another section, he found it incredibly secure. Even a few footings giving out shouldn't have let the whole thing fall offthe metal pieces would have had to come apart. He moved to the right, inspecting some of those that had ripped free of one another. The two pieces of metal had been sheared at a joint. Smoothly, cleanly. The doorway into the king's chamber darkened as Dalinar Kholin stepped out onto the balcony. "In," he said to Moash and the other guards. "Close the door. I'd like to speak to Captain Kaladin." They obeyed, though Moash went reluctantly. Dalinar walked up to Kaladin as the windows closed, giving them privacy. Despite his age, the highprince's figure was an intimidating one, wide shouldered, built like a brick wall. "Sir," Kaladin said. "I should have" "This wasn't your fault," Dalinar said. "The king wasn't under your care. Even if he was, I wouldn't reprimand youjust as I won't reprimand Idrin. I wouldn't expect bodyguards to inspect architecture." "Yes, sir," Kaladin said. Dalinar knelt down to inspect the mountings. "You like to take responsibility for things, don't you? A commendable attribute in an officer." Dalinar rose and looked at the place where the rail had been cut. "What is your assessment?" "Someone definitely chipped at the mortar," Kaladin said, "and sabotaged the railing." Dalinar nodded. "I agree. This was a deliberate attempt on the king's life." "However . . . sir . . ." "Yes?" "Whoever tried this is an idiot." Dalinar looked to him, raising an eyebrow in the lantern light. "How could they know where the king would lean?" Kaladin said. "Or even that he would? This trap could easily have caught someone else, and then the wouldbe assassins would have exposed themselves for nothing. In fact, that is what happened. The king survived, and now we're aware of them." "We've been expecting assassins," Dalinar said. "And not just because of the incident with the king's armor. Half the powerful men in this camp are probably contemplating some kind of assassination attempt, so an attempt on Elhokar's life doesn't tell us as much as you'd think. As to how they knew to catch him here, he has a favorite spot for standing, leaning against the rail and looking out over the Shattered Plains. Anyone who watches his patterns would have known where to apply their sabotage." "But sir," Kaladin said, "it's just so convoluted. If they have access to the king's private chambers, then why not hide an assassin inside? Or use poison?" "Poison is as unlikely to work as this was," Dalinar said, waving toward the railing. "The king's food and drink is tasted. As for a hidden assassin, one might run into guards." He stood up. "But I agree that such methods would probably have had a greater chance at success. The fact that they didn't try it that way tells us something. Assuming these are the same people who planted those flawed gemstones in the king's armor, they prefer nonconfrontational methods. It's not that they're idiots, they're . . ." "They're cowards," Kaladin realized. "They want to make the assassination look like an accident. They're timid. They may have waited this long so that suspicion would die down." "Yes," Dalinar said, rising, looking troubled. "This time, though, they made a big mistake." "How?" Kaladin walked to the cut section he had inspected earlier and knelt down to rub the smooth section. "What cuts iron so cleanly?" Dalinar leaned down, inspecting the cut, then took out a sphere for more light. He grunted. "It's supposed to look like the joint came apart, I'd guess." "And does it?" Kaladin asked. "No. That was a Shardblade." "Narrows down our suspects a tad, I'd think." Dalinar nodded. "Don't tell anyone else. We'll hide that we noticed the Shardblade cut, maybe gain an edge. It's too late to pretend that we think this was an accident, but we don't have to reveal everything." "Yes, sir." "The king is insisting that I put you in charge of guarding him," Dalinar said. "We might have to move up our timetable for that." "I'm not ready," Kaladin said. "My men are stretched thin with the duties they already have." "I know," Dalinar said softly. He seemed hesitant. "This was done by someone on the inside, you realize." Kaladin felt cold. "The king's own chambers? That means a servant. Or one of his guards. Men in the King's Guard might have had access to his armor, too." Dalinar looked at Kaladin, face lit by the sphere in his hand. A strong face, with a nose that had once been broken. Blunt. Real. "I don't know whom I can trust these days. Can I trust you, Kaladin Stormblessed?" "Yes. I swear it." Dalinar nodded. "I'm going to relieve Idrin of this post and assign him to a command in my army. It will sate the king, but I'll make certain Idrin knows he isn't being punished. I suspect he'll enjoy the new command more anyway." "Yes, sir." "I'll ask him for his best men," Dalinar said, "and those will be under your command for now. Use them as little as possible. I eventually want the king being guarded only by men from the bridge crewsmen you trust, men who have no part in warcamp politics. Choose carefully. I don't want to replace potential traitors with former thieves who can be easily bought." "Yes, sir," Kaladin said, feeling a large weight settle on his shoulders. Dalinar stood up. "I don't know what else to do. A man needs to be able to trust his own guards." He walked back toward the door into the room. The tone of his voice sounded deeply troubled. "Sir?" Kaladin asked. "This wasn't the assassination attempt you were expecting, was it?" "No," Dalinar said, hand on the doorknob. "I agree with your assessment. This wasn't the work of someone who knows what they're doing. Considering how contrived it was, I'm actually surprised at how close it came to working." He leveled his gaze at Kaladin. "If Sadeas decides to strikeor, worse, the assassin who claimed my brother's lifeit will not go so well for us. The storm is yet to come." He pulled open the door, letting out the complaints of the king, which had been muffled behind it. Elhokar was ranting that nobody took his safety seriously, that nobody listened, that they should be looking for the things he saw over his shoulder in the mirror, whatever that meant. The tirade sounded like the whining of a spoiled child. Kaladin looked at the twisted rail, imagining the king dangling from it. He had good reason to be out of sorts. But then, wasn't a king supposed to be better than that? Didn't his Calling demand that he be able to keep his composure under pressure? Kaladin found it difficult to imagine Dalinar reacting with such ranting, regardless of the situation. Your job isn't to judge, he told himself, waving to Syl and walking away from the balcony. Your job is to protect these people. Somehow. Decayform destroys the souls of dreams. A form of gods to avoid, it seems. Seek not its touch, nor beckon its screams, deny it. Watch where you walk, your toes to tread, O'er hill or rocky riverbed Hold dear the fears that fill your head, defy it. From the Listener Song of Secrets, 27th stanza "Well, you see," Gaz said as he sanded the wood on Shallan's wagon. She sat nearby, listening as she worked. "Most of us, we joined the fight at the Shattered Plains for revenge, you know? Those marbles killed the king. It was gonna be this grand thing and such. A fight for vengeance, a way to show the world that the Alethi don't stand for betrayal." "Yeah," Red agreed. The lanky, bearded soldier pulled free a bar from her wagon. With this one removed, it left only three at each corner to hold up the roof. He dropped the bar with satisfaction, then dusted off his work gloves. This would help transform the vehicle from a rolling cage into a conveyance more suitable for a lighteyed lady. "I remember it," Red continued, sitting down on the wagon's bed, legs dangling. "The call to arms came to us from Highprince Vamah himself, and it moved through Farcoast like a bad stench. Every second man of age joined the cause. People wondered if you were a coward if you went to the pub for a drink but didn't wear a recruit's patch. I joined up with five of my buddies. They're all dead now, rotting in those stormcursed chasms." "So you just . . . got tired of fighting?" Shallan asked. She had a desk now. Well, a tablea small piece of travel furniture that could be taken apart easily. They'd moved it out of the wagon, and she was using it to review some of Jasnah's notes. The caravan was making camp as the day waned; they'd traveled well today, but Shallan wasn't pushing them hard, after what they'd all been through. After four days of travel, they were approaching the section of the corridor where bandit strikes were much less likely. They were getting close to the Shattered Plains, and the safety they offered. "Tired of fighting?" Gaz said, chuckling as he took a hinge and began nailing it in place. Occasionally, he would glance to the side, a kind of nervous tic. "Damnation, no. It wasn't us, it was the storming lighteyes! No offense intended, Brightness. But storm them, and storm them good!" "They stopped fighting to win," Red softly added. "And they started fighting for spheres." "Every day," Gaz said. "Every storming day, we'd get up and fight on those plateaus. And we wouldn't make any progress. Who cared if we made progress? It was the gemhearts the highprinces were after. And there we were, locked into virtual slavery by our military oaths. No right of travel as good citizens should have, since we'd enlisted. We were dying, bleeding, and suffering so they could get rich! That was all. So we left. A bunch of us who drank together, though we served different highprinces. We left them and their war behind." "Now, Gaz," Red said. "That isn't everything. Be honest with the lady. Didn't you owe some spheres to the debtmongers too? What was that you told us about being one step from being turned into a bridgeman" "Here now," Gaz said. "That's my old life. Ain't nothing in that old life that matters anymore." He finished with the hammer. "Besides. Brightness Shallan said our debts would be taken care of." "Everything will be forgiven," Shallan said. "See?" "Except your breath," she added. Gaz looked up, a blush rising on his scarred face, but Red just laughed. After a moment, Gaz gave in to chuckling. There was something desperately affable about these soldiers. They had seized the chance to live a normal life again and were determined to hold to it. There hadn't been a single problem with discipline in the days they'd been together, and they were quick, even eager, to be of service to her. Evidence of that came as Gaz folded the side of her wagon back upthen opened a latch and lowered a small window to let the light in. He gestured with a smile at his new window. "Maybe not nice enough to befit a lighteyed lady, but at least you'll be able to see out now." "Not bad," Red said, clapping slowly. "Why didn't you tell us you'd trained as a carpenter?" "I haven't trained as one," Gaz said, expression turning oddly solemn. "I spent some time around a lumberyard, that's all. You pick up a few things." "It's very nice, Gaz," Shallan said. "I appreciate it deeply." "It's nothing. You should probably have one on the other side too. I'll see if I can scrounge another hinge off the merchants." "Already kissing the feet of our new master, Gaz?" Vathah stepped up to the group. Shallan hadn't noticed him approaching. The leader of the former deserters held a small bowl of steaming curry from the dinner cauldron. Shallan could smell the pungent peppers. While it would have made a nice change from the stew she'd eaten with the slavers, the caravan had proper women's food, which she was obliged to eat. Maybe she could sneak a bite of the curry when nobody was looking. "You didn't ever offer to make things like this for me, Gaz," Vathah said, dipping his bread and tearing off a chunk with his teeth. He spoke while chewing. "You seem happy to have been made a servant to the lighteyes again. It's a wonder your shirt isn't torn up from all the crawling and scraping you've been doing." Gaz blushed again. "So far as I know, Vathah," Shallan said, "you didn't have a wagon. So what is it you'd have wanted Gaz to make a window in? Your head, perhaps? I'm certain we can arrange that." Vathah smiled as he ate, though it wasn't a particularly pleasant smile. "Did he tell you about the money he owes?" "We will handle that problem when the time comes." "This lot is going to be more trouble than you think, little lighteyes," Vathah said, shaking his head as he dipped his bread again. "Going right back to where they were before." "This time they'll be heroes for rescuing me." He snorted. "This lot will never be heroes. They're crem, Brightness. Pure and simple." Nearby Gaz looked down and Red turned away, but neither disagreed with the assessment. "You're trying very hard to beat them down, Vathah," Shallan said, standing. "Are you that afraid of being wrong? One would assume you'd be accustomed to it by now." He grunted. "Be careful, girl. You wouldn't want to accidentally insult a man." "The last thing I'd want to do is accidentally insult you, Vathah," Shallan said. "To think that I couldn't manage it on purpose if I wanted!" He looked at her, then flushed and took a moment, trying to come up with a response. Shallan cut in before he could do so. "I'm not surprised you're at a loss for words, as it's also an experience I'm sure you're accustomed to. You must feel it every time someone asks you a challenging questionsuch as the color of your shirt." "Cute," he said. "But words aren't going to change these men or the troubles they are in." "On the contrary," Shallan said, meeting his eyes, "in my experience, words are where most change begins. I have promised them a second chance. I will keep my promise." Vathah grunted, but wandered away without further comment. Shallan sighed, sitting down and returning to her work. "That one always walks around acting like a chasmfiend ate his mother," she said with a grimace. "Or perhaps the chasmfiend was his mother." Red laughed. "If you don't mind me saying, Brightness. You have quite the clever tongue on you!" "I've never actually had someone's tongue on me," Shallan said, turning a page and not looking up, "clever or not. I'd hazard to consider it an unpleasant experience." "It ain't so bad," Gaz said. They both looked at him. He shrugged. "Just saying. It ain't . . ." Red laughed, slapping Gaz on the shoulder. "I'm going to get some food. I'll help you hunt down that hinge afterward." Gaz nodded, though he glanced to the side againthat same nervous ticand didn't join Red as the taller man walked toward the dinner cauldron. Instead, he settled down to begin sanding the floor of her wagon where the wood had begun to splinter. She set aside the notebook in front of her, in which she had been attempting to devise ways to help her brothers. Those included everything from trying to buy one of the Soulcasters owned by the Alethi king to trying to track down the Ghostbloods and somehow deflect their attention. She couldn't do anything, however, until she reached the Shattered Plainsand then, most of her plans would require her to have powerful allies. Shallan needed to make the betrothal to Adolin Kholin go forward. Not just for her family, but for the good of the world. Shallan would need the allies and resources that would give her. But what if she couldn't maintain the betrothal? What if she couldn't bring Brightness Navani to her side? She might need to proceed in finding Urithiru and preparing for the Voidbringers on her own. That terrified her, but she wanted to be ready. She dug out a different bookone of the few from Jasnah's stash that didn't describe the Voidbringers or legendary Urithiru. Instead, it listed the current Alethi highprinces and discussed their political maneuvers and goals. Shallan had to be ready. She had to know the political landscape of the Alethi court. She couldn't afford ignorance. She had to know who among these people might be potential allies, if all else failed her. What of this Sadeas? she thought, flipping to a page in the notebook. It listed him as conniving and dangerous, but noted that both he and his wife were sharp of wit. A man of intelligence might listen to Shallan's arguments and understand them. Aladar was listed as another highprince that Jasnah respected. Powerful, known for his brilliant political maneuvers. He was also fond of games of chance. Perhaps he would risk an expedition to find Urithiru, if Shallan highlighted the potential riches to be found. Hatham was listed as a man of delicate politics and careful planning. Another potential ally. Jasnah didn't think much of Thanadal, Bethab, or Sebarial. The first she called oily, the second a dullard, and the third outrageously rude. She studied them and their motivations for some time. Eventually, Gaz stood up and dusted sawdust from his trousers. He nodded in respect to her and moved to get himself some food. "A moment, Master Gaz," she said. "I'm no master," he said, walking up to her. "Sixth nahn only, Brightness. Never could buy myself anything better." "How bad, exactly, are these debts of yours?" she asked, digging some spheres out of her safepouch to put in the goblet on her desk. "Well, one of the fellows I owed was executed," Gaz said, rubbing his chin. "But there is more." He hesitated. "Eighty ruby broams, Brightness. Though they might not take them anymore. It's my head they may want, these days." "Quite a debt for a man such as yourself. Are you a gambler, then?" "Ain't no difference," he said. "Sure." "And that's a lie," Shallan said, cocking her head. "I would know the truth from you, Gaz." "Just turn me over to them," he said, turning and walking toward the soup. "Ain't no matter. I'd rather that than be out here, wondering when they'll find me, anyways." Shallan watched him go, then shook her head, turning back to her studies. She says that Urithiru is not on the Shattered Plains, Shallan thought, turning a few pages. But how is she certain? The Plains were never fully explored, because of the chasms. Who knows what is out there? Fortunately, Jasnah was very complete in her notes. It appeared that most of the old records spoke of Urithiru as being in the mountains. The Shattered Plains filled a basin. Nohadon could walk there, Shallan thought, flipping to a quote from The Way of Kings. Jasnah questioned the validity of that statement, though Jasnah questioned pretty much everything. After an hour of study as the sun sank down through the sky, Shallan found herself rubbing her temples. "Are you well?" Pattern's voice asked softly. He liked to come out when it was darker, and she did not forbid him. She searched and found him on the table, a complex formation of ridges in the wood. "Historians," Shallan said, "are a bunch of liars." "Mmmmm," Pattern said, sounding satisfied. "That wasn't a compliment." "Oh." Shallan slammed her current book closed. "These women were supposed to be scholars! Instead of recording facts, they wrote opinions and presented them as truth. They seem to take great pains to contradict one another, and they dance around topics of import like spren around a firenever providing heat themselves, just making a show of it." Pattern hummed. "Truth is individual." "What? No it's not. Truth is . . . it's Truth. Reality." "Your truth is what you see," Pattern said, sounding confused. "What else could it be? That is the truth that you spoke to me, the truth that brings power." She looked at him, his ridges casting shadows in the light of her spheres. She'd renewed those in the highstorm last night, while she was cooped up in her box of a wagon. Pattern had started buzzing in the middle of the storma strange, angry sound. After that, he'd ranted in a language she didn't understand, panicking Gaz and the other soldiers she'd invited into the shelter. Luckily, they took it for granted that terrible things happened during highstorms, and none had spoken of it since. Fool, she told herself, flipping to an empty page in the notes. Start acting like a scholar. Jasnah would be disappointed. She wrote down what Pattern had said just now. "Pattern," she said, tapping her pencilone she'd gotten from the merchants, along with paper. "This table has four legs. Would you not say that is a truth, independent of my perspective?" Pattern buzzed uncertainly. "What is a leg? Only as it is defined by you. Without a perspective, there is no such thing as a leg, or a table. There is only wood." "You've told me the table perceives itself this way." "Because people have considered it, long enough, as being a table," Pattern said. "It becomes truth to the table because of the truth the people create for it." Interesting, Shallan thought, scribbling away at her notebook. She wasn't so interested in the nature of truth at the moment, but in how Pattern perceived it. Is this because he's from the Cognitive Realm? The books say that the Spiritual Realm is a place of pure truth, while the Cognitive is more fluid. "Spren," Shallan said. "If people weren't here, would spren have thought?" "Not here, in this realm," Pattern said. "I do not know about the other realm." "You don't sound concerned," Shallan said. "Your entire existence might be dependent on people." "It is," Pattern said, again unconcerned. "But children are dependent upon parents." He hesitated. "Besides, there are others who think." "Voidbringers," Shallan said, cold. "Yes. I do not think that my kind would live in a world with only them. They have their own spren." Shallan sat up sharply. "Their own spren?" Pattern shrank on her table, scrunching up, his ridges growing less distinct as they mashed together. "Well?" Shallan asked. "We do not speak of this." "You might want to start," Shallan said. "It's important." Pattern buzzed. She thought he was going to insist on the point, but after a moment, he continued in a very small voice. "Spren are . . . power . . . shattered power. Power given thought by the perceptions of men. Honor, Cultivation, and . . . and another. Fragments broken off." "Another?" Shallan prodded. Pattern's buzz became a whine, going so high pitched she almost couldn't hear it. "Odium." He spoke the word as if needing to force it out. Shallan wrote furiously. Odium. Hatred. A type of spren? Perhaps a large unique one, like Cusicesh from Iri or the Nightwatcher. Hatredspren. She'd never heard of such a thing. As she wrote, one of her slaves approached in the darkening night. The timid man wore a simple tunic and trousers, one of the sets given to Shallan by the merchants. The gift was welcome, as the last of Shallan's spheres were in the goblet before her, and wouldn't be enough to buy a meal at some of the finer restaurants in Kharbranth. "Brightness?" the man asked. "Yes, Suna?" "I . . . um . . ." He pointed. "The other lady, she asked me to tell you . . ." He was pointing toward the tent used by Tyn, the tall woman who was leader of the few remaining caravan guards. "She wants me to visit her?" Shallan asked. "Yes," Suna said, looking down. "For food, I guess?" "Thank you, Suna," Shallan said, freeing him to go back toward the fire where he and the other slaves were helping with the cooking while parshmen gathered wood. Shallan's slaves were a quiet group. They had tattoos on their foreheads, rather than brands. It was the kinder way to do it, and usually marked a person who had entered servitude willingly, as opposed to being forced into it as a punishment for a violent or terrible crime. They were men with debts or the children of slaves who still bore the debt of their parents. These were accustomed to labor, and seemed frightened by the idea of what she was paying them. Pittance though it was, it would see most of them freed in under two years. They were obviously uncomfortable with that idea. Shallan shook her head, packing away her things. As she walked toward Tyn's tent, Shallan paused at the fire and asked Red to lift her table back into the wagon and secure it there. She did worry about her things, but she no longer kept any spheres in there, and had left it open so Red and Gaz could glimpse inside and see only books. Hopefully there would be no incentive for people to go rooting through them. You dance around the truth too, she thought to herself as she walked away from the fire. Just like those historians you were ranting about. She pretended these men were heroes, but had no illusions about how quickly they could change coats in the wrong circumstances. Tyn's tent was large and well lit. The woman didn't travel like a simple guard. In many ways, she was the most intriguing person here. One of the few lighteyes aside from the merchants themselves. A woman who wore a sword. Shallan peeked in through the open flaps and found several parshmen setting up a meal on a low travel table, meant for people to eat at while sitting on the floor. The parshmen hurried out, and Shallan watched them suspiciously. Tyn herself stood by a window cut into the cloth. She wore her long, tan coat, buckled at the waist and almost closed. It had a dresslike feel to it, though it was far stiffer than any dress Shallan had worn, matched by the stiff trousers the woman wore underneath. "I asked your men," Tyn said without turning, "and they said you hadn't dined yet. I had the parshmen bring enough for two." "Thank you," Shallan said, entering and trying to keep the hesitation from her voice. Among these people, she wasn't a timid girl but a powerful woman. Theoretically. "I've ordered my people to keep the perimeter clear," Tyn said. "We can speak freely." "That is well," Shallan said. "It means," Tyn said, turning around, "that you can tell me who you really are." Stormfather! What did that mean? "I'm Shallan Davar, as I have said." "Yes," Tyn said, walking over and sitting down at the table. "Please," she said, gesturing. Shallan seated herself carefully, using a ladylike posture, with legs bent to the side. Tyn sat crosslegged after flipping her coat out behind her. She dug into her meal, dipping flatbread in a curry that seemed too darkand smelled too pepperyto be feminine. "Men's food?" Shallan asked. "I've always hated those definitions," Tyn said. "I was raised in Tu Bayla by parents who worked as interpreters. I didn't realize certain foods were supposed to be for women or men until I visited my parents' homeland for the first time. Still seems stupid to me. I'll eat what I want, thank you very much." Shallan's own meal was more proper, smelling sweet rather than savory. She ate, only now realizing how hungry she was. "I have a spanreed," Tyn said. Shallan looked up, tip of her bread in her dipping bowl. "It's connected to one over in Tashikk," Tyn continued, "at one of their new information houses. You hire an intermediary there, and they can perform services for you. Research, make inquirieseven relay messages for you via spanreed to any major city in the world. Quite spectacular." "That sounds useful," Shallan said carefully. "Indeed. You can find out all kinds of things. For example, I had my contact find what they could on House Davar. It's apparently a small, outoftheway house with large debts and an erratic house leader who may or may not still be alive. He has a daughter, Shallan, whom nobody seems to have met." "I am that daughter," Shallan said. "So I'd say that 'nobody' is a stretch." "And why," Tyn said, "would an unknown scion of a minor Veden family be traveling the Frostlands with a group of slavers? All the while claiming she's expected at the Shattered Plains, and that her rescue will be celebrated? That she has powerful connections, enough to pay the salaries of a full mercenary troop?" "Truth is sometimes more surprising than a lie." Tyn smiled, then leaned forward. "It's all right; you don't need to keep up the front with me. You're actually doing a good job here. I've discarded my annoyance with you and have decided to be impressed instead. You're new to this, but talented." "This?" Shallan asked. "The art of the con, of course," Tyn said. "The grand act of pretending to be someone you aren't, then running off with the goods. I like what you pulled with those deserters. It was a big gamble, and it paid off. "But now you're in a predicament. You're pretending to be someone several steps above your station, and are promising a grand payoff. I've run that scam before, and the trickiest part is the end. If you don't handle this well, these 'heroes' you've recruited will have no qualms stringing you up by the neck. I've noticed that you're dragging your feet moving us toward the Plains. You're uncertain, aren't you? In over your head?" "Most definitely," Shallan said softly. "Well," Tyn said, digging into her food, "I'm here to help." "At what cost?" This woman certainly did like to talk. Shallan was inclined to let her continue. "I want in on whatever you're planning," Tyn said, stabbing her bread down into the bowl like a sword into a greatshell. "You came all the way here to the Frostlands for something. Your plot is likely no small con, but I can't help but assume you don't have the experience to pull it off." Shallan tapped her finger against the table. Who would she be for this woman? Who did she need to be? She seems like a master con artist, Shallan thought, sweating. I can't fool someone like this. Except that she already had. Accidentally. "How did you end up here?" Shallan asked. "Leading guards on a caravan? Is that part of a con?" Tyn laughed. "This? No, it wouldn't be worth the trouble. I may have exaggerated my experience in talking to the caravan leaders, but I needed to get to the Shattered Plains and didn't have the resources to do it on my own. Not safely." "How does a woman like you end up without resources, though?" Shallan asked, frowning. "I'd think you would never be without." "I'm not," Tyn said, gesturing. "As you can plainly see. You're going to have to get used to rebuilding, if you want to join the profession. It comes, it goes. I got stuck down south without any spheres, and am finding my way to more civilized countries." "To the Shattered Plains," Shallan said. "You have a job there of some sort as well? A . . . con you're intending to pull?" Tyn smiled. "This isn't about me, kid. It's about you, and what I can do for you. I know people in the warcamps. It's practically the new capital of Alethkar; everything interesting in the country is happening there. Money is flowing like rivers after a storm, but everyone considers it a frontier, and so laws are lax. A woman can get ahead if she knows the right people." Tyn leaned forward, and her expression darkened. "But if she doesn't, she can make enemies really quickly. Trust me, you want to know who I know, and you want to work with them. Without their approval, nothing big happens at the Shattered Plains. So I ask you again. What are you hoping to accomplish there?" "I . . . know something about Dalinar Kholin." "Old Blackthorn himself?" Tyn said, surprised. "He's been living a boring life lately, all superior, like he's some hero from the legends." "Yes, well, what I know is going to be very important to him. Very." "Well, what is this secret?" Shallan didn't answer. "Not willing to divulge the goods yet," Tyn said. "Well, that's understandable. Blackmail is a tricky one. You'll be glad you brought me on. You are bringing me on, aren't you?" "Yes," Shallan said. "I do believe I could learn some things from you." Smokeform for hiding and slipping between men. A form of power, like human Surges. Bring it 'round again. Though crafted of gods, It was by Unmade hand. Leaves its force to be but one of foe or friend. From the Listener Song of Histories, 127th stanza Kaladin figured that it took a lot to put him in a situation he'd never before seen. He'd been a slave and a surgeon, served on a battlefield and in a lighteyes' dining room. He'd seen a lot for his twenty years. Too much, it felt at times. He had many memories he'd rather be without. Regardless, he had not expected this day to present him with something so utterly and disconcertingly unfamiliar. "Sir?" he asked, taking a step backward. "You want me to do what?" "Get on that horse," Dalinar Kholin said, pointing toward an animal grazing nearby. The beast would stand perfectly still, waiting for grass to creep up out of its holes. Then it would pounce, taking a quick bite, which would cause the grass to shoot back down into its burrows. It got a mouthful each time, often pulling the grass out by its roots. It was one of many such animals dawdling and prancing through the area. It never ceased to stun Kaladin just how rich people like Dalinar were; each horse was worth spheres in profusion. And Dalinar wanted him to climb on one of them. "Soldier," Dalinar said, "you need to know how to ride. The time might come when you need to guard my sons on the battlefield. Besides, how long did it take you to reach the palace the other night, when coming to hear about the king's accident?" "Almost threequarters of an hour," Kaladin admitted. It had been four days since that night, and Kaladin had frequently found himself on edge since then. "I have stables near the barracks," Dalinar said. "You could have made that trip in a fraction of the time if you could ride. Perhaps you won't spend much of your time in the saddle, but this is going to be an important skill for you and your men to know." Kaladin looked back at the other members of Bridge Four. Shrugs all around a few timid onesexcept for Moash, who nodded eagerly. "I suppose," Kaladin said, looking back at Dalinar. "If you think it's important, sir, we'll give it a try." "Good man," Dalinar said. "I'll send over Jenet, the stablemaster." "We'll await him with eagerness, sir," Kaladin said, trying to sound like he meant it. Two of Kaladin's men escorted Dalinar as he walked toward the stables, a set of large, sturdy stone buildings. From what Kaladin saw, when the horses weren't inside, they were allowed to roam freely inside this open area west of the warcamp. A low stone wall enclosed it, but surely the horses could jump that at will. They didn't. The brutes wandered about, stalking grass or lying down, snorting and whinnying. The entire place smelled strange to Kaladin. Not of dung, just . . . of horse. Kaladin eyed one eating nearby, just inside the wall. He didn't trust it; there was something too smart about horses. Proper beasts of burden like chulls were slow and docile. He'd ride a chull. A creature like this, though . . . who knew what it was thinking? Moash stepped up beside him, watching Dalinar go. "You like him, don't you?" he asked softly. "He's a good commander," Kaladin said, as he instinctively sought out Adolin and Renarin, who were riding their horses nearby. Apparently, the things needed to be exercised periodically to keep them functioning properly. Devilish creatures. "Don't get too close to him, Kal," Moash said, still watching Dalinar. "And don't trust him too far. He's lighteyed, remember." "I'm not likely to forget," Kaladin said dryly. "Besides, you're the one who looked like you'd faint from joy the moment he offered to let us ride these monsters." "Have you ever faced a lighteyes riding one of these things?" Moash asked. "On the battlefield, I mean?" Kaladin remembered thundering hooves, a man in silvery armor. Dead friends. "Yes." "Then you know the advantage it offers," Moash said. "I'll take Dalinar's offer gladly." The stablemaster turned out to be a she. Kaladin raised an eyebrow as the pretty, young lighteyed woman walked up to them, a pair of grooms in tow. She wore a traditional Vorin gown, though it wasn't silk but something coarser, and was slit up the front and back, ankle to thigh. Underneath, she wore a feminine pair of trousers. The woman wore her dark hair in a tail, no ornaments, and had a tautness to her face that he didn't expect in a lighteyed woman. "The highprince says I'm to let you ruffians touch my horses," Jenet said, folding her arms. "I'm not pleased about it." "Fortunately," Kaladin said, "neither are we." She looked him up and down. "You're that one, aren't you? The one everyone is talking about?" "Maybe." She sniffed. "You need a haircut. All right, listen up, soldier boys! We're going to do this properly. I won't have you hurting my horses, all right? You listen, and you listen well." What proceeded was one of the dullest, most protracted lectures of Kaladin's life. The woman went on and on about posturestraightbacked, but not too tense. About getting the horses to movenudges with the heels, nothing too sharp. About how to ride, how to respect the animal, how to hold the reins properly and how to balance. All before being allowed to even touch one of the creatures. Eventually, the boredom was interrupted by the arrival of a man on horseback. Unfortunately, it was Adolin Kholin, riding that white monster of a horse of his. It was several hands taller than the one Jenet was showing them. Adolin's almost looked a completely different species, with those massive hooves, glistening white coat, and unfathomable eyes. Adolin looked the bridgemen over with a smirk, then caught the stablemaster's eye and smiled in a less condescending way. "Jenet," he said. "Looking fetching today, as always. Is that a new riding dress?" The woman bent down without lookingshe was now talking about how to guide the horsesand selected a stone from the ground. Then she turned and threw it at Adolin. The princeling flinched, raising an arm protectively over his face, though Jenet's aim was off. "Oh, come on now," Adolin said. "You're not still sore that" Another rock. This one clipped him on the arm. "Right, then," Adolin said, jogging his horse away, hunched down to present a smaller target for rocks. Eventually, after demonstrating saddling and bridling on her horse, Jenet finished the lecture and deemed them worthy of touching some horses. A flock of her grooms, both male and female, scurried out onto the field to select proper mounts for the six bridgemen. "Lots of women on your staff," Kaladin noted to Jenet as the grooms worked. "Horseback riding isn't mentioned in Arts and Majesty," she replied. "Horses weren't terribly well known back then. Radiants had Ryshadium, but even kings had little access to ordinary horses." She wore her safehand in a sleeve, unlike most of the darkeyed groom women, who wore gloves. "Which matters because . . . ?" Kaladin said. Frowning, she looked at him, baffled. "Arts and Majesty . . ." she prompted. "Foundation of masculine and feminine arts . . . Of course. I keep looking at those captain's knots on your shoulder, but" "But I'm just an ignorant darkeyes?" "Sure, if that's how you want to put it. Whatever. Look, I'm not going to give you a lecture on the artsI'm tired of talking to you people already. Let's just say that anyone who wants can be a groom, all right?" She lacked a polished refinement that Kaladin had come to expect in lighteyed women, and he found it refreshing. Better a woman who was overtly condescending than the alternative. The grooms walked the horses out of their enclosure and to a riding ground, shaped like a ring. A group of parshmen with eyes downcast brought the saddles, saddle pads, and bridlesequipment that, following Jenet's lecture, Kaladin could name. Kaladin selected a beast that didn't look too evil, a shorter horse with a shaggy mane and a brown coat. He saddled it with help from a groom. Nearby, Moash finished and threw himself up into his saddle. Once the groom let go, Moash's horse wandered off without him asking it to do so. "Hey!" Moash said. "Stop. Whoa. How do I get it to stop walking?" "You dropped the reins," Jenet called after him. "Storming fool! Were you even listening?" "Reins," Moash said, scrambling for them. "Can't I just slap it over the head with a reed, like you do a chull?" Jenet rubbed her forehead. Kaladin looked into the eye of his own chosen beast. "Look," he said softly, "you don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. Let's just be pleasant to one another and get it over with as quickly as possible." The horse snorted softly. Kaladin took a deep breath, then grabbed the saddle as instructed, lifting one foot into the stirrup. He rocked a few times, then threw himself up into the saddle. He grabbed the saddle horn in a death grip and held on tight, ready to be thrown about as the beast went charging away. His horse bent her head and began licking some rocks. "Hey, now," Kaladin said, raising the reins. "Come on. Let's move." The horse ignored him. Kaladin tried cuing it in the flanks as he'd been told. The horse didn't budge. "You're supposed to be some kind of wagon with legs," Kaladin said to the thing. "You're worth more than a village. Prove it to me. Get going! Forward! Onward!" The horse licked the rocks. What is the thing doing? Kaladin thought, leaning to the side. With surprise, he noticed grass poking out of its holes. Licking fools the grass into thinking rain has come. Often after a storm, plants would unfold to glut themselves on the water even if insects decided to chew them. Clever beast. Lazy. But clever. "You need to show her you're in charge," Jenet said, wandering past. "Tighten the reins, sit up straight, pull her head up, and don't let her eat. She'll walk all over you if you aren't firm." Kaladin tried to obey, and did managefinallyto pull the horse away from her meal. The horse did smell odd, but it wasn't a bad smell really. He got her walking, and once that happened, steering wasn't that difficult. It felt strange to have some other thing in control of where he was going, however. Yes, he had the reins, but at any time this horse could just up and take off running and he'd be unable to do anything about it. Half of Jenet's training had been about not spooking the horsesabout remaining still if one started to gallop, and about never surprising one from behind. It looked higher from atop the horse than he'd assumed it would. That was a long fall to the ground. He guided the horse about, and after a short time, he managed to pull up beside Natam on purpose. The longfaced bridgeman held his reins as if they were precious gemstones, afraid to yank them or direct his horse. "Can't believe people ride these things on storming purpose," Natam said. He had a rural Alethi accent, his words bluntly clipped, like he was biting them off before he'd quite finished them. "I mean, we ain't moving any faster than walking, right?" Again, Kaladin remembered the image of that charging mounted Shardbearer from long ago. Yes, Kaladin could see the reason for horses. Sitting up higher made it easier to strike with power, and the size of the horseits bulk and momentumfrightened soldiers on foot and sent them scattering. "I think most go faster than these," Kaladin said. "I'd bet they gave us the old horses to practice on." "Yeah, I suppose," Natam said. "It's warm. Didn't expect that. I've ridden chulls before. This thing shouldn't be so . . . warm. Hard to feel like this thing is worth as much as it is. It's like I'm riding about on a pile of emerald broams." He hesitated, glancing backward. "Only, emeralds' backsides ain't nearly so busy . . ." "Natam," Kaladin asked. "Do you remember much about the day when someone tried to kill the king?" "Oh, sure," Natam said. "I was with the guys who ran out there and found him flapping in the wind, like the Stormfather's own ears." Kaladin smiled. Once, this man would barely say two sentences together, instead always staring at the ground, somber. Used up by his time as a bridgeman. These last few weeks had been good for Natam. Good for them all. "Before the storm that night," Kaladin said. "Was anyone out on the balcony? Any servants you didn't recognize? Any soldiers who weren't from the King's Guard?" "No servants that I recall," Natam said, squinting. The oncefarmer got a pensive look on his face. "I guarded the king all day, sir, with the King's Guard. Ain't nothing standing out to me. I Whoa!" His horse had suddenly picked up speed, outpacing Kaladin's. "Think about it!" Kaladin called to him. "See what you can remember!" Natam nodded, still holding his reins like they were glass, refusing to pull them tight or steer the horse. Kaladin shook his head. A small horse galloped past him. In the air. Made of light. Syl giggled, changing shape and spinning around as a ribbon of light before settling on the neck of Kaladin's horse, just in front of him. She lounged back, grinning, then frowned at his expression. "You're not enjoying yourself," Syl said. "You're starting to sound a lot like my mother." "Captivating?" Syl said. "Amazing, witty, meaningful?" "Repetitive." "Captivating?" Syl said. "Amazing, witty, meaningful?" "Very funny." "Says the man not laughing," she replied, folding her arms. "All right, so what is drearifying you today?" "Drearifying?" Kaladin frowned. "Is that a word?" "You don't know?" He shook his head. "Yes," Syl said solemnly. "Yes, it absolutely is." "Something's off," he said. "About the conversation I just had with Natam." He tugged on the reins, stopping the horse from trying to bend down and nibble at grass again. The thing was very focused. "What did you talk about?" "The assassination attempt," Kaladin said, narrowing his eyes. "And if he'd seen anyone before the . . ." He paused. "Before the storm." He looked down and met Syl's eyes. "The storm itself would have blown down the railing," Kaladin said. "Bending it!" Syl said, standing up and grinning. "Ooohhh . . ." "It was cut clean through, the mortar on the bottom chipped away," Kaladin continued. "I'll bet the force of the winds was easily equal to the weight the king put on it." "So the sabotage must have happened after the storm," Syl said. A much narrower time frame. Kaladin turned his horse toward where Natam was riding. Unfortunately, catching up wasn't easy. Natam was moving at a trot, much to his obvious dismay, and Kaladin couldn't get his mount to go faster. "Having trouble, bridgeboy?" Adolin asked, trotting up. Kaladin glanced at the princeling. Stormfather, but it was difficult not to feel tiny when riding beside that monster of Adolin's. Kaladin tried to kick his horse faster. She kept clopping along at her one speed, walking around the circle here that was a kind of running track for horses. "Spray might have been fast during her youth," Adolin said, nodding at Kaladin's mount, "but that was fifteen years ago. I'm surprised she's still around, honestly, but she seems perfectly suited for training children. And bridgemen." Kaladin ignored him, eyes forward, still trying to get the horse to pick up her pace and catch Natam. "Now, if you want something with more spunk," Adolin said, pointing toward the side, "Dreamstorm over there might be more to your liking." He indicated a larger, leaner animal in its own enclosure, saddled and roped to a pole firmly mortared into a hole in the ground. The long rope let it run in short bursts, though only around in a circle. It tossed its head, snorting. Adolin heeled his own animal forward and past Natam. Dreamstorm, eh? Kaladin thought, inspecting the creature. It certainly did seem to have more spunk than Spray. It also looked like it wanted to take a bite out of anyone who drew too close. Kaladin turned Spray in that direction. Once near, he slowedSpray was all too happy to do thatand climbed off. Doing so proved more difficult than he'd expected, but he managed to avoid tripping onto his face. Once down, he put his hands on his hips and inspected the running horse inside its fence. "Weren't you just complaining," Syl said, walking up onto Spray's head, "that you'd rather walk than let a horse carry you about?" "Yeah," Kaladin said. He hadn't realized it, but he had been holding some Stormlight. Just a tad. It escaped when he spoke, invisible unless he looked closely and detected a slight warping of the air. "So what are you doing thinking about riding that?" "This horse," he said, nodding to Spray, "is only for walking. I can walk just fine on my own. That other one, that's an animal for war." Moash was right. Horses were an advantage on the battlefield, so Kaladin should be at least familiar with them. The same argument Zahel made to me about learning to fight against a Shardblade, Kaladin thought with discomfort. And I turned him down. "What do you think you're doing?" Jenet asked, riding up to him. "I'm going to get on that," Kaladin said, pointing at Dreamstorm. Jenet snorted. "She'll throw you in a heartbeat and you'll break your crown, bridgeman. She's not good with riders." "She has a saddle on." "So she can get used to wearing one." The horse finished a round of cantering and slowed. "I don't like that look in your eyes," Jenet told him, turning her own animal to the side. It stomped impatiently, as if eager to be running. "I'm going to give it a try," Kaladin said, walking forward. "You won't even be able to get on," Jenet said. She watched him carefully, as if curious what he'd dothough it seemed to him she might be more worried for the horse's safety than his. Syl alighted on Kaladin's shoulder as he walked. "This is going to be like back at the lighteyed practice grounds, isn't it?" Kaladin asked. "I'm going to end up on my back, staring at the sky, feeling like a fool." "Probably," Syl said lightly. "So why are you doing this? Because of Adolin?" "Nah," Kaladin said. "The princeling can storm away." "Then why?" "Because I'm scared of these things." Syl looked at him, seeming baffled, but it made perfect sense to Kaladin. Ahead, Dreamstormhuffing out huge breaths from her runlooked at him. She met his eyes. "Storms!" Adolin's voice called from behind. "Bridgeboy, don't actually do it! Are you mad?" Kaladin stepped up to the horse. She danced a few steps back, but let him touch the saddle. So he breathed in a little more Stormlight and threw himself at the saddle. "Damnation! What" Adolin shouted. That was all Kaladin heard. His Stormlightaided leap let him get higher than an ordinary man could probably have managed, but his aim was off. He got hold of the pommel and threw one leg over, but the horse started thrashing. The beast was incredibly strong, a distinct and powerful contrast to Spray. Kaladin was quite nearly hurled from the seat on the first buck. With a wild swipe of the hand, Kaladin poured Stormlight onto the saddle and stuck himself in place. That only meant that instead of being tossed from horseback like a limp cloth, he got whipped back and forth like a limp cloth. He somehow managed to get hold of the horse's mane and, with teeth gritted, did his best to keep from being bounced senseless. The stable grounds were a blur. The only sounds he could hear were his beating heart and the smashing hooves. The Voidbringer beast moved like a storm itself, but Kaladin was stuck to the saddle as surely as if he'd been nailed there. After what seemed an eternity, the horseblowing out big, frothy breaths stilled. Kaladin's swimming vision cleared to show a group of bridgemenkeeping their distancecheering him on. Adolin and Jenet, both mounted, stared at him with what seemed to be a mixture of horror and awe. Kaladin grinned. Then, in one last, powerful motion, Dreamstorm bucked him free. He hadn't realized that the Stormlight in the saddle was exhausted. In a fitting fulfillment of his earlier prediction, Kaladin found himself dazed, lying on his back staring at the sky, having trouble remembering the last few seconds of his life. A number of painspren wiggled out of the ground beside him, little orange hands that grabbed this way and that. An equine head with unfathomably dark eyes leaned down over Kaladin. The horse snorted at him. The smell was moist and grassy. "You monster," Kaladin said. "You waited until I was relaxed, then threw me." The horse snorted again, and Kaladin found himself laughing. Storms, but that had felt good! He couldn't explain why, but the act of clinging for dear life to the thrashing animal had been truly exhilarating. As Kaladin stood and dusted himself off, Dalinar himself broke through the crowd, brow furrowed. Kaladin hadn't realized the highprince had still been nearby. He looked from Dreamstorm to Kaladin, then raised an eyebrow. "You don't chase down assassins on a placid mount, sir," Kaladin said, saluting. "Yes," Dalinar said, "but it is customary to start training men by using weapons without edges, soldier. Are you all right?" "Fine, sir," Kaladin said. "Well, it seems your men are taking to the training," Dalinar said. "I'm going to put in a requisition release. You and five others you select are to come here and practice every day for the next few weeks." "Yes, sir." He'd find the time. Somehow. "Good," Dalinar said. "I received your proposal for initial patrols outside of the warcamps, and thought it looked good. Why don't you start in two weeks, and bring some horses with you to practice out in the field." Jenet made a strangled sound. "Outside the city, Brightlord? But . . . bandits . . ." "The horses are here to be used, Jenet," Dalinar said. "Captain, you'll be sure to bring enough troops to protect the horses, won't you?" "Yes, sir," Kaladin said. "Good. But do leave that one behind," Dalinar said, waving toward Dreamstorm. "Er, yes, sir." Dalinar nodded, moving off and raising his hand toward someone Kaladin couldn't see. Kaladin rubbed his elbow, which he'd smacked. The remaining Stormlight in his body had healed his head first, then run out before getting to his arm. Bridge Four moved to their horses as Jenet called out for them to remount and start a second phase of training. Kaladin found himself standing near Adolin, who remained mounted. "Thanks," Adolin said, grudgingly. "For?" Kaladin asked, walking past him toward Spray, who continued to chew at grass, uncaring of the fuss. "Not telling Father I put you up to that." "I'm not an idiot, Adolin," Kaladin said, swinging into his saddle. "I could see what I was getting myself into." He turned his horse away from her meal with some difficulty, and got some more pointers from a groom. Eventually, Kaladin trotted over toward Natam again. The gait was bouncy, but he mostly got the hang of moving with the horsethey called it postingto keep from slapping around too much. Natam watched him as he moved up. "That's unfair, sir." "What I did with Dreamstorm?" "No. The way you just ride like that. Seems so natural for you." Didn't feel that way. "I want to talk some more about that night." "Sir?" the longfaced man asked. "I haven't thought of anything yet. Been a little distracted." "I have another question," Kaladin said, bringing their horses up beside one another. "I asked you about your shift during the day, but what about right after I left? Did anyone other than the king go out onto the balcony?" "Just guards, sir," Natam said. "Tell me which ones," Kaladin said. "Maybe they saw something." Natam shrugged. "I mainly watched the door. The king remained in the sitting room for a time. I guess Moash went out." "Moash," Kaladin said, frowning. "Wasn't his shift supposed to be done soon?" "Yeah," Natam said. "He stayed around a little extra time; said he wanted to see the king settled. While waiting, Moash went out to watch the balcony. You usually want one of us out there." "Thanks," Kaladin said. "I'll ask him." Kaladin found Moash diligently listening to Jenet explain something. Moash seemed to have picked up riding quicklyhe seemed to pick up everything quickly. Certainly, he'd been the best student among the bridgemen when it came to fighting. Kaladin watched him for a few moments, frowning. Then it struck him. What are you thinking? That Moash might have had something to do with the assassination attempt? Don't be stupid. That was ridiculous. Besides, the man didn't have a Shardblade. Kaladin turned his horse away. As he did, however, he saw the person Dalinar had gone to meet. Brightlord Amaram. The two were too far away for Kaladin to hear them, but he could see the amusement on Dalinar's face. Adolin and Renarin rode up to them, smiling broadly as Amaram waved to them. The anger that surged within Kaladinsudden, passionate, almost chokingly strongmade him clench his fists. His breath hissed out. That surprised him. He'd thought the hatred buried deeper than that. He turned his horse pointedly the other direction, suddenly looking forward to the chance to go on patrol with the new recruits. Getting away from the warcamps sounded very good to him. They blame our people For the loss of that land. The city that once covered it Did range the eastern strand. The power made known in the tomes of our clan Our gods were not who shattered these plains. From the Listener Song of Wars, 55th stanza Adolin crashed into the Parshendi line, ignoring weapons, throwing his shoulder against the enemy at the front. The Parshendi man grunted, his song faltering, as Adolin spun about himself and swept with his Shardblade. Tugs on the weapon marked when it passed through flesh. Adolin came out of his spin, ignoring the glow of Stormlight coming from a crack at his shoulder. Around him, bodies dropped, eyes burning in their skulls. Adolin's breath, hot and humid, filled his helm as he puffed in and out. There, he thought, raising his Blade and charging, his men filling in around him. Not those bridgemen, for once, but real soldiers. He'd left the bridgemen back on the assault plateau. He didn't want men around him who didn't want to fight Parshendi. Adolin and his soldiers pushed through the Parshendi, joining up with a frantic set of soldiers in green uniforms with gold accents, led by a Shardbearer in matching colors. The man fought with a large Shardbearer's hammerhe had no Blade of his own. Adolin pushed through to him. "Jakamav?" he asked. "You all right?" "All right?" Jakamav asked, voice muffled by his helm. He slammed the faceplate up, revealing a grin. "I'm wonderful." He laughed, pale green eyes alight with the Thrill of the fight. Adolin recognized that feeling well. "You were almost surrounded!" Adolin said, turning to face a group of Parshendi running up in pairs. Adolin respected them for coming at Shardbearers, rather than fleeing. It meant almost certain death, but if you won, you could turn the tide of a battle. Jakamav laughed, sounding as pleased now as when enjoying a winehouse singer, and that laughter was infectious. Adolin found himself grinning as he engaged the Parshendi, sweeping them down with blow after blow. He never enjoyed simple warfare as much as a good duel, but for the moment, despite its crassness, he found challenge and joy in the fight. Moments later, the dead lying at his feet, he spun about and searched for another challenge. This plateau was shaped very strangely; it had been a tall hill before the Plains were shattered, but half of it had ended up on the adjacent plateau. He couldn't imagine what kind of force would have split the hill down the center, as opposed to cracking it at the base. Well, it wasn't an ordinaryshaped hill, so maybe that had something to do with the split. It was shaped more like a wide, flat pyramid with only three steps. A large base, a second plateau atop it that was perhaps a hundred feet across, then a third, smaller peak atop the other two, placed right in the center. Almost like a cake with three tiers that had been cut with a large knife right down the center. Adolin and Jakamav fought on the second tier of the battlefield. Technically, Adolin wasn't required to be on this run. It wasn't his army's turn in the rotation. However, the time had come to implement another part of Dalinar's plan. Adolin had arrived with only a small strike force, but it was a good thing he had. Jakamav had been surrounded up here, on the second tier, and the regular army hadn't been able to break through. Now, the Parshendi had been pushed back to the sides of this tier. They still held the top tier completely; it was where the chrysalis had appeared. That put them in a bad position. Yes, they had the high ground, but they also had to hold the slopes between tiers to secure their withdrawal. They'd obviously hoped to get the harvesting done before the humans arrived. Adolin kicked a Parshendi soldier over the edge, toppling him down thirty feet or so onto those fighting on the bottom tier, then looked to his right. The slope upward was there, but the Parshendi had the approach clogged. He'd really like to reach the top. . . . He looked at the sheer cliff face between his tier and the one above. "Jakamav," he called, pointing. Jakamav followed Adolin's gesture, looking upward. Then stepped back from the fighting. "That's crazy!" Jakamav said as Adolin jogged up. "Sure is." "Let's be at it, then!" He handed his hammer to Adolin, who slipped it into the sheath on his friend's back. Then the two of them ran to the rock wall and started to climb. Adolin's Plated fingers ground against rock as he pulled himself straight up. Soldiers below cheered them on. There were handholds aplenty, though he would never have wanted to do this without Plate to propel his climb and protect him if he fell. It was still crazy; they'd end up surrounded. However, two Shardbearers could do amazing things when supporting one another. Besides, if they got overwhelmed, they could always jump off the cliff, assuming their Plate was healthy enough to survive the fall. It was the sort of risky move that Adolin would never dare when his father was on the battlefield. He paused halfway up the cliff. Parshendi gathered on the edge of the tier above, preparing for them. "You have a plan for getting a foothold up there?" Jakamav asked, clinging to the rocks beside Adolin. Adolin nodded. "Just be ready to support me." "Sure." Jakamav scanned the heights, face hidden behind his helm. "What are you doing here, by the way?" "I figured no army would turn away some Shardbearers who wanted to help." "Shardbearers? Plural?" "Renarin is down below." "Hopefully not fighting." "He's surrounded by a large squad of soldiers with careful instructions not to let him get into the fighting. Father wanted him to see a few of these, though." "I know what Dalinar is doing," Jakamav said. "He's trying to show a spirit of cooperation, trying to get the highprinces to stop being rivals. So he sends his Shardbearers to help, even when the run isn't his." "Are you complaining?" "Nope. Let's see you make an opening up there. I'll need a moment to get the hammer out." Adolin grinned inside his helmet, then continued climbing. Jakamav was a landlord and Shardbearer under Highprince Roion, and a fairly good friend. It was important that lighteyes like Jakamav saw Dalinar and Adolin actively working toward a better Alethkar. Perhaps a few episodes like this would show the value of a trustworthy alliance, instead of the backstabbing, temporary coalition Sadeas represented. Adolin climbed farther, Jakamav close behind, until he was a dozen feet from the top. The Parshendi clustered there, hammers and maces at the ready weapons for fighting a man in Shardplate. A few farther down launched arrows, which bounced ineffectively off the Plate. All right, Adolin thought, holding his hand to the sideclinging to the rocks with the otherand summoned his Blade. He slammed it directly into the rock wall with the flat of the blade facing upward. He climbed up beside the sword. Then he stepped onto the flat of the blade. Shardblades couldn't breakthey could barely bendso it held him. He suddenly had leverage and good footing, and so when he crouched down and leaped, the Plate hurled him upward. As he passed the edge of the top tier, he grabbed the rock therejust beneath the feet of the Parshendiand pulled on it to throw himself into the waiting foe. They broke off their singing as he smashed into them with the force of a boulder. He got his feet underneath him, mentally sending a summons to his Blade, then slammed his shoulder into one group. He began to lay about himself with punches, smashing the chest of one Parshendi, then the head of another. The soldiers' carapace armor cracked with sickening sounds, and the punches flung them backward, knocking some off the cliff. Adolin took a few hits on his forearms before his Blade finally reformed in his hands. He swung about, so focused on holding his ground that he didn't notice Jakamav until the Shardbearer in green fell in beside him, crushing Parshendi with his hammer. "Thanks for tossing a platoon's worth of Parshendi down on my head," Jakamav called as he swung. "That was a wonderful surprise." Adolin grinned, pointing. "Chrysalis." The top tier wasn't well populatedthough more Parshendi were flooding up the incline. He and Jakamav had a direct path to the chrysalis, a hulking, oblong boulder of brown and faint green. It was matted to the rocks with the same stuff that made up its shell. Adolin leaped over the twitching form of a Parshendi with dead legs and charged the chrysalis, Jakamav following at a clanking jog. Getting to a gemheart was toughthe chrysalises had skin like rockbut with a Shardblade, it could be easy. They just had to kill the thing, then cut a hole so they could rip out the heart and The chrysalis was already open. "No!" Adolin said, scrambling up to it, grabbing the sides of the hole and peering into the slushy violet interior. Chunks of carapace floated within the goop, and a conspicuous gap lay where the gemheart normally connected to veins and sinew. Adolin spun, searching across the top of the plateau. Jakamav clanked up and cursed. "How did they get it out so quickly?" There. Nearby, Parshendi soldiers scattered, yelling in their impenetrable, rhythmic language. Standing behind them was a tall figure in silvery Shardplate, a red cloak billowing out behind. The armor had peaked joints, ridges rising like the points on a crab's shell. The figure was easily seven feet tall, the armor making him look massive, perhaps because it covered a Parshendi who had that carapace armor growing from his skin. "It's him!" Adolin said, running forward. This was the one his father had fought on the Tower, the only Shardbearer they'd seen among the Parshendi for weeks, maybe months. Perhaps the last one they had. The Shardbearer turned toward Adolin, gripping a large uncut gemstone in his hand. It dripped ichor and plasma. "Fight me!" Adolin said. A group of Parshendi soldiers charged past the Shardbearer, running toward the long dropoff at the back of the formation, where the hill had been split down the center. The Shardbearer handed his gemheart to one of these charging men, then turned and watched them jump. They soared across the gap to land on the top of the other half of the hill, the one on the adjacent plateau. It still amazed Adolin that these Parshendi soldiers could leap chasms. He felt a fool as he realized that these heights were not a trap for them as they would be for humans. To them, a mountain split in half was just another chasm to leap. More and more of the Parshendi made the leap, flowing away from the humans below and jumping to safety. Adolin did spot one who stumbled as he leapt. The poor fellow screamed as he plummeted into the chasm. This was dangerous for them, but it was obviously less so than trying to fight off the humans. The Shardbearer remained. Adolin ignored the fleeing Parshendiignored Jakamav, who called for him to fall backand ran up to that Shardbearer, swinging his Blade full force. The Parshendi raised his own Blade, slapping aside Adolin's blow. "You are the son, Adolin Kholin," the Parshendi said. "Your father? Where is?" Adolin froze in place. The words were in Alethiheavily accented, yes, but understandable. The Shardbearer slammed up his faceplate. And, to Adolin's shock, there was no beard on that face. Didn't that make this a woman? Telling the difference with Parshendi was difficult for him. The vocal timbre was rough and lowpitched, though he supposed it could be feminine. "I must need speak to Dalinar," the woman said, stepping forward. "I met him one time, much long ago." "You refused our every messenger," Adolin said, backing away, sword out. "Now you wish to speak with us?" "That was long ago. Time does change." Stormfather. Something inside of Adolin urged him to go in swinging, to batter this Shardbearer down and get some answers, win some Shards. Fight! He was here to fight! His father's voice, in the back of his mind, held him at bay. Dalinar would want this chance. It could change the course of the entire war. "He will want to contact you," Adolin said, taking a deep breath, shoving down the Thrill of battle. "How?" "Will send messenger," the Shardbearer said. "Do not kill one who comes." She raised her Shardblade toward him in salute, then let it drop and dematerialize. She turned to charge toward the chasm and hurled herself across in a prodigious leap. * * * Adolin pulled off his helm as he strode across the plateau. Surgeons saw to the wounded while the hale sat around in groups, drinking water and grousing about their failure. A rare mood hovered over the armies of Roion and Ruthar this day. Usually when the Alethi lost a plateau run it was because the Parshendi pushed them back in a wild scrambling retreat across bridges. It wasn't often that a run ended with the Alethi controlling the plateau, but with no gemheart to show for it. He released one gauntlet, the straps undoing themselves automatically at his will, then hooked it at his waist. He used a sweaty hand to push back sweatier hair. Now where had Renarin gotten to? There, on the staging plateau, sitting on a rock surrounded by guards. Adolin tromped across one of the bridges, raising a hand to Jakamav, who was removing his Plate nearby. He'd want to ride back in comfort. Adolin jogged up to his brother, who sat on a boulder with his helm off, staring at the ground in front of him. "Hey," Adolin said. "Ready to head back?" Renarin nodded. "What happened?" Adolin asked. Renarin continued staring at the ground. Finally, one of the bridgeman guards a compact man with silvering hairnodded his head to the side. Adolin walked with him a short distance away. "A group of shellheads tried to seize one of the bridges, Brightlord," the bridgeman said softly. "Brightlord Renarin insisted on going to help. Sir, we tried hard to dissuade him. Then, when he got near and summoned his Blade, he just kind of . . . stood there. We got him away, sir, but he's been sitting on that rock ever since." One of Renarin's fits. "Thank you, soldier," Adolin said. He walked back over and laid his ungauntleted hand on Renarin's shoulder. "It's all right, Renarin. It happens." Renarin shrugged again. Well, if he was in one of his moods, there was nothing to do but let him stew. The younger man would talk about it when he was ready. Adolin organized his two hundred troops, then paid his respects to the highprinces. Neither seemed very grateful. In fact, Ruthar seemed convinced that Adolin and Jakamav's stunt had driven the Parshendi off with the gemheart. As if they wouldn't have withdrawn the moment they had it anyway. Idiot. Adolin smiled affably, regardless. Hopefully Father was right, and the extended hand of fellowship would help. Personally, Adolin just wanted a chance at each of them in the dueling ring, where he could teach them a little respect. On his way back to his army, he searched out Jakamav, who sat under a small pavilion, having a cup of wine as he watched the rest of his army trudge back across the bridges. There were a lot of slumped shoulders and long faces. Jakamav gestured for his steward to get Adolin a cup of sparkling yellow wine. Adolin took it in his unarmored hand, though he didn't drink. "That was quite nearly awesome," Jakamav said, staring out at the battle plateau. From this lower vantage, it looked truly imposing, with those three tiers. Almost looks manmade, Adolin thought idly, considering the shape. "Nearly," Adolin agreed. "Can you imagine what an assault would look like if we had twenty or thirty Shardbearers on the battlefield at once? What chance would the Parshendi have?" Jakamav grunted. "Your father and the king are seriously committed to this course, aren't they?" "As am I." "I can see what you and your father are doing here, Adolin. But if you keep dueling, you're going to lose your Shards. Even you can't always win. Eventually you'll hit an off day. Then it will all be gone." "I might lose at some point," Adolin agreed. "Of course by then I'll have won half the Shards in the kingdom, so I should be able to arrange a replacement." Jakamav sipped his wine, smiling. "You are a cocky bastard, I'll give you that." Adolin smiled, then settled down in a squat beside Jakamav's chairhe couldn't sit in one himself, not in Shardplateso he could meet his friend's eyes. "The truth is, Jakamav, I'm not really worried about losing my Shards I'm more worried about finding duels in the first place. I can't seem to get any Shardbearers to agree to a bout, at least not for Shards." "There have been certain . . . inducements going around," Jakamav admitted. "Promises made to Shardbearers if they refused you." "Sadeas." Jakamav inspected his wine. "Try Eranniv. He's been boasting that he's better than the standings give him credit for. Knowing him, he'll see everyone else refusing, and see it as an opportunity for him to do something spectacular. He's pretty good, though." "So am I," Adolin said. "Thanks, Jak. I owe you." "What's this I hear about you being betrothed?" Storms. How had that gotten out? "It's just a causal," Adolin said. "And it might not even get that far. The woman's ship seems to have been severely delayed." Two weeks now, with no word. Even Aunt Navani was getting worried. Jasnah should have sent word. "I never thought you were the type to let yourself be nailed into an arranged marriage, Adolin," Jakamav said. "There are lots of winds to ride out there, you know?" "Like I said," Adolin replied, "it's far from official." He still didn't know how he felt about all this. Part of him had wanted to push back simply because he resisted being subject to Jasnah's manipulation. But then, his recent track record wasn't anything to boast of. After what had happened with Danlan . . . It wasn't his fault, was it, that he was a friendly man? Why did every woman have to be so jealous? The idea of letting someone else just take care of it all for him was more tempting than he'd ever publicly admit. "I can tell you the details," Adolin said. "Maybe at the winehouse later tonight? Bring Inkima? You can tell me how stupid I'm being, give me some perspective." Jakamav stared at his wine. "What?" Adolin asked. "Being seen with you isn't good for one's reputation these days, Adolin," Jakamav said. "Your father and the king aren't particularly popular." "It will all blow over." "I'm sure it will," Jakamav said. "So let's . . . wait until then, shall we?" Adolin blinked, the words hitting him harder than any blow on the battlefield. "Sure," Adolin forced himself to say. "Good man." Jakamav actually had the audacity to smile at him and lift his cup of wine. Adolin set aside his own cup untouched and stalked off. Sureblood was ready and waiting for him when he reached his men. Adolin moved to swing into the saddle, stewing, but the white Ryshadium nudged him with a butt of the head. Adolin sighed, scratching at the horse's ears. "Sorry," he said. "Haven't been paying much attention to you lately, have I?" He gave the horse a good scratch, and felt somewhat better after climbing into the saddle. Adolin patted Sureblood's neck, and the horse pranced a bit as they started moving. He often did that when Adolin was feeling annoyed, as if trying to improve his master's mood. His four guards for the day followed behind him. They'd obligingly brought their old bridge from Sadeas's army to get Adolin's team where they needed to go. They seemed to find it very amusing that Adolin had his soldiers take shifts carrying the thing. Storming Jakamav. This has been coming, Adolin admitted to himself. The more you defend Father, the more they'll pull away. They were like children. Father really was right. Did Adolin have any true friends? Anyone who would actually stand by him when things were difficult? He knew practically everyone of note in the warcamps. Everyone knew him. How many of them actually cared? "I didn't have a fit," Renarin said softly. Adolin shook out of his brooding. They rode side by side, though Adolin's mount was several hands taller. With Adolin astride a Ryshadium, Renarin looked like a child on a pony by comparison, even in his Plate. Clouds had rolled across the sun, giving some relief from the glare, though the air had turned cold lately and it looked like winter was here for a season. The empty plateaus stretched ahead, barren and broken. "I just stood there," Renarin said. "I wasn't frozen because of my . . . ailment. I'm just a coward." "You're no coward," Adolin said. "I've seen you act as brave as any man. Remember the chasmfiend hunt?" Renarin shrugged. "You don't know how to fight, Renarin," Adolin said. "It's a good thing you froze. You're too new at this to go into battle right now." "I shouldn't be. You started training when you were six." "That's different." "You're different, you mean," Renarin said, eyes forward. He wasn't wearing his spectacles. Why was that? Didn't he need them? Trying to act like he doesn't, Adolin thought. Renarin so desperately wanted to be useful on a battlefield. He'd resisted all suggestions that he should become an ardent and pursue scholarship, as might have better suited him. "You just need more training," Adolin said. "Zahel will whip you into shape. Just give it time. You'll see." "I need to be ready," Renarin said. "Something is coming." The way he said it gave Adolin a shiver. "You're talking about the numbers on the walls." Renarin nodded. They'd found another scratched set of them, after the recent highstorm, outside Father's room. Fortynine days. A new storm comes. According to the guards, nobody had gone in or outdifferent men from last time, which made it unlikely it had been one of them. Storms. That had been scratched on the wall while Adolin had been sleeping just one room away. Who, or what, had done it? "Need to be ready," Renarin said. "For the coming storm. So little time . . ." FIVE YEARS AGO Shallan longed to stay outside. Here in the gardens, people didn't scream at each other. Here there was peace. Unfortunately, it was a fake peacea peace of carefully planted shalebark and cultivated vines. A fabrication, designed to amuse and distract. More and more she longed to escape and visit places where the plants weren't carefully trimmed into shapes, where people didn't step lightly, as if afraid of causing a rockslide. A place away from the shouting. A cool mountain breeze came down from the heights and swept through the gardens, making vines shy backward. She sat away from the flowerbeds, and the sneezing they would bring her, instead studying a section of sturdy shalebark. The cremling she sketched turned at the wind, its enormous feelers twitching, before leaning back down to chew on the shalebark. There were so many kinds of cremlings. Had anyone tried to count them all? By luck, her father had owned a drawing bookone of the works of Dandos the Oilswornand she used that for instruction, letting it rest open beside her. A yell sounded from inside the nearby manor house. Shallan's hand stiffened, making an errant streak across her sketch. She took a deep breath and tried to return to her drawing, but another series of shouts put her on edge. She set her pencil down. She was nearly out of sheets from the latest stack her brother had brought her. He returned unpredictably but never for long, and when he came, he and Father avoided one another. Nobody in the manor knew where Helaran went when he left. She lost track of time, staring at a blank sheet of paper. That happened to her sometimes. When she raised her eyes, the sky was darkening. Almost time for Father's feast. He had those regularly now. Shallan packed up her things in the satchel, then took off her sun hat and walked toward the manor house. Tall and imposing, the building was an exemplar of the Veden ideal. Solitary, strong, towering. A work of square blocks and small windows, dappled by dark lichen. Some books called manors like this the soul of Jah Kevedisolated estates, each brightlord ruling independently. It seemed to her that those writers romanticized rural life. Had they ever actually visited one of the manors, experienced the true dullness of country life in person, or did they merely fantasize about it from the comfort of their cosmopolitan cities? Inside the house, Shallan turned up the stairs toward her quarters. Father would want her looking nice for the feast. There would be a new dress for her to wear as she sat quietly, not interrupting the discussion. Father had never said so, but she suspected he thought it a pity she had begun speaking again. Perhaps he did not wish her to be able to speak of things she'd seen. She stopped in the hallway, her mind going blank. "Shallan?" She shook herself to find Van Jushu, her fourth brother, on the steps behind her. How long had she been standing and staring at the wall? The feast would start soon! Jushu's jacket was undone and hung askew, his hair mussed, his cheeks flushed with wine. No cufflinks or belt; they had been fine pieces, each with a glowing gemstone. He'd have gambled those away. "What was Father yelling about earlier?" she asked. "Were you here?" "No," Jushu said, running his hand through his hair. "But I heard. Balat has been starting fires again. Nearly burned down the storming servants' building." Jushu pushed past her, then stumbled, grabbing the bannister to keep from falling. Father was not going to like Jushu coming to the feast like this. More yelling. "Stormscursed idiot," Jushu said as Shallan helped him right himself. "Balat is going straight crazy. I'm the only one left in this family with any sense. You were staring at the wall again, weren't you?" She didn't reply. "He'll have a new dress for you," Jushu said as she helped him toward his room. "And nothing for me but curses. Bastard. He loved Helaran, and none of us are him, so we don't matter. Helaran is never here! He betrayed Father, almost killed him. And still, he's the only one who matters. . . ." They passed Father's chambers. The heavy stumpweight door was open a crack as a maid tidied the room, allowing Shallan to see the far wall. And the glowing strongbox. It was hidden behind a painting of a storm at sea that did nothing to dim the powerful white glow. Right through the canvas, she saw the outline of the strongbox blazing like a fire. She stumbled, pulling to a stop. "What are you staring at?" Jushu demanded, holding to the bannister. "The light." "What light?" "Behind the painting." He squinted, lurching forward. "What in the Halls are you talking about, girl? It really did ruin your mind, didn't it? Watching him kill Mother?" Jushu pulled away from her, cursing softly to himself. "I'm the only one in this family who hasn't gone crazy. The only storming one . . ." Shallan stared into that light. There hid a monster. There hid Mother's soul. The betrayal of spren has brought us here. They gave their Surges to human heirs, But not to those who know them most dear, before us. 'Tis no surprise we turned away Unto the gods we spent our days And to become their molding clay, they changed us. From the Listener Song of Secrets, 40th stanza "Th'information'll cost ya twelve broams," Shallan said. "Ruby, you see. I'll check each one." Tyn laughed, tossing her head back, jetblack hair falling free around her shoulders. She sat in the driver's seat of the wagon. Where Bluth used to sit. "You call that a Bav accent?" Tyn demanded. "I've only heard them three or four times." "You sounded like you have rocks in your mouth!" "That's how they sound!" "Nah, it's more like they have pebbles in their mouths. But they talk really slow, with overemphasized sounds. Like this. 'Oi looked over the paintings that ya gave me, and they're roit nice. Roit nice indeed. Ain't never had a cloth for my backside that was so pleasant.'" "You're exaggerating that!" Shallan said, though she couldn't help laughing. "A tad," Tyn said, leaning back and sweeping her long, chullguiding reed in front of her like a Shardblade. "I don't see why knowing a Bav accent would be useful," Shallan said. "They're not a very important people." "Kid, that's why they're important." "They're important because they're unimportant," Shallan said. "All right, I know I'm bad at logic sometimes, but something about that statement seems off." Tyn smiled. She was so relaxed, so . . . free. Not at all what Shallan had expected after their first encounter. But then the woman had been playing a part. Leader of the guard. This woman Shallan was talking to now, this seemed real. "Look," Tyn said, "if you're going to fool people, you'll need to learn how to act beneath them as well as above them. You're getting the whole 'important lighteyes' thing down. I assume you've had good examples." "You could say that," Shallan replied, thinking of Jasnah. "Thing is, in a lot of situations, being an important lighteyes is useless." "Being unimportant is important. Being important is useless. Got it." Tyn eyed her, chewing on some jerky. Her sword belt hung from a peg on the side of the seat, swaying to the rhythm of the chull's gait. "You know, kid, you get kind of mouthy when you let your mask down." Shallan blushed. "I like it. I prefer people who can laugh at life." "I can guess what you're trying to teach me," Shallan said. "You're saying that a person with a Bav accent, someone who looks lowly and simple, can go places a lighteyes never could." "And can hear or do things a lighteyes never could. Accent is important. Elocute with distinction, and it often won't matter how little money you have. Wipe your nose on your arm and speak like a Bav, and sometimes people won't even glance to see if you're wearing a sword." "But my eyes are light blue," Shallan said. "I'll never pass for lowly, no matter what my voice sounds like!" Tyn fished in her trouser pocket. She had slung her coat over another peg, and so wore only the pale tan trouserstight, with high bootsand a buttoned shirt. Almost a worker's shirt, though of nicer material. "Here," Tyn said, tossing something to her. Shallan barely caught it. She blushed at her clumsiness, then held it up toward the sun: a small vial with some dark liquid inside. "Eyedrops," Tyn said. "They'll darken your eyes for a few hours." "Really?" "Not hard to find, if you have the right connections. Useful stuff." Shallan lowered the vial, suddenly feeling a chill. "Is there" "The reverse?" Tyn cut in. "Something to turn a darkeyes into a lighteyes? Not that I know of. Unless you believe the stories about Shardblades." "Makes sense," Shallan said, relaxing. "You can darken glass by painting it, but I don't think you can lighten it without melting down the whole thing." "Anyway," Tyn said, "you'll need a good backwater accent or two. Herdazian, Bavlander, something like that." "I probably have a rural Veden accent," Shallan admitted. "That won't work out here. Jah Keved is a cultured country, and your internal accents are too similar to one another for outsiders to recognize. Alethi won't hear rural from you, like a fellow Veden would. They'll just hear exotic." "You've been to a lot of places, haven't you?" Shallan asked. "I go wherever the winds take me. It's a good life, so long as you're not attached to stuff." "Stuff?" Shallan asked. "But you'repardonyou're a thief. That's all about getting more stuff!" "I take what I can get, but that just proves how transient stuff is. You'll take some things, but then you'll lose them. Just like the job I pulled down south. My team never returned from their mission; I'm half convinced they ran off without seeing me paid." She shrugged. "It happens. No need to get worked up." "What kind of job was it?" Shallan asked, blinking pointedly to take a Memory of Tyn lounging there, sweeping her reed as if conducting musicians, not a care in the world. They'd nearly died a couple of weeks back, but Tyn took it in stride. "It was a big job," Tyn said. "Important, for the kinds of people who make things change in the world. I still haven't heard back from the ones who hired us. Maybe my men didn't run off; maybe they just failed. I don't know for certain." Here, Shallan caught tension in Tyn's face. A tightening of the skin around the eyes, a distance to her gaze. She was worried about what her employers might do to her. Then it was gone, smoothed away. "Have a look," Tyn said, nodding up ahead. Shallan followed the gesture and noticed moving figures a few hills over. The landscape had slowly changed as they approached the Plains. The hills grew steeper, but the air a little warmer, and plant life was more prevalent. Stands of trees clustered in some of the valleys, where waters would flow after highstorms. The trees were squat, different from the flowing majesty of the ones she'd known in Jah Keved, but it was still nice to see something other than scrub. The grass here was fuller. It pulled smartly away from the wagons, sinking into its burrows. The rockbuds here grew large, and shalebark cropped up in patches, often with lifespren bouncing about like tiny green motes. During their days traveling they'd passed other caravans, more plentiful now that they were closer to the Shattered Plains. So Shallan wasn't surprised to see someone up ahead. The figures, however, rode horses. Who could afford animals like that? And why didn't they have an escort? There seemed to be only four of them. The caravan rolled to a stop as Macob yelled an order from the first wagon. Shallan had learned, through awful experience, just how dangerous any encounter out here could be. None were taken lightly by caravan masters. She was the authority here, but she allowed those with more experience to call stops and choose their path. "Come on," Tyn said, stopping the chull with a whack of the stick, then hopping down from the wagon and grabbing her coat and sword off their pegs. Shallan scrambled down, putting on her Jasnah face. She let herself be herself with Tyn. With the others, she needed to be a leader. Stiff, stern, but hopefully inspiring. To that end, she was pleased with the blue dress that Macob had given her. Embroidered with silver, made of the finest silk, it was a wonderful upgrade from her tattered one. They walked past where Vathah and his men marched just behind the lead wagon. The leader of the deserters shot Tyn a glare. His dislike of the woman was only more reason to respect her, despite her criminal proclivities. "Brightness Davar and I will handle this," Tyn said to Macob as they passed. "Brightness?" Macob said, standing and looking toward Shallan. "What if they are bandits?" "There are only four of them, Master Macob," Shallan said lightly. "The day I can't handle four bandits on my own is a day I deserve to be robbed." They passed the wagon, Tyn tying on her belt. "What if they are bandits?" Shallan hissed once they were out of earshot. "I thought you said you could handle four." "I was just going along with your attitude!" "That's dangerous, kid," Tyn said with a grin. "Look, bandits wouldn't let us see them, and they certainly wouldn't just sit there." The group of four men waited on the top of the hill. As Shallan drew closer, she could see that they were wearing crisp blue uniforms that looked quite genuine. At the bottom of the ravine between hills, Shallan stubbed her toe on a rockbud. She grimacedMacob had given her lighteyed shoes to match her dress. They were luxurious, and probably worth a fortune, but they were little more than slippers. "We'll wait here," Shallan said. "They can come to us." "Sounds good to me," Tyn said. Indeed, up above, the men started moving down the hillside when they noticed Shallan and Tyn were waiting for them. Two more came and followed after them on foot, men not in uniforms, but workers' clothing. Grooms? "Who are you going to be?" Tyn asked softly. ". . . Myself?" Shallan replied. "What's the fun in that?" Tyn said. "How's your Horneater?" "Horneater! I" "Too late," Tyn said as the men rode up. Shallan found horses intimidating. The large brutish things weren't docile like chulls. Horses were always stomping about, snorting. The lead rider reined in his horse with some obvious annoyance. He didn't seem in complete control of the beast. "Brightness," he said, nodding to her as he saw her eyes. Shockingly, he was darkeyed, a tall man with black Alethi hair he wore down to his shoulders. He looked over Tyn, noting the sword and the soldier's uniform, but let slip no reaction. A hard man, this one. "Her Highness," Tyn announced in a loud voice, gesturing toward Shallan, "Princess Unulukuak'kina'autu'atai! You are in the presence of royalty, darkeyes!" "A Horneater?" the man said, leaning down, inspecting Shallan's red hair. "Wearing a Vorin dress. Rock would have a fit." Tyn looked to Shallan and raised an eyebrow. I'm going to strangle you, woman, Shallan thought, then took a deep breath. "This thing," Shallan said, gesturing at her dress. "He is not what you have a princess wear? He is good for me. You will be respect!" Fortunately, her red face would fit for a Horneater. They were a passionate people. Tyn nodded to her, looking appreciative. "I'm sorry," the man said, though he didn't seem very apologetic. What was a darkeyes doing riding an animal of such value? One of the man's companions was inspecting the caravan through a spyglass. He was darkeyed too, but looked more comfortable on his mount. "Seven wagons, Kal," the man said. "Well guarded." The man, Kal, nodded. "I've been sent out to look for signs of bandits," he said to Tyn. "Has all been well with your caravan?" "We ran into some bandits three weeks ago," Tyn said, thumbing over her shoulder. "Why do you care?" "We represent the king," the man said. "And are from the personal guard of Dalinar Kholin." Oh, storms. Well, that was going to be inconvenient. "Brightlord Kholin," Kal continued, "is investigating the possibility of a wider range of control around the Shattered Plains. If you really were attacked, I would like to know the details." "If we were attacked?" Shallan asked. "You doubt our word?" "No" "I am offend!" Shallan declared, folding her arms. "You'd better watch yourself," Tyn told the men. "Her Highness does not like to be offended." "How surprising," Kal said. "Where did the attack take place? You fought it off? How many bandits were there?" Tyn filled him in on the details, which gave Shallan a chance to think. Dalinar Kholin was her future fatherinlaw, if the causal matured into a marriage. Hopefully, she wouldn't run into these particular soldiers again. I really am going to strangle you, Tyn. . . . Their leader listened to the details of the attack with a stoic air. He didn't seem like a very pleasant man. "I am sorry to hear of your losses," Kal said. "But you're only a day and a half by caravan from the Shattered Plains now. You should be safe the rest of the way." "I am curiosity," Shallan said. "These animals, they are horses? Yet you are darkeyed. This . . . Kholin trusts you well." "I do my duty," Kal said, studying her. "Where are the rest of your people? That caravan looks as if it's all Vorin. Also, you look a little spindly for a Horneater." "Did you just insult the princess's weight?" Tyn asked, aghast. Storms! She was good. She actually managed to produce angerspren with the remark. Well, nothing to do but soldier on. "I am offend!" Shallan yelled. "You have offended Her Highness again!" "Very offend!" "You'd better apologize." "No apologize!" Shallan declared. "Boots!" Kal leaned back, looking between the two of them, trying to parse what had just been said. "Boots?" he asked. "Yes," Shallan said. "I am liking your boots. You will apology with boots." "You . . . want my boots?" "Did you not hear Her Highness?" Tyn asked, arms folded. "Are soldiers of this Dalinar Kholin's army so disrespectful?" "I'm not disrespectful," Kal said. "But I'm not giving her my boots." "You insult!" Shallan declared, stepping forward, pointing at him. Stormfather, those horses were enormous! "I will tell all who are to listen! When arriving, I will say, 'Kholin is stealer of boots and taker of women's virtue!'" Kal sputtered. "Virtue!" "Yes," Shallan said; then she glanced over to Tyn. "Virtue? No, wrong word. Virture . . . No . . . Vesture. Vesture! Taker of woman's vesture! That is word I wanted." The soldier glanced to his companions, looking confused. Drat, Shallan thought. Good puns are lost on men with poor vocabulary. "Is no matter," Shallan said, throwing up her hand. "All will know what you have done in wronging me. You have laid me bare, here in this wilderness. Stripping me! Is an insult to my house and my clan. All will know that Kholin " "Oh, stop, stop," Kal said, reaching down and awkwardly pulling his boot from his foot while on horseback. His sock had a hole in the heel. "Storming woman," he muttered. He tossed the first boot down to her, then removed the other. "Your apology is accepted," Tyn said, fetching the boots. "By Damnation, it had better be," Kal said. "I'll pass along your story. Maybe we can get this storming place patrolled. Come on, men." He turned and left them without another word, perhaps fearing another Horneater diatribe. Once they were out of earshot, Shallan looked at the boots, then started laughing uncontrollably. Joyspren rose around her, like blue leaves that started at her feet then moved up in a swirl before flaring out above her as if in a blast of wind. Shallan watched them with a big smile. Those were very rare. "Ah," Tyn said with a smile. "No use denying. That was fun." "I'm still going to strangle you," Shallan said. "He knew we were playing with him. That has to be the worst Horneater impression a woman has ever done." "It was actually pretty good," Tyn said. "You overdid the words, but the accent itself was spot on. That wasn't the point, though." She handed back the boots. "What was the point?" Shallan asked as they hiked back toward the caravan. "Making a fool out of me?" "Partially," Tyn said. "That was sarcasm." "If you're going to learn to do this," Tyn said, "you have to be comfortable in situations like that. You can't be embarrassed when you pose as someone else. The more outrageous the attempt, the straighter you have to play it. The only way to get better is to practiceand in front of people who very well might catch you." "I suppose," Shallan said. "Those boots are too big for you," Tyn noted. "Though I did love the look on his face when you asked for them. 'No apologize. Boots!'" "I really need some boots," Shallan said. "I'm tired of walking around on rock barefoot or in slippers. A little padding, and these will fit." She held them up. They were rather large. "Er, maybe." She looked backward. "I hope he'll be all right without them. What if he has to fight bandits on his way back?" Tyn rolled her eyes. "We're going to have to talk about that kindheartedness of yours sometime, kid." "It's not a bad thing to be nice." "You're training to be a con artist," Tyn said. "For now, let's get back to the caravan. I want to talk you through the finer points of a Horneater accent. With that red hair of yours, you'll probably find more chances to use it than you would others." Artform for colors beyond our ken; For its grand songs we yearn. We must attract creationspren; These songs suffice 'til we learn. From the Listener Song of Revision, 279th stanza Torol Sadeas closed his eyes and rested Oathbringer on his shoulder, breathing in the sweet, moldy scent of Parshendi blood. The Thrill of battle surged within him, a blessed and beautiful strength. His own blood pumped so loudly in his ears he almost couldn't hear the battlefield shouts and groans of pain. For a moment, he reveled only in the delicious glow of the Thrill, the heady euphoria at having spent an hour engaged in the only thing that brought true joy anymore: contending for his life, and taking those of enemies lesser than himself. It faded. As always, the Thrill was fleeting once battle itself ended. It had grown less and less sweet during these raids on the Parshendi, likely because he knew deep inside that this contest was pointless. It did not stretch him, did not carry him further toward his ultimate goals of conquest. Slaughtering cremcovered savages in a Heraldsforsaken land had truly lost its savor. He sighed, lowering his Blade, opening his eyes. Amaram approached across the battlefield, stepping over corpses of men and Parshendi. His Shardplate was bloodied purple up to the elbows, and he carried a glimmering gemheart in one gauntleted hand. He kicked aside a Parshendi corpse and joined Sadeas, his own honor guard fanning out to join those of his highprince. Sadeas spared a moment of annoyance for how efficiently they moved, particularly when compared to his own men. Amaram pulled off his helm and hefted the gemheart, tossing it up and catching it. "Your maneuver here today failed, you realize?" "Failed?" Sadeas said, lifting his faceplate. Nearby, his soldiers slaughtered a pocket of fifty Parshendi who hadn't managed to get off the plateau when the rest retreated. "I think this went quite nicely." Amaram pointed. A stain had appeared on the plateaus to the west, toward the warcamps. The banners indicated that Hatham and Roion, the two highprinces who were supposed to have gone on this plateau run, had arrived togetherthey used bridges like Dalinar's, slow plodding things it had been easy to outrun. One of the advantages of the bridge crews Sadeas preferred was that they needed very little training to function. If Dalinar had thought to slow him down with his stunt of trading Oathbringer for Sadeas's bridgemen, he had been proven a fool. "We needed to get out here," Amaram said, "seize the gemheart, and return before the others arrived. Then you could have claimed that you didn't realize you weren't in the rotation today. The arrival of both other armies removes that shred of deniability." "You mistake me," Sadeas said. "You assume I still care about deniability." The last Parshendi died with enraged screams; Sadeas felt proud of that. Others said Parshendi warriors on the field never surrendered, but he'd seen them try it once, long ago, in the first year of the war. They'd laid down their weapons. He'd slaughtered them all personally, with Shardhammer and Plate, beneath the eyes of their retreating companions watching from a nearby plateau. Never again had any Parshendi denied him or his men their right to finish a battle the proper way. Sadeas waved for the vanguard to gather and escort him back to the warcamps while the rest of the army licked its wounds. Amaram joined him, crossing a bridge and passing idling bridgemen who lay on the ground and slept while better men died. "I am dutybound to join you on the battlefield, Your Highness," Amaram said as they walked, "but I want you to know that I do not approve of our actions here. We should be seeking to bridge our differences with the king and Dalinar, not trying to agitate them further." Sadeas snorted. "Don't give me that noble talk. It works fine for others, but I know you for the ruthless bastard you really are." Amaram set his jaw, eyes forward. When they reached their horses, he reached out, hand on Sadeas's arm. "Torol," he said softly, "there is so much more to the world than your squabbles. You're right about me, of course. Take that admission with the understanding that to you, above all others, I can speak the truth. Alethkar needs to be strong for what is coming." Sadeas climbed the mounting block the groom had set out. Getting onto a horse in Shardplate could be dangerous to the animal if not done correctly. Besides, he'd once had a stirrup snap on him when he stepped into it to haul himself into the saddle. He'd ended up on his backside. "Alethkar does need to be strong," Sadeas said, holding out a gauntleted hand. "So I'll make it so by force of fist and the rule of blood." Amaram reluctantly placed the gemheart there, and Sadeas gripped it, holding his reins in the other hand. "Do you ever worry?" Amaram asked. "About what you do? About what we must do?" He nodded toward a group of surgeons, carrying wounded men across the bridges. "Worry?" Sadeas said. "Why should I? It gives the wretches a chance to die in battle for something worthwhile." "You say things like that a lot these days, I've noticed," Amaram said. "You weren't like that before." "I've learned to accept the world as it is, Amaram," Sadeas said, turning his horse. "That's something very few people are willing to do. They stumble along, hoping, dreaming, pretending. That doesn't change a single storming thing in life. You have to stare the world in the eyes, in all its grimy brutality. You have to acknowledge its depravities. Live with them. It's the only way to accomplish anything meaningful." With a squeeze of the knees, Sadeas started his horse forward, leaving Amaram behind for the moment. The man would remain loyal. Sadeas and Amaram had an understanding. Even Amaram now being a Shardbearer would not change that. As Sadeas and his vanguard approached Hatham's army, he noticed a group of Parshendi on a nearby plateau, watching. Those scouts of theirs were getting bold. He sent a team of archers to go chase them off, then rode toward a figure in resplendent Shardplate at the front of Hatham's army: the highprince himself, seated upon a Ryshadium. Damnation. Those animals were far superior to any other horseflesh. How to get one? "Sadeas?" Hatham called out to him. "What have you done here?" After a quick moment of decision, Sadeas lifted his arm back and hurled the gemheart across the plateau separating them. It hit the rock near Hatham and bounced along in a roll, glowing faintly. "I was bored," Sadeas shouted back. "I thought I'd save you some trouble." Then, ignoring further questions, Sadeas continued on his way. Adolin Kholin had a duel today, and he'd decided not to miss it, just in case the youth embarrassed himself again. * * * A few hours later, Sadeas settled down into his place in the dueling arena, tugging at the stock on his neck. Insufferable thingsfashionable, but insufferable. He would never tell a soul, not even Ialai, that he secretly wished he could just go about in a simple uniform like Dalinar. He couldn't ever do that, of course. Not just because he wouldn't be seen bowing to the Codes and the king's authority, but because a military uniform was actually the wrong uniform for these days. The battles they fought for Alethkar at the moment weren't battles with sword and shield. It was important to dress the part when you had a role to play. Dalinar's military outfits proved he was lost, that he didn't understand the game he was playing. Sadeas leaned back to wait as whispers filled the arena like water in a bowl. A large attendance today. Adolin's stunt in his previous duel had drawn attention, and anything novel was of interest to the court. Sadeas's seat had a space cleared around it to give him extra room and privacy, though it was really just a simple chair built onto the stone bleachers of this pit of an arena. He hated how his body felt outside of Shardplate, and he hated more how he looked. Once, he'd turned heads as he walked. His power had filled a room; everyone had looked to him, and many had lusted when seeing him. Lusted for his power, for who he was. He was losing that. Oh, he was still powerfulperhaps more so. But the look in their eyes was different. And every way of responding to his loss of youthfulness made him look petulant. He was dying, step by step. Like every man, true, but he felt that death looming. Decades away, hopefully, but it cast a long, long shadow. The only path to immortality was through conquest. Rustling cloth announced Ialai slipping into the seat beside his. Sadeas reached out absently, resting his hand on the small of her back and scratching at that place she liked. Her name was symmetrical. A tiny bit of blasphemy from her parentssome people dared imply such holiness of their children. Sadeas liked those types. Indeed, the name was what had first intrigued him about her. "Mmmm," his wife said with a sigh. "Very nice. The duel hasn't started yet, I see." "Mere moments away, I believe." "Good. I can't stand waiting. I hear you gave away the gemheart you captured today." "Threw it at Hatham's feet and rode away, as if I didn't have a care." "Clever. I should have seen that as an option. You'll undermine Dalinar's claim that we only resist him because of our greed." Below, Adolin finally stepped out onto the field, wearing his blue Shardplate. Some of the lighteyes clapped politely. Across the way, Eranniv left his own preparatory room, his polished Plate its natural color except across the breastplate, which he'd painted a deep black. Sadeas narrowed his eyes, still scratching Ialai's back. "This duel should not even be happening," he said. "Everyone was supposed to be too afraid, or too dismissive, to accept his challenges." "Idiots," Ialai said softly. "They know, Torol, what they're supposed to do I've dropped the right hints and promises. And yet every one of them secretly wants to be the man who brings down Adolin. Duelists are not a particularly dependable lot. They are brash, hotheaded, and care too much about showing off and gaining renown." "His father's plan cannot be allowed to work," Sadeas said. "It won't." Sadeas glanced at where Dalinar had set up. Sadeas's own position was not too far awaywithin shouting distance. Dalinar didn't look at him. "I built this kingdom," Sadeas said softly. "I know how fragile it is, Ialai. It should not be so difficult to knock the thing down." That would be the only way to properly build it anew. Like reforging a weapon. You melted down the remnants of the old before you created the replacement. The duel began down below, Adolin striding across the sands toward Eranniv, who wielded old Gavilar's Blade, with its wicked design. Adolin engaged too quickly. Was the boy that eager? In the crowd, lighteyes grew quiet and darkeyes shouted, eager for another display like last time. However, this didn't devolve into a wrestling match. The two exchanged testing blows and Adolin backed away, having taken a hit on his shoulder. Sloppy, Sadeas thought. "I finally discovered the nature of that disturbance at the king's chambers two weeks ago," Ialai noted. Sadeas smiled, eyes still on the bout. "Of course you did." "Assassination attempt," she said. "Someone sabotaged the king's balcony in a crude attempt at dropping him a hundred feet to the rocks. From what I hear, it nearly worked." "Not so crude then, if it almost killed him." "Pardon, Torol, but almost is a big distinction in assassinations." True. Sadeas searched within himself, seeking some sign of emotion at hearing that Elhokar had almost died. He found none beside a faint sense of pity. He was fond of the boy, but to rebuild Alethkar, all vestiges of former rule would need to be removed. Elhokar would need to die. Preferably in a quiet manner, after Dalinar had been dealt with. Sadeas expected he'd have to cut the boy's throat himself, out of respect for old Gavilar. "Who commissioned the assassins, do you suppose?" Sadeas asked, speaking softly enough thatwith the buffer his guards kept around their seatshe didn't have to worry about being overheard. "Hard to tell," Ialai replied, scooting to the side and twisting to get him to scratch a different part of her back. "It wouldn't be Ruthar or Aladar." Both were solidly in Sadeas's palm. Aladar with some resignation, Ruthar eagerly. Roion was too much a coward, others too careful. Who else could have done it? "Thanadal," Sadeas guessed. "He's the most likely. But I will see what I can discover." "It might be the same ones as with the king's armor," Sadeas said. "Perhaps we could find out more if I exercise my authority." Sadeas was Highprince of Informationone of the old designations, from previous centuries, which split duties in the kingdom among highprinces. It technically gave Sadeas authority over investigations and policing. "Perhaps," Ialai said hesitantly. "But?" She shook her head, watching another exchange of the duelists down below. This bout of fighting left Adolin with Stormlight streaming from one gauntlet, to the booing of some of the darkeyes. Why were those people even allowed in? There were lighteyes who were unable to attend because Elhokar reserved seating for their inferiors. "Dalinar," Ialai said, "has responded to our ploy of making you Highprince of Information. He used it as precedent for making himself Highprince of War. And so now, every step you take invoking your rights as Highprince of Information cements his authority over this conflict." Sadeas nodded. "You have a plan, then?" "Not quite yet," Ialai said. "But I'm forming one. You've noticed how he started up patrols outside of the camps? And in the Outer Market. Should that be your duty?" "No, that's the job of a Highprince of Commerce, which the king hasn't appointed. However, I should have authority over policing all ten camps, and appointing judges and magistrates. He should have involved me the moment an attempt was made on the king's life. But he didn't." Sadeas chewed on the thought for a moment, removing his hand from Ialai's back, letting her sit up straight. "There is a weakness here we can exploit," Sadeas said. "Dalinar has always had a problem giving up authority. He never really trusts anyone to do their job. He didn't come to me when he should have. This weakens his claims that all parts of the kingdom should work together. It's a chink in his armor. Can you ram a dagger in it?" Ialai nodded. She'd use her informants to start questions in court: Why, if Dalinar was trying to forge a better Alethkar, was he unwilling to give up any power? Why hadn't he involved Sadeas in the king's protection? Why wouldn't he open his doors to Sadeas's judges? What authority did the Throne have, really, if it made assignments like the one to Sadeas, only to pretend they hadn't been given? "You should renounce your appointment as Highprince of Information in protest," Ialai said. "No. Not yet. We wait until the rumors have nipped at old Dalinar, made him decide he needs to let me do my job. Then, the moment before he tries to involve me, I renounce." It would widen the cracks that way, both in Dalinar, and in the kingdom itself. Adolin's bout continued below. He certainly didn't look like his heart was in it. He kept leaving himself open, taking hits. This was the youth who had bragged about his skill so often? He was good, of course, but not nearly that good. Not as good as Sadeas had himself seen when the boy had been on the battlefield fighting the . . . He was faking. Sadeas found himself grinning. "Now that's almost clever," he said softly. "What?" Ialai asked. "Adolin is fighting beneath his capacity," Sadeas explained as the youth got a hitbarelyon Eranniv's helm. "He's reluctant to display his real skill, as he fears it will scare others away from dueling him. If he looks barely capable enough to win this fight, others might decide to pounce." Ialai narrowed her eyes, watching the fight. "Are you sure? Couldn't he just be having an off day?" "I'm sure," Sadeas said. Now that he knew what to watch for, he could easily read it in Adolin's specific moves, the way he teased Eranniv to attack him, then barely fended off the blows. Adolin Kholin was cleverer than Sadeas had given him credit for. Better at dueling as well. It took skill to win a boutbut it took true mastery to win while making it look the whole time that you were behind. As the fight progressed, the crowd got into it, and Adolin made it a close contest. Sadeas doubted many others would see what he did. When Adolin, moving lethargically and leaking Light from a dozen hitsall carefully allowed on different sections of Plate, so none shattered and exposed him to real dangermanaged to bring down Eranniv with a "lucky" blow at the end, the crowd roared in appreciation. Even the lighteyes seemed drawn in. Eranniv stormed off, shouting about Adolin's luck, but Sadeas found himself quite impressed. There might be a future for this boy, he thought. More so than his father, at least. "Another Shard won," Ialai said with dissatisfaction as Adolin raised a hand and walked off the field. "I'll redouble my efforts to make certain this doesn't happen again." Sadeas tapped his finger against the side of his seat. "What was it you said about duelists? That they're brash? Hotheaded?" "Yes. And?" "Adolin is both of those things and more," Sadeas said softly, considering. "He can be goaded, pushed around, brought to anger. He has passion like his father, but he controls it less securely." Can I get him right up to the cliff's edge, Sadeas thought, then shove him off? "Stop discouraging people from fighting him," Sadeas said. "Don't encourage them to fight him, either. Step back. I want to see how this develops." "That sounds dangerous," Ialai said. "That boy is a weapon, Torol." "True," Sadeas said, standing, "but you are rarely cut by a weapon if you are the one holding its hilt." He helped his wife to her feet. "I also want you to tell Ruthar's wife that he can ride with me next time I decide to strike out on my own for a gemheart. Ruthar is eager. He can be of use to us." She nodded, walking toward the exit. Sadeas followed, but hesitated, casting a glance toward Dalinar. How would this be if the man weren't trapped in the past? If he'd been willing to see the real world, rather than imagining it? You'd probably have ended up killing him then too, Sadeas admitted to himself. Don't try to pretend otherwise. Best to be honest, at the very least, with oneself. 'Tis said it was warm in the land far away When Voidbringers entered our songs. We brought them home to stay And then those homes became their own, It happened gradually. And years ahead 'twil still be said 'tis how it has to be. From the Listener Song of Histories, 12th stanza Shallan gasped at the sudden flare of color. It disrupted the landscape like breaking lightning in an otherwise clear sky. Shallan set down her spheresTyn was having her practice palming themand stood up in the wagon, steadying herself with her freehand on the back of her seat. Yes, it was unmistakable. Brilliant red and yellow on an otherwise dull canvas of brown and green. "Tyn," Shallan said. "What's that?" The other woman lounged with feet out, a widebrimmed white hat tipped over her eyes despite the fact that she was supposed to be driving. Shallan wore Bluth's hat, which she'd recovered from his things, to keep the sun off. Tyn turned to the side, lifting her hat. "Huh?" "Right there!" Shallan said. "The color." Tyn squinted. "I don't see anything." How could she miss that color, so vibrant when compared to the rolling hills full of rockbuds, reeds, and patches of grass? Shallan took the woman's spyglass and raised it to look more closely. "Plants," Shallan said. "There's a rock overhang there, sheltering them from the east." "Oh, is that all?" Tyn settled back, closing her eyes. "Thought it might be a caravan tent or something." "Tyn, it's plants." "So?" "Divergent flora in an otherwise uniform ecosystem!" Shallan exclaimed. "We're going! I'll go tell Macob to steer the caravan that way." "Kid, you're kind of strange," Tyn said as Shallan yelled at the other wagons to stop. Macob was reluctant to agree to the detour, but fortunately he accepted her authority. The caravan was about a day out from the Shattered Plains. They'd been taking it easy. Shallan struggled to contain her excitement. So much out here in the Frostlands was uniformly dull; something new to draw was exciting beyond normal reason. They approached the ridge, which had caused a high shelf of rock at exactly the right angle to form a windbreak. Larger versions of these formations were called laits. Sheltered valleys where a town could flourish. Well, this wasn't nearly so large, but life had still found it. A grove of short, bonewhite trees grew here. They had vivid red leaves. Vines of numerous varieties draped the rock wall itself, and the ground teemed with rockbuds, a variety that remained open even when there wasn't rain, blossoms drooping with heavy petals from the inside, along with tonguelike tendrils that moved like worms, seeking water. A small pond reflected the blue sky, feeding the rockbuds and trees. The leafy shade in turn gave shelter to a bright green moss. The beauty was like veins of ruby and emerald in a drab stone. Shallan hopped down the moment the wagons pulled up. She frightened something in the underbrush, and a few very small, feral axehounds burst away. She wasn't sure of the breedshe honestly wasn't even sure they were axehounds, they moved so quickly. Well, she thought, walking into the tiny lait, that probably means I don't have to worry about anything larger. A predator like a whitespine would have frightened away smaller life. Shallan walked forward with a smile. It was almost like a garden, though the plants were obviously wild rather than cultivated. They moved quickly to retract blooms, feelers, and leaves, opening a patch around her. She stifled a sneeze and pushed through to find a dark green pond. Here, she set down a blanket on a boulder, then settled herself to sketch. Others from the caravan went scouting through the lait or around the top of the rock wall. Shallan breathed in the wonderful humidity as the plants relaxed. Rockbud petals stretching out, timid leaves unfolding. Color swelled around her like nature blushing. Stormfather! She hadn't realized how much she'd missed the variety of beautiful plants. She opened her sketchbook and drew out a quick prayer in the name of Shalash, Herald of Beauty, Shallan's namesake. The plants retracted again as someone moved through them. Gaz stumbled past a group of rockbuds, cursing as he tried not to step on their vines. He came up to her, then hesitated, looking down at the pool. "Storms!" he said. "Are those fish?" "Eels," Shallan guessed as something rippled the green surface of the pool. "Bright orange ones, it appears. We had some like them back in my father's ornamental garden." Gaz leaned down, trying to get a good look, until one of the eels broke the surface with a flipping tail, spraying him with water. Shallan laughed, taking a Memory of the oneeyed man peering into those verdant depths, lips pursed, wiping his forehead. "What do you want, Gaz?" "Well," he said, shuffling. "I was wondering . . ." He glanced at the sketchpad. Shallan flipped to a new page in the pad. "Of course. Like the one I did for Glurv, I assume?" Gaz coughed into his hand. "Yeah. That one looked right nice." Shallan smiled, then started sketching. "Do you need me to pose or something?" Gaz asked. "Sure," she said, mostly to keep him busy while she drew. She tidied up his uniform, smoothing out his paunch, taking liberties with his chin. Most of the difference, however, had to do with the expression. Looking up, into the distance. With the right expression, that eye patch became noble, that scarred face became wise, that uniform became a mark of pride. She filled it in with some light background details reminiscent of that night beside the fires, when the people of the caravan had thanked Gaz and the others for their rescue. She removed the sheet from the pad, then turned it toward him. Gaz took it reverently, running his hand through his hair. "Storms," he whispered. "Is that really what I looked like?" "Yes," Shallan said. She could faintly feel Pattern as he vibrated softly nearby. A lie . . . but also a truth. That was certainly how the people Gaz saved had viewed him. "Thank you, Brightness," Gaz said. "I . . . Thank you." Ash's eyes! He actually seemed to be tearing up. "Keep it safe," Shallan said, "and don't fold it until tonight. I'll lacquer it so it won't smudge." He nodded and walked, frightening the plants again as he retreated. He was the sixth of the men to ask her for a likeness. She encouraged the requests. Anything to remind them of what they could, and should, be. And you, Shallan? she thought. Everyone seems to want you to be something. Jasnah, Tyn, your father . . . What do you want to be? She flipped back through her sketchbook, finding the pages where she'd drawn herself in a halfdozen different situations. A scholar, a woman of the court, an artist. Which did she want to be? Could she be them all? Pattern hummed. Shallan glanced to the side, noticing Vathah lurking in the trees nearby. The tall mercenary leader hadn't said anything of the sketches, but she saw his sneers. "Stop frightening my plants, Vathah," Shallan said. "Macob says we'll stop for the night," Vathah replied, then moved away. "Trouble . . ." Pattern buzzed. "Yes, trouble." "I know," Shallan said, waiting as the foliage returned, then sketching it. Unfortunately, though she'd been able to get charcoal and lacquer from the merchants, she didn't have any colored chalks, or she might have tried something more ambitious. Still, this would be a nice series of studies. Quite a change from the rest in this sketchbook. She pointedly did not think about what she had lost. She drew and drew, enjoying the simple peace of the small thicket. Lifespren joined her, the little green motes bobbing between leaves and blossoms. Pattern moved out onto the water and, amusingly, began quietly counting the leaves on a nearby tree. Shallan got a good halfdozen drawings of the pond and trees, hoping she'd be able to identify those from a book later on. She made sure to do some closeup views showing the leaves in detail, then moved on to drawing whatever struck her. It was so nice to not be moving on a wagon while sketching. The environment here was just perfectsufficient light for drawing, still and serene, surrounded by life . . . She paused, noticing what she'd drawn: a rocky shore near the ocean, with distinctive cliffs rising behind. The perspective was distant; on the rocky shore, several shadowy figures helped one another out of the water. She swore one of them was Yalb. A hopeful fancy. She wished so much for them to be alive. She would probably never know. She turned the page and drew what came to her. A sketch of a woman kneeling over a body, raising a hammer and chisel, as if to slam it down into the person's face. The one beneath her was stiff, wooden . . . maybe even stone? Shallan shook her head as she lowered her pencil and studied this drawing. Why had she drawn it? The first one made senseshe was worried about Yalb and the other sailors. But what did it say about her subconscious that she'd drawn this strange depiction? She looked up, realizing that shadows had grown long, the sun easing down to rest on the horizon. Shallan smiled at it, then jumped as she saw someone standing not ten paces away. "Tyn!" Shallan said, raising her safehand to her breast. "Stormfather! You gave me a fright." The woman picked her way through the foliage, which shied away from her. "Those drawings are nice, but I think you should spend more time practicing to forge signatures. You're a natural at that, and it's a kind of work you could do without having to worry about getting into trouble." "I do practice it," Shallan said. "But I need to practice my art too." "You get really into those drawings, don't you?" "I don't get into them," Shallan said, "I put others into them." Tyn grinned, reaching Shallan's stone. "Always fast with a quip. I like that. I need to introduce you to some friends of mine once we reach the Shattered Plains. They'll spoil you right quick." "That doesn't sound very pleasant." "Nonsense," Tyn said, hopping up onto a dry part of the next rock over. "You'd still be yourself. Your jokes would merely be dirtier." "Lovely," Shallan said, blushing. She thought the blush might make Tyn laugh, but instead the woman became thoughtful. "We are going to have to figure out a way to give you a taste of realism, Shallan." "Oh? Does it come in the form of a tonic these days?" "No," Tyn said, "it comes in the form of a punch to the face. It leaves nice girls crying, assuming they're lucky enough to survive." "I think you'll find," Shallan said, "that my life hasn't been one of nonstop blossoms and cake." "I'm sure you think that," Tyn said. "Everyone does. Shallan, I like you, I really do. I think you've got heaps of potential. But what you're training for . . . it will require you to do very difficult things. Things that wrench the soul, rip it apart. You're going to be in situations that you've never been in before." "You barely know me," Shallan said. "How can you be so certain I've never done things like this?" "Because you aren't broken," Tyn said, expression distant. "Perhaps I'm faking." "Kid," Tyn said, "you draw pictures of criminals to turn them into heroes. You dance around in flower patches with a sketchpad, and you blush at the mere hint of something racy. However bad you think you've had it, brace yourself. It's going to get worse. And I honestly don't know that you'll be able to handle it." "Why are you telling me this?" Shallan asked. "Because in a little over a day's time, we're going to reach the Shattered Plains. This is the last chance for you to back out." "I . . ." What was she going to do about Tyn when she arrived? Admit that she had only gone along with Tyn's assumptions in order to learn from her? She knows people, Shallan thought. People in the warcamps who might be very useful to know. Should Shallan continue with the subterfuge? She wanted to, though part of her knew it was because she liked Tyn, and didn't want to give the woman a reason to stop teaching her. "I am committed," Shallan found herself saying. "I want to go through with my plan." A lie. Tyn sighed, then nodded. "All right. Are you ready to tell me what this grand scam is?" "Dalinar Kholin," Shallan said. "His son is betrothed to a woman from Jah Keved." Tyn raised an eyebrow. "Now that's curious. And the woman isn't going to arrive?" "Not when he expects," Shallan said. "And you look like her?" "You could say that." Tyn smiled. "Nice. You had me thinking it would be blackmail, which is very tough. This, though, this is a scam you might actually be able to do. I'm impressed. It's bold, but attainable." "Thank you." "So what's your plan?" Tyn said. "Well, I'll go introduce myself to Kholin, indicate I'm the woman his son is to marry, and let him set me up in his household." "No good." "No?" feeling, like a storm in her veins. Liquid awesomeness. The pain faded from her chest as she healed. Wyndle ran around her in a circle, a little lasso of vines sprouting leaves on the floor, looping her again and again. Darkness stepped up close. Go! She leaped to her hands and knees. He seized her by the shoulder, but she could escape that. She summoned her awesomeness. Darkness thrust something toward her. The little animal was like a cremling, but with wings. Bound wings, tiedup legs. It had a strange little face, not crabbish like a cremling. More like a tiny axehound, with a snout, mouth, and eyes. It seemed sickly, and its shimmering eyes were pained. How could she tell that? The creature sucked the awesomeness from Lift. She actually saw it go, a glistening whiteness that streamed from her to the little animal. It opened its mouth, drinking it in. Suddenly, Lift felt very tired and very, very hungry. Darkness handed the animal to one of his minions, who made it vanish into a black sack he then tucked in his pocket. Lift was certain that the viziers standing in an outraged cluster at the tablehadn't seen any of this, not with Darkness's back to them and the two minions crowding around. "Keep all spheres from her," Darkness said. "She must not be allowed to Invest." Lift felt terror, panicked in a way she hadn't known for years, ever since her days in Rall Elorim. She struggled, thrashing, biting at the hand that held her. Darkness didn't even grunt. He hauled her to her feet, and another minion took her by the arms, wrenching them backward until she gasped at the pain. No. She'd freed herself! She couldn't be taken like this. Wyndle continued to spin around her on the ground, distressed. He was a good type, for a Voidbringer. Darkness turned to the viziers. "I will trouble you no further." "Mistress!" Wyndle said. "Here!" The halfeaten roll lay on the floor. She'd dropped it when the cudgel hit. Wyndle ran into it, but he couldn't do anything more than make it wobble. Lift thrashed, trying to pull free, but without that storm inside of her, she was just a child in the grip of a trained soldier. "I am highly disturbed by the nature of this incursion, constable," the lead vizier said, shuffling through the stack of papers that Darkness had dropped. "Your paperwork is in order, and I see you even included a pleagranted by the arbitersto search the palace itself for this urchin. Surely you did not need to disturb a holy conclave. For a common thief, no less." "Justice waits upon no man or woman," Darkness said, completely calm. "And this thief is anything but common. With your leave, we will cease disturbing you." He didn't seem to care if they gave him leave or not. He strode toward the door, and his minion pulled Lift along after. She got her foot out to the roll, but only managed to kick it forward, under the long table by the viziers. "This is a leave of execution," the vizier said with surprise, holding up the last sheet in the stack. "You will kill the child? For mere thievery?" Kill? No. No! "That, in addition to trespassing in the Prime's palace," Darkness said, reaching the door. "And for interrupting a holy conclave in session." The vizier met his gaze. She held it, then wilted. "I . . ." she said. "Ah, of course . . . er . . . constable." Darkness turned from her and pulled open the door. The vizier set one hand on the table and raised her other hand to her head. The minion dragged Lift up to the door. "Mistress!" Wyndle said, twisting up nearby. "Oh . . . oh dear. There is something very wrong with that man! He is not right, not right at all. You must use your powers." "Trying," Lift said, grunting. "You've let yourself grow too thin," Wyndle said. "Not good. You always use up the excess. . . . Low body fat . . . That might be the problem. I don't know how this works!" Darkness hesitated beside the door and looked at the lowhanging chandeliers in the hallway beyond, with their mirrors and sparkling gemstones. He raised his hand and gestured. The minion not holding Lift moved out into the hallway and found the chandelier ropes. He unwound those and pulled, raising the chandeliers. Lift tried to summon her awesomeness. Just a little more. She just needed a little. Her body felt exhausted. Drained. She really had been overdoing it. She struggled, increasingly panicked. Increasingly desperate. In the hallway, the minion tied off the chandeliers high in the air. Nearby, the vizier leader glanced from Darkness to Lift. "Please," Lift mouthed. The vizier pointedly shoved the table. It clipped the elbow of the minion holding Lift. He cursed, letting go with that hand. Lift dove for the floor, ripping out of his grip. She squirmed forward, getting underneath the table. The minion seized her by the ankles. "What was that?" Darkness asked, his voice cold, emotionless. "I slipped," the vizier said. "Watch yourself." "Is that a threat, constable? I am beyond your reach." "Nobody is beyond my reach." Still no emotion. Lift thrashed underneath the table, kicking at the minion. He cursed softly and hauled Lift out by her legs, then pulled her to her feet. Darkness watched, face emotionless. She met his gaze, eye to eye, a halfeaten roll in her mouth. She stared him down, chewing quickly and swallowing. For once, he showed an emotion. Bafflement. "All that," he said, "for a roll?" Lift said nothing. Come on . . . They walked her down the hallway, then around the corner. One of the minions ran ahead and purposefully removed the spheres from the lamps on the walls. Were they robbing the place? No, after she passed, the minion ran back and restored the spheres. Come on . . . They passed a palace guard in the larger hallway beyond. He noted something about Darknessperhaps that rope tied around his upper arm, which was threaded with an Azish sequence of colorsand saluted. "Constable, sir? You found another one?" Darkness stopped, looking as the guard opened the door beside him. Inside, Gawx sat on a chair, slumped between two other guards. "So you did have accomplices!" shouted one of the guards in the room. He slapped Gawx across the face. Wyndle gasped from just behind her. "That was certainly uncalled for!" Come on . . . "This one is not your concern," Darkness said to the guards, waiting as one of his minions did the strange gemstonemoving sequence. Why did they worry about that? Something stirred inside of Lift. Like the little swirls of wind at the advent of a storm. Darkness looked at her with a sharp motion. "Something is" Awesomeness returned. Lift became Slick, every part of her but her feet and the palms of her hands. She yanked her armit slipped from the minion's fingersthen kicked herself forward and fell to her knees, sliding under Darkness's hand as he reached for her. Wyndle let out a whoop, zipping along beside her as she began slapping the floor like she was swimming, using each swing of her arms to push herself forward. She skimmed the floor of the palace hallway, knees sliding across it as if it were greased. The posture wasn't particularly dignified. Dignity was for rich folk who had time to make up games to play with one another. She got going real fast real quickso fast it was hard to control herself as she relaxed her awesomeness and tried to leap to her feet. She crashed into the wall at the end of the hallway instead, a sprawling heap of limbs. She came out of it with a grin. That had gone way better than the last few times she'd tried this. Her first attempt had been super embarrassing. She'd been so Slick, she hadn't even been able to stay on her knees. "Lift!" Wyndle said. "Behind." She glanced down the hallway. She could swear he was glowing faintly, and he was certainly running too quickly. Darkness was awesome too. "That is not fair!" Lift shouted, scrambling to her feet and dashing down a side hallwaythe way she'd come when sneaking with Gawx. Her body had already started to feel tired again. One roll didn't get it far. She sprinted down the lavish hallway, causing a maid to jump back, shrieking as if she'd seen a rat. Lift skidded around a corner, dashed toward the nice scents, and burst into the kitchens. She ran through the mess of people inside. The door slammed open behind her a second later. Darkness. Ignoring startled cooks, Lift leaped up onto a long counter, Slicking her leg and riding on it sideways, knocking off bowls and pans, causing a clatter. She came down off the other end of the counter as Darkness shoved his way past cooks in a clump, his Shardblade held up high. He didn't curse in annoyance. A fellow should curse. Made people feel real when they did that. But of course, Darkness wasn't a real person. Of that, though little else, she was sure. Lift snatched a sausage off a steaming plate, then pushed into the servant hallways. She chewed as she ran, Wyndle growing along the wall beside her, leaving a streak of dark green vines. "Where are we going?" he asked. "Away." The door into the servant hallways slammed open behind her. Lift turned a corner, surprising an equerry. She went awesome, and threw herself to the side, easily slipping past him in the narrow hallway. "What has become of me?" Wyndle asked. "Thieving in the night, chased by abominations. I was a gardener. A wonderful gardener! Cryptics and honorspren alike came to see the crystals I grew from the minds of your world. Now this. What have I become?" "A whiner," Lift said, puffing. "Nonsense." "So you were always one of those, then?" She looked over her shoulder. Darkness casually shoved down the equerry, barely breaking stride as he charged over the man. Lift reached a doorway and slammed her shoulder against it, scrambling out into the rich hallways again. She needed an exit. A window. Her flight had just looped her around back near the Prime's quarters. She picked a direction by instinct and started running, but one of Darkness's minions appeared around a corner that way. He also carried a Shardblade. Some starvin' luck, she had. Lift turned the other way and passed by Darkness striding out of the servant hallways. She barely dodged a swing of his Blade by diving, Slicking herself, and sliding along the floor. She made it to her feet without stumbling this time. That was something, at least. "Who are these men?" Wyndle asked from beside her. Lift grunted. "Why do they care so much about you? There's something about those weapons they carry . . ." "Shardblades," Lift said. "Worth a whole kingdom. Built to kill Voidbringers." And they had two of the things. Crazy. Built to kill Voidbringers . . . "You!" she said, still running. "They're after you!" "What? Of course they aren't!" "They are. Don't worry. You're mine. I won't lettem have you." "That's endearingly loyal," Wyndle said. "And not a little insulting. But they are not after" The second of Darkness's minions stepped out into the hallway ahead of her. He held Gawx. He had a knife to the young man's throat. Lift stumbled to a halt. Gawx, in far over his head, whimpered in the man's hands. "Don't move," the minion said, "or I will kill him." "Starvin' bastard," Lift said. She spat to the side. "That's dirty." Darkness thumped up behind her, the other minion joining him. They penned her in. The entrance to the Prime's quarters was actually just ahead, and the viziers and scions had flooded out into the hallway, where they jabbered to one another in outraged tones. Gawx was crying. Poor fool. Well. This sorta thing never ended well. Lift went with her gutwhich was basically what she always didand called the minion's bluff by dashing forward. He was a lawman type. Wouldn't kill a captive in cold The minion slit Gawx's throat. Crimson blood poured out and stained Gawx's clothing. The minion dropped him, then stumbled back, as if startled by what he'd done. Lift froze. He couldn't He didn't Darkness grabbed her from behind. "That was poorly done," Darkness said to the minion, tone emotionless. Lift barely heard him. So much blood. "You will be punished." "But . . ." the minion said. "I had to do as I threatened . . ." "You have not done the proper paperwork in this kingdom to kill that child," Darkness said. "Aren't we above their laws?" Darkness actually let go of her, striding over to slap the minion across the face. "Without the law, there is nothing. You will subject yourself to their rules, and accept the dictates of justice. It is all we have, the only sure thing in this world." Lift stared at the dying boy, who held his hands to his neck, as if to stop the blood flow. Those tears . . . The other minion came up behind her. "Run!" Wyndle said. She started. "Run!" Lift ran. She passed Darkness and pushed through the viziers, who gasped and yelled at the death. She barreled into the Prime's quarters, slid across the table, snatched another roll off the platter, and burst into the bedroom. She was out the window a second later. "Up," she said to Wyndle, then stuffed the roll in her mouth. He streaked up the side of the wall, and Lift climbed, sweating. A second later, one of the minions leaped out the window beneath her. He didn't look up. He charged out onto the grounds, twisting about, searching, his Shardblade flashing in the darkness as it reflected starlight. Lift safely reached the upper reaches of the palace, hidden in the shadows there. She squatted down, hands around her knees, feeling cold. "You barely knew him," Wyndle said. "Yet you mourn." She nodded. "You've seen much death," Wyndle said. "I know it. Aren't you accustomed to it?" She shook her head. Below, the minion moved off, hunting farther and farther for her. She was free. Climb across the roof, slip down on the other side, disappear. Was that motion on the wall at the edge of the grounds? Yes, those moving shadows were men. The other thieves were climbing their wall and disappearing into the night. Huqin had left his nephew, as expected. Who would cry for Gawx? Nobody. He'd be forgotten, abandoned. Lift released her legs and crawled across the curved bulb of the roof toward the window she'd entered earlier. Her vines from the seeds, unlike the ones Wyndle grew, were still alive. They'd overgrown the window, leaves quivering in the wind. Run, her instincts said. Go. "You spoke of something earlier," she whispered. "Re . . ." "Regrowth," he said. "Each bond grants power over two Surges. You can influence how things grow." "Can I use this to help Gawx?" "If you were better trained? Yes. As it stands, I doubt it. You aren't very strong, aren't very practiced. And he might be dead already." She touched one of the vines. "Why do you care?" Wyndle asked again. He sounded curious. Not a challenge. An attempt to understand. "Because someone has to." For once, Lift ignored what her gut was telling her and, instead, climbed through the window. She crossed the room in a dash. Out into the upstairs hallway. Onto the steps. She soared down them, leaping most of the distance. Through a doorway. Turn left. Down the hallway. Left again. A crowd in the rich corridor. Lift reached them, then wiggled through. She didn't need her awesomeness for that. She'd been slipping through cracks in crowds since she started walking. Gawx lay in a pool of blood that had darkened the fine carpet. The viziers and guards surrounded him, speaking in hushed tones. Lift crawled up to him. His body was still warm, but the blood seemed to have stopped flowing. His eyes were closed. "Too late?" she whispered. "I don't know," Wyndle said, curling up beside her. "What do I do?" "I . . . I'm not sure. Mistress, the transition to your side was difficult and left holes in my memory, even with the precautions my people took. I . . ." She set Gawx on his back, face toward the sky. He wasn't really anything to her, that was true. They'd barely just met, and he'd been a fool. She'd told him to go back. But this was who she was, who she had to be. I will remember those who have been forgotten. Lift leaned forward, touched her forehead to his, and breathed out. A shimmering something left her lips, a little cloud of glowing light. It hung in front of Gawx's lips. Come on . . . It stirred, then drew in through his mouth. A hand took Lift by the shoulder, pulling her away from Gawx. She sagged, suddenly exhausted. Real exhausted, so much so that even standing was difficult. Darkness pulled her by the shoulder away from the crowd. "Come," he said. Gawx stirred. The viziers gasped, their attention turning toward the youth as he groaned, then sat up. "It appears that you are an Edgedancer," Darkness said, steering her down the corridor as the crowd moved in around Gawx, chattering. She stumbled, but he held her upright. "I had wondered which of the two you would be." "Miracle!" one vizier said. "Yaezir has spoken!" said one of the scions. "Edgedancer," Lift said. "I don't know what that is." "They were once a glorious order," Darkness said, walking her down the hallway. Everyone ignored them, focused instead on Gawx. "Where you blunder, they were elegant things of beauty. They could ride the thinnest rope at speed, dance across rooftops, move through a battlefield like a ribbon on the wind." "That sounds . . . amazing." "Yes. It is unfortunate they were always so concerned with smallminded things, while ignoring those of greater import. It appears you share their temperament. You have become one of them." "I didn't mean to," Lift said. "I realize this." "Why . . . why do you hunt me?" "In the name of justice." "There are tons of people who do wrong things," she said. She had to force out every word. Talking was hard. Thinking was hard. So tired. "You . . . you coulda hunted big crime bosses, murderers. You chose me instead. Why?" "Others may be detestable, but they do not dabble in arts that could return Desolation to this world." His words were so cold. "What you are must be stopped." Lift felt numb. She tried to summon her awesomeness, but she'd used it all up. And then some, probably. Darkness turned her and pushed her against the wall. She couldn't stand, and slumped down, sitting. Wyndle moved up beside her, spreading out a starburst of creeping vines. Darkness knelt next to her. He held out his hand. "I saved him," Lift said. "I did something good, didn't I?" "Goodness is irrelevant," Darkness said. His Shardblade dropped into his fingers. "You don't even care, do you?" "No," he said. "I don't." "You should," she said, exhausted. "You should . . . should try it, I mean. I wanted to be like you, once. Didn't work out. Wasn't . . . even like being alive . . ." Darkness raised his Blade. Lift closed her eyes. "She is pardoned!" Darkness's grip on her shoulder tightened. Feeling completely drainedlike somebody had held her up by the toes and squeezed everything out of herLift forced her eyes to open. Gawx stumbled to a stop beside them, breathing heavily. Behind, the viziers and scions moved up as well. Clothing bloodied, his eyes wide, Gawx clutched a piece of paper in his hand. He thrust this at Darkness. "I pardon this girl. Release her, constable!" "Who are you," Darkness said, "to do such a thing?" "I am the Prime Aqasix," Gawx declared. "Ruler of Azir!" "Ridiculous." "The Kadasixes have spoken," said one of the scions. "The Heralds?" Darkness said. "They have done no such thing. You are mistaken." "We have voted," said a vizier. "This young man's application was the best." "What application?" Darkness said. "He is a thief!" "He performed the miracle of Regrowth," said one of the older scions. "He was dead and he returned. What better application could we ask for?" "A sign has been given," said the lead vizier. "We have a Prime who can survive the attacks of the One All White. Praise to Yaezir, Kadasix of Kings, may he lead in wisdom. This youth is Prime. He has been Prime always. We have only now realized it, and beg his forgiveness for not seeing the truth sooner." "As it always has been done," the elderly scion said. "As it will be done again. Stand down, constable. You have been given an order." Darkness studied Lift. She smiled tiredly. Show the starvin' man some teeth. That was the right of it. His Shardblade vanished to mist. He'd been bested, but he didn't seem to care. Not a curse, not even a tightening of the eyes. He stood up and pulled on his gloves by the cuffs, first one, then the other. "Praise Yaezir," he said. "Herald of Kings. May he lead in wisdom. If he ever stops drooling." Darkness bowed to the new Prime, then left with a sure step. "Does anyone know the name of that constable?" one of the viziers asked. "When did we start letting officers of the law requisition Shardblades?" Gawx knelt beside Lift. "So you're an emperor or something now," she said, closing her eyes, settling back. "Yeah. I'm still confused. It seems I performed a miracle or something." "Good for you," Lift said. "Can I eat your dinner?" SzethsonsonVallano, Truthless of Shinovar, sat atop the highest tower in the world and contemplated the End of All Things. The souls of the people he had murdered lurked in the shadows. They whispered to him. If he drew close, they screamed. They also screamed when he shut his eyes. He had taken to blinking as little as possible. His eyes felt dry in his skull. It was what any . . . sane man would do. The highest tower in the world, hidden in the tops of the mountains, was perfect for his contemplation. If he had not been bound to an Oathstone, if he had been another man entirely, he would have stayed here. The only place in the East where the stones were not cursed, where walking on them was allowed. This place was holy. Bright sunlight shone down to banish the shadows, which kept those screams to a minimum. The screamers deserved their deaths, of course. They should have killed Szeth. I hate you. I hate . . . everyone. Glories within, what a strange emotion. He did not look up. He would not meet the gaze of the God of Gods. But it was good to be in the sunlight. There were no clouds here to bring the darkness. This place was above them all. Urithiru ruled even the clouds. The massive tower was also empty; that was another reason he liked it. A hundred levels, built in ring shapes, each one beneath larger than the one above it to provide a sunlit balcony. The eastern side, however, was a sheer, flat edge that made the tower look from a distance as if that side had been sliced off by an enormous Shardblade. What a strange shape. He sat on that edge, right at the top, feet swinging over a drop of a hundred massive stories and a plummet down the mountainside below. Glass sparkled on the smooth surface of the flat side there. Glass windows. Facing east, toward the Origin. The first time he had visited this placejust after being exiled from his homelandhe hadn't understood just how odd those windows were. Back then, he'd still been accustomed to gentle highstorms. Rain, wind, and meditation. Things were different in these cursed lands of the stonewalkers. These hateful lands. These lands flowing with blood, death, and screams. And . . . And . . . Breathe. He forced the air in and out and stood up on the rim of the parapet atop the tower. He had fought an impossibility. A man with Stormlight, a man who knew the storm within. That meant . . . problems. Years ago, Szeth had been banished for raising the alarm. The false alarm, it had been said. The Voidbringers are no more, they had told him. The spirits of the stones themselves promised it. The powers of old are no more. The Knights Radiant are fallen. We are all that remains. All that remains. . . . Truthless. "Have I not been faithful?" Szeth shouted, finally looking up to face the sun. His voice echoed against the mountains and their spiritsouls. "Have I not obeyed, kept my oath? Have I not done as you demanded of me?" The killing, the murder. He blinked tired eyes. SCREAMS. "What does it mean if the Shamanate are wrong? What does it mean if they banished me in error?" It meant the End of All Things. The end of truth. It would mean that nothing made sense, and that his oath was meaningless. It would mean he had killed for no reason. He dropped off the side of the tower, white clothingnow a symbol to him of many thingsflapping in the wind. He filled himself with Stormlight and Lashed himself southward. His body lurched in that direction, falling across the sky. He could only travel this way for a short time; his Stormlight did not last long. Too imperfect a body. The Knights Radiant . . . they'd been said . . . they'd been said to be better at this . . . like the Voidbringers. He had just enough Light to free himself from the mountains and land in a village in the foothills. They often set out spheres for him there as an offering, considering him some kind of god. He would feed upon that Light, and it would let him go a farther distance until he found another city and more Stormlight. It would take days to get where he was going, but he would find answers. Or, barring that, someone to kill. Of his own choice, this time. Eshonai waved her hand as she climbed the central spire of Narak, trying to shoo away the tiny spren. It danced around her head, shedding rings of light from its cometlike form. Horrid thing. Why would it not leave her alone? Perhaps it could not stay away. She was experiencing something wonderfully new, after all. Something that had not been seen in centuries. Stormform. A form of true power. A form given of the gods. She continued up the steps, feet clinking in her Shardplate. It felt good on her. She had held this form for fifteen days now, fifteen days of hearing new rhythms. At first, she had attuned those often, but this had made some people very nervous. She had backed off, and forced herself to attune the old, familiar ones when speaking. It was difficult, for those old rhythms were so dull. Buried within those new rhythms, the names of which she intuited somehow, she could almost hear voices speaking to her. Advising her. If her people had received such guidance over the centuries, they surely would not have fallen so far. Eshonai reached the top of the spire, where the other four awaited her. Again, her sister Venli was also there, and she wore the new form as wellwith its spiking armor plates, its red eyes, its lithe danger. This meeting would proceed very differently from the previous one. Eshonai cycled through the new rhythms, careful not to hum them. The others weren't ready yet. She sat down, then gasped. That rhythm! It sounded like . . . like her own voice yelling at her. Screaming in pain. What was that? She shook her head, and found that she had reflexively pulled her hand to her chest in anxiety. When she opened it, the cometlike spren shot out. She attuned Irritation. The others of the Five regarded her with heads cocked, a couple humming to Curiosity. Why did she act as she did? Eshonai settled herself, Shardplate grinding against stone. This close to the lullthe time called the Weeping by the humanshighstorms were growing more rare. That had created a small impediment in her march to see every listener given stormform. There had only been one storm since Eshonai's own transformation, and during it, Venli and her scholars had taken stormform along with two hundred soldiers chosen by Eshonai. Not officers. Common soldiers. The type she was sure would obey. The next highstorm was mere days away, and Venli had been gathering her spren. They had thousands ready. It was time. Eshonai regarded the others of the Five. Today's clear sky rained down white sunlight, and a few windspren approached on a breeze. They stopped when they grew near, then zipped away in the opposite direction. "Why have you called this meeting?" Eshonai asked the others. "You've been speaking of a plan," Davim said, broad worker's hands clasped before him. "You've been telling everyone of it. Shouldn't you have brought it to the Five first?" "I'm sorry," Eshonai said. "I am merely excited. I believe, however, we should now be the Six." "That has not been decided," Abronai said, weak and plump. Mateform was disgusting. "This moves too quickly." "We must move quickly," Eshonai replied to Resolve. "We have only two highstorms before the lull. You know what the spies report. The humans are planning a final push toward us, toward Narak." "It is a pity," Abronai said to Consideration, "that your meeting with them went so poorly." "They wanted to tell me of the destruction they planned to bring," Eshonai lied. "They wanted to gloat. That was the only reason they met with me." "We need to be ready to fight them," Davim said to Anxiety. Eshonai laughed. A blatant use of emotion, but she truly felt it. "Fight them? Haven't you been listening? I can summon a highstorm." "With help," Chivi said to Curiosity. Nimbleform. Another weak form. They should expunge that one from their ranks. "You have said you cannot do it alone. How many others would you need? Certainly the two hundred you have now are enough." "No, that is not nearly enough," Eshonai replied. "I feel that the more people we have in this form, the more likely we are to succeed. I would like, therefore, to move that we transform." "Yes," Chivi said. "But how many of us?" "All of us." Davim hummed to Amusement, thinking it must be a joke. He trailed off as the rest sat in silence. "We will have just one chance," Eshonai said to Resolve. "The humans will leave their warcamps together, in one large army that intends to reach Narak during the lull. They will be completely exposed on the plateaus, with no shelter. A highstorm at that time would destroy them." "We don't even truly know if you can summon one," Abronai said to Skepticism. "That is why we need as many of us in stormform as possible," Eshonai said. "If we miss this opportunity, our children will sing us the songs of Cursing, assuming they even live long enough to do so. This is our chance, our one chance. Imagine the ten armies of men, isolated on the plateaus, buffeted and overwhelmed by a tempest they could never have expected! With stormform, we would be immune to its effects. If any survive, we could destroy them easily." "It is tempting," Davim said. "I do not like the look of those who have taken this form," Chivi said. "I do not like how people clamor to be given it. Perhaps two hundred are enough." "Eshonai," Davim said, "how does this form feel?" He was asking more than he actually said. Each form changed a person in some ways. Warform made you more aggressive, mateform made you easy to distract, nimbleform encouraged focus, and workform made you obedient. Eshonai attuned Peace. No. That was the screaming voice. How had she spent weeks in this form and not noticed? "I feel alive," Eshonai said to Joy. "I feel strong, and I feel powerful. I feel a connection to the world that I should have always known. Davim, this is like the change from dullform to one of the other formsit is that much of an upgrade. Now that I hold this strength, I realize I wasn't fully alive before." She lifted her hand and made a fist. She could feel the energy coursing down her arm as the muscles flexed, though it was hidden beneath the Shardplate. "Red eyes," Abronai whispered. "Have we come to this?" "If we decide to do this," Chivi said. "Perhaps we four should assess it first, then say if the others should join us." Venli opened her mouth to speak, but Chivi waved her hand, interrupting her. "You have had your say, Venli. We know what you wish." "We cannot wait, unfortunately," Eshonai said. "If we want to trap the Alethi armies, we will need time to transform everyone before the Alethi leave to search for Narak." "I'm willing to try it," Abronai said. "Perhaps we should propose a mass transformation to our people." "No." Zuln spoke to Peace. The dullform member of the Five sat slouched, looking at the ground before her. She almost never said anything. Eshonai attuned Annoyance. "What was that?" "No," Zuln repeated. "It is not right." "I would have us all be in agreement," Davim said. "Zuln, can you not listen to reason?" "It is not right," the dullform said again. "She is dull," Eshonai said. "We should ignore her." Davim hummed to Anxiety. "Zuln represents the past, Eshonai. You shouldn't say such things of her." "The past is dead." Abronai joined Davim in humming to Anxiety. "Perhaps this is worth more thought. Eshonai, you . . . do not speak as you used to. I hadn't realized the changes were so stark." Eshonai attuned one of the new rhythms, the Rhythm of Fury. She held the song inside, and found herself humming. These were so cautious, so weak! They would see her people destroyed. "We will meet again later today," Davim said. "Let us spend time considering. Eshonai, I would speak with you alone during that period, if you are willing." "Of course." They rose from their places atop the pillar. Eshonai stepped to the edge and looked down as the others filed down. The spire was too high to jump from, even in Shardplate. She so wanted to try. It seemed that every person in the city had gathered around the base to await the decision. In the weeks since Eshonai's transformation, talk of what had happened to herthen the othershad infused the city with a certain mixture of anxiety and hope. Many had come to her, begging to be given the form. They saw the chance it offered. "They're not going to agree to it," Venli said from behind once the others were down. She spoke to Spite, one of the new rhythms. "You spoke too aggressively, Eshonai." "Davim is with us," Eshonai said to Confidence. "Chivi will come too, with persuasion." "That isn't enough. If the Five do not come to a consensus" "Don't worry." "Our people must take that form, Eshonai," Venli said. "It is inevitable." Eshonai found herself attuning the new version of Amusement . . . Ridicule, it was. She turned to her sister. "You knew, didn't you? You knew exactly what this form would do to me. You knew this before you took the form yourself." "I . . . Yes." Eshonai grabbed her sister by the front of her robe, then yanked her forward, holding her tightly. With Shardplate it was easy, though Venli resisted more than she should have been able to, and a small spark of red lightning ran across the woman's arms and face. Eshonai was not accustomed to such strength from her scholar of a sister. "You could have destroyed us," Eshonai said. "What if this form had done something terrible?" Screaming. In her head. Venli smiled. "How did you discover this?" Eshonai asked. "It didn't come from the songs. There is more." Venli did not speak. She met Eshonai's eyes and hummed to Confidence. "We must make certain the Five agree to this plan," she said. "If we are to survive, and if we are to defeat the humans, we must be in this formall of us. We must summon that storm. It has been . . . waiting, Eshonai. Waiting and building." "I will see to it," Eshonai said, dropping Venli. "You can gather enough spren for us to transform all of our people?" "My staff have been working on it these three weeks. We will be ready to transform thousands upon thousands over the course of the final two highstorms before the lull." "Good." Eshonai started down the steps. "Sister?" Venli asked. "You are planning something. What is it? How will you persuade the Five?" Eshonai continued down the steps. With the added balance and strength of Shardplate, she didn't need to bother with the chains to steady herself. As she neared the bottom, where the others of the Five were speaking to the people, she stopped a short distance above the crowd and drew in a deep breath. Then, as loudly as she could, Eshonai shouted, "In two days, I will take any who wish to go into the storm and give them this new form." The crowd stilled, their humming dropping off. "The Five seek to deny you this right," Eshonai bellowed. "They don't want you to have this form of power. They are frightened, like cremlings hiding in cracks. They cannot deny you! It is the right of every person to choose their own form." She raised her hands above her head, humming to Resolve, and summoned a storm. A tiny one, a mere trickle compared to what waited. It grew between her hands, a wind coursing with lightning. A miniature tempest in her palms, light and power, wind spinning in a vortex. It had been centuries since this power had been used, and solike a river that had been dammedthe energy waited impatiently to be freed. The tempest grew so that it whipped at her clothing, spinning around her in a swirl of wind, crackling red lightning, and dark mist. Finally, it dissipated. She heard Awe being sung throughout the crowdfull songs, not humming. Their emotions were strong. "With this power," Eshonai declared, "we can destroy the Alethi and protect our people. I have seen your despair. I have heard you sing to Mourning. It need not be so! Come with me into the storms. It is your right, your duty, to join with me." Behind her on the steps, Venli hummed to Tension. "This will divide us, Eshonai. Too aggressive, too abrupt!" "It will work," Eshonai said to Confidence. "You do not know them as I do." Below, the other members of the Five were glaring up at her, looking betrayed, though she could not hear their songs. Eshonai marched to the bottom of the spire, then pushed her way through the crowd, being joined by her soldiers in stormform. The people made way for her, many humming to Anxiety. Most who had come were workers or nimbleforms. That made sense. The warforms were too pragmatic for gawking. Eshonai and her stormform warriors left the town's center ring. She allowed Venli to tag along behind, but paid the woman no heed. Eshonai eventually approached the barracks on the leeward side of the city, a large group of buildings built together to form a community for the soldiers. Though her troops were not required to sleep here, many did so. The practice grounds one plateau over were busy with the sounds of warriors honing their skills, ormore likelynewly transformed soldiers being trained. The second division, a hundred and twentyeight in number, were away watching for humans entering the middle plateaus. Scouts in warpairs roamed the Plains. She'd set them on this task soon after obtaining her form, as she had known even then that she would need to change the way this battle worked. She wanted every bit of information about the Alethi and their current tactics that she could get. Her soldiers would ignore chrysalises for the time being. She would not lose soldiers to that petty game any longer, not when each man and woman under her command represented the potential of stormform. The other divisions were all here, however. Seventeen thousand soldiers total. A mighty force in some ways, but also so few, compared to what they had once been. She raised her hand in a fist, and her stormform division raised the call for all soldiers in the listener army to gather. Those practicing set down their weapons and jogged over. Others left the barracks. In a short time, all had joined her. "It is time to end the fight against the Alethi," Eshonai announced in a loud voice. "Which of you are willing to follow me in doing so?" Humming to Resolve moved through the crowd. So far as she could hear, not a one hummed to Skepticism. Excellent. "This will require each soldier to join me in this form," Eshonai shouted, her words being relayed through the ranks. More humming to Resolve. "I am proud of you," Eshonai said. "I am going to have the Storm Division go among you and take your word, each of you, on this transformation. If there are any here who do not wish to change, I would know of it personally. It is your decision, by right, and I will not force youbut I must know." She looked to her stormforms, who saluted and broke apart, moving in warpairs. Eshonai stepped back, folding her arms, watching as these visited each other division in turn. The new rhythms thrummed in her skull, though she stayed away from the Rhythm of Peace, with its strange screams. There was no fighting against what she had become. The eyes of the gods were too strongly upon her. Nearby, some soldiers gathered, familiar faces beneath hardened skullplates, the men bearing bits of gemstone tied to their beards. Her own division, once her friends. She could not quite explain why she had not chosen them at first for the transformation, instead picking two hundred soldiers from across many divisions. She'd needed soldiers who were obedient, but not known for their brightness. Thude and the soldiers of Eshonai's former division . . . they knew her too well. They would have questioned. Soon, she had gotten word. Of her seventeen thousand troops, only a handful refused the required transformation. Those who had declined were gathered on the practice grounds. As she contemplated her next move, Thude approached. Tall and thicklimbed, he had always worn warform save for two weeks as a mate to Bila. He hummed to Resolvethe way for a soldier to indicate a willingness to obey orders. "I am worried about this, Eshonai," he said. "Do so many need to change?" "If we do not transform," Eshonai said, "we are dead. The humans will ruin us." He continued to hum to Resolve, to indicate he trusted her. His eyes seemed to tell another story. Melu, of her stormforms, returned and saluted. "The counting is finished, sir." "Excellent," Eshonai said. "Pass word to the troops. We're going to do the same thing for everyone in the city." "Everyone?" Thude said to Anxiety. "Our time is short," Eshonai said. "If we do not act, we will miss our opportunity to move against the humans. We have two storms left; I want every willing person in this city ready to take up stormform before those have passed us. Those who will not are given that right, but I want them gathered so we may know where we stand." "Yes, General," Melu said. "Use a tight scouting formation," Eshonai said, pointing toward parts of the city. "Move through the streets, counting every person. Use the nonstormform divisions too, for speed. Tell the common people that we're trying to determine how many soldiers we will have for the coming battle, and have our soldiers be calm and sing to Peace. Put those people who are willing to transform into the central ring. Send those who are unwilling out here. Give them an escort so that they do not get lost." Venli stepped up to her as Melu passed the word, sending ranks out to obey. Thude rejoined his division. Every half year, they did an accounting to determine their numbers and see if the forms were properly balanced. Once in a while, they would need more volunteers to become mates or workers. Most often, they needed more warforms. That meant this exercise was familiar to the soldiers, and they took easily to the orders. After years of war, they were accustomed to doing as she said. Many had the same depression that the regular people expressedonly for the troops, it manifested as bloodlust. They just wanted to fight. They would probably have charged headon against the human encampments, and ten times their own numbers, if Eshonai ordered. The Five all but handed this to me, she thought as the first of the unwilling began to trickle out of the city, guarded by her soldiers. For years I've been absolute leader of our armies, and every person among us with a hint of aggression has been given to me as a soldier. Workers would obey; it was their nature. Many of the nimbles who hadn't transformed yet were loyal to Venli, as the majority of them aspired to be scholars. The mates wouldn't care, and the few dulls would be too numb of brain to object. The city was hers. "We'll have to kill them, unfortunately," Venli said, watching the unwilling be gathered. They huddled together, afraid, despite the soft songs of the soldiers. "Will your troops be able to do it?" "No," Eshonai said, shaking her head. "Many would resist us if we did this now. We will have to wait for all of my soldiers to be transformed. They will not object then." "That's sloppy," Venli said to Spite. "I thought you commanded their loyalty." "Do not question me," Eshonai said. "I control this city, not you." Venli quieted, though her humming to Spite continued. She would attempt to seize control from Eshonai. It was an uncomfortable realization, as was the realization of how deeply Eshonai herself wanted to be in control. That didn't feel like her. Not at all. None of this feels like me. I . . . The new rhythms' beats surged in her mind. She turned from such thoughts as a group of soldiers approached, towing a shouting figure. Abronai, of the Five. She should have realized that he'd be trouble; he maintained mateform too easily, avoiding its distractions. Transforming him would have been dangerous, she thought. He has too much control over himself. As the stormform soldiers pulled him to Eshonai, his shouts beat against her. "This is outrageous! The dictates of the Five rule us, not the will of a single person! Can't you see that the form, the new form is overriding her! You've all lost your minds! Or . . . or worse." It was discomfortingly close to the truth. "Put him with the others," Eshonai said, gesturing toward the group of dissidents. "What of the rest of the Five?" "They agreed," Melu said. "Some were reluctant, but they agreed." "Go and fetch Zuln. Put her with the dissenters. I don't trust her to do what is needed." The soldier didn't question as she towed Abronai away. There were perhaps a thousand dissenters there on the large plateau that made up the practice grounds. An acceptably small number. "Eshonai . . ." The song was sung to Anxiety. She turned as Thude approached. "I don't like this, what we're doing here." Bother. She had worried that he would be difficult. She took him by the arm, leading him a ways off. The new rhythms cycled through her mind as her armored feet crunched on the stones. Once they were far enough away from Venli and the others for some privacy, she turned Thude to look him in the eyes. "Out with it," she said to Irritation, picking one of the old, familiar rhythms for him. "Eshonai," he said quietly. "This isn't right. You know it's not right. I agreed to changeevery soldier didbut it's not right." "Do you disagree that we needed new tactics in this war?" Eshonai said to Resolve. "We were dying slowly, Thude." "We did need new tactics," Thude said. "But this . . . Something's wrong with you, Eshonai." "No, I just needed an excuse for such extreme action. Thude, I've been considering something like this for months." "A coup?" "Not a coup. A refocusing. We are doomed if we don't change our methods! My only hope was Venli's research. The only thing she turned up was this form. Well, I've got to try and use it, make one last attempt to save our people. The Five tried to stop me. I've heard you yourself complain about how much they talk instead of acting." He hummed to Consideration. She knew him well enough, however, to sense when he was forcing a rhythm. The beat was too obvious, too strong. I almost convinced him, she thought. It's the red eyes. I've instilled in him, and some of the others of my own division, too much of a fear of our gods. It was a shame, but she'd probably have to see him, and her other former friends, executed. "I see you're not convinced," Eshonai said. "I just . . . I don't know, Eshonai. This seems bad." "I'll talk you through it later," Eshonai said. "I don't have time right now." "And what are you going to do to those?" Thude asked, nodding toward the dissenters. "This looks an awful lot like a roundup of people who don't agree with you. Eshonai . . . did you realize your own mother was among them?" She started, looking and seeing her aging mother being guided to the group by two stormforms. They hadn't even come to her with the question. Did that mean they were extra obedient, following her orders no matter what, or were they worried she would weaken because her mother refused to change? She could hear her mother singing. One of the old songs, as she was guided. "You can watch over that group," Eshonai said to Thude. "You and soldiers you trust. I'll put my own division in charge of the people there, you at their head. That way, nothing will happen to them without your agreement." He hesitated, then nodded, humming to Consideration for real this time. She let him go and he jogged over to Bila and a few others of Eshonai's former division. Poor, trusting Thude, she thought as he took command of guarding the dissenters. Thank you for rounding yourself up so neatly. "This was handled well," Venli said as Eshonai walked back to her. "Can you control the city long enough for the transformation?" "Easily," Eshonai said, nodding to the soldiers who came to give her a report. "Just make certain you can deliver the proper spren and in the proper quantities." "I will," Venli said to Satisfaction. Eshonai took the reports. Everyone who had agreed was gathered in the center of the city. It was time to speak to them and deliver the lies she'd prepared. That the Five would be reinstated once the humans were dealt with, that there was no reason to worry. That everything was just fine. Eshonai strode into a city that was now hers, flanked by soldiers in the new form. She summoned her Blade for effect, the last one her people owned, resting it on her shoulder. She made her way to the center of the city, passing melted buildings and shacks built from carapace. It was a wonder that those things survived the storms. Her people deserved better. With the return of the gods, they would have better. Irritatingly, it took some time to get the people ready for her speech. Some twenty thousand nonwarforms gathered together was quite a sight; looking upon them, the city's population did not seem nearly so small. Still, this was a fraction of their original numbers. Her soldiers seated them all, prepared messengers to deliver her words to those not near enough to hear. As she waited for the preparations, she listened to reports regarding the population. Surprisingly, the majority of those who had dissented were workers. They were supposed to be obedient. Well, the greater number of them were elderly, the ones who had not fought in the war against the Alethi. Those who had not been forced to watch their friends be killed. She waited by the base of the pillar until everything was ready. She climbed the steps to begin her speech, but stopped as she noticed Varanis, one of her lieutenants, running toward her. He was one she had chosen for stormform. Suddenly alert, Eshonai attuned the Rhythm of Destruction. "General," he said to Anxiety. "They've escaped!" "Who?" "The ones you had us set apart, the ones who did not want to transform. They've fled." "Well, chase them down," Eshonai said to Spite. "They can't get far. The workers won't be able to jump chasms; they can only go as far as the bridges allow." "General! They cut down one of the bridges, then used the ropes to climb down into the chasm itself. They've fled through those." "Then they're dead anyway," Eshonai said. "There is a storm in two days. They'll be caught in the chasms and killed. Ignore them." "What of their guards?" Venli demanded to Spite, shoving her way up beside Eshonai. "Why weren't they being watched?" "The guards went with them," Varanis said. "Eshonai, Thude was leading those" "No matter," Eshonai said. "You are dismissed." Varanis retreated. "You aren't surprised," Venli said to Destruction. "Who are these guards that are willing to help their prisoners escape? What have you done, Eshonai?" "Do not challenge me." "I" "Do not challenge me," Eshonai said, grabbing her sister by the neck with a gauntleted hand. "Kill me, and you'll ruin everything," Venli said, not a hint of fear in her voice. "They'll never follow a woman who murdered her own sister in public, and only I can provide the spren you need for this transformation." Eshonai hummed to the Rhythm of Derision, but let go. "I'm going to make my speech." She turned her back on Venli and stepped up to address the people. I'll address this letter to my "old friend," as I have no idea what name you're using currently. Kaladin had never been in prison before. Cages, yes. Pits. Pens. Under guard in a room. Never a proper prison. Perhaps that was because prisons were too nice. He had two blankets, a pillow, and a chamber pot that was changed regularly. They fed him far better than he'd ever been fed as a slave. The stone shelf wasn't the most comfortable bed, but with the blankets, it wasn't too bad. He didn't have any windows, but at least he wasn't out in the storms. All in all, the room was very nice. And he hated it. In the past, the only times he'd been stuck in a small space had been to weather a highstorm. Now, being enclosed here for hours on end, with nothing to do but lie on his back and think . . . Now he found himself restless, sweating, missing the open spaces. Missing the wind. The solitude didn't bother him. Those walls, though. They felt like they were crushing him. On the third day of his imprisonment, he heard a disturbance from farther inside the prison, beyond his chamber. He stood up, ignoring Syl, who sat on an invisible bench on his wall. What was that shouting? It echoed in from the hallway. His little cell was in its own room. The only people he'd seen since being locked up were the guards and the servants. Spheres glowed on the walls, keeping the place well lit. Spheres in a room meant for criminals. Were they there to taunt the men locked away? Riches just beyond reach. He pressed against the cold bars, listening to the indistinct shouts. He imagined Bridge Four having come to break him out. Stormfather send they didn't try something so foolish. He eyed one of the spheres in its setting on the wall. "What?" Syl asked him. "I might be able to get close enough to suck that Light out. It's only a little farther than the Parshendi were when I drew the Light from their gemstones." "Then what?" Syl asked, voice small. Good question. "Would you help me break out, if I wanted to?" "Do you want to?" "I'm not sure." He turned around, still standing, and rested his back against the bars. "I might need to. Breaking out would be against the law, though." She lifted her chin. "I'm no highspren. Laws don't matter; what's right matters." "On that point, we agree." "But you came willingly," Syl said. "Why would you leave now?" "I won't let them execute me." "They're not going to," Syl said. "You heard Dalinar." "Dalinar can go rot. He let this happen." "He tried to" "He let it happen!" Kaladin snapped, turning and slamming his hands against the bars. Another storming cage. He was right back where he'd begun! "He's the same as the others," Kaladin growled. Syl zipped over to him, coming to rest between the bars, hands on hips. "Say that again." "He . . ." Kaladin turned away. Lying to her was hard. "All right, fine. He's not. But the king is. Admit it, Syl. Elhokar is a terrible king. At first he lauded me for trying to protect him. Now, at the snap of his fingers, he's willing to execute me. He's a child." "Kaladin, you're scaring me." "Am I? You told me to trust you, Syl. When I jumped down into the arena, you said this time things would be different. How is this different?" She looked away, seeming suddenly very small. "Even Dalinar admitted that the king had made a big mistake in letting Sadeas wiggle out of the challenge," Kaladin said. "Moash and his friends are right. This kingdom would be better off without Elhokar." Syl dropped to the floor, head bowed. Kaladin walked back to his bench, but was too stirred up to sit. He found himself pacing. How could a man be expected to live trapped in a little room, without fresh air to breathe? He wouldn't let them leave him here. You'd better keep your word, Dalinar. Get me out. Soon. The disturbance, whatever it had been, quieted. Kaladin asked the servant about it when she came with his food, pushing it through the small opening at the bottom of the bars. She wouldn't speak to him, and scurried off like a cremling before a storm. Kaladin sighed, retrieving the foodsteamed vegetables, dribbled with a salty black sauceand flopping back on his bench. They gave him food he could eat with his fingers. No forks or knives for him, just in case. "Nice place you have here, bridgeboy," Wit said. "I considered moving in here myself on several occasions. The rent might be cheap, but the price of admission is quite steep." Kaladin scrambled up to his feet. Wit sat on a bench by the far wall, outside the cell and under the spheres, tuning some kind of strange instrument on his lap made of taut strings and polished wood. He hadn't been there a moment ago. Storms . . . had the bench even been there before? "How did you get in?" Kaladin asked. "Well, there are these things called doors . . ." "The guards let you?" "Technically?" Wit asked, plucking at a string, then leaning down to listen as he plucked another. "Yes." Kaladin sat back down on the bench in his cell. Wit wore his blackonblack, his thin silver sword undone from his waist and sitting on the bench beside him. A brown sack slumped there as well. Wit leaned down to tune his instrument, one leg crossed over the other. He hummed softly to himself and nodded. "Perfect pitch," Wit said, "makes this all so much easier than it once was. . . ." Kaladin sat, waiting, as Wit settled back against the wall. Then did nothing. "Well?" Kaladin asked. "Yes. Thank you." "Are you going to play music for me?" "No. You wouldn't appreciate it." "Then why are you here?" "I like visiting people in prison. I can say whatever I want to them, and they can't do anything about it." He looked up at Kaladin, then rested his hands on his instrument, smiling. "I've come for a story." "What story?" "The one you're going to tell me." "Bah," Kaladin said, lying back down on his bench. "I'm in no mood for your games today, Wit." Wit plucked a note on his instrument. "Everyone always says thatwhich, first off, makes it a cliche. I am led to wonder. Is anyone ever in the mood for my games? And if they are, would that not defeat the point of my type of game in the first place?" Kaladin sighed as Wit continued to pluck out notes. "If I play along today," Kaladin asked, "will that get rid of you?" "I will leave as soon as the story is done." "Fine. A man went to jail. He hated it there. The end." "Ah . . ." Wit said. "So it's a story about a child, then." "No, it's about" Kaladin cut off. Me. "Perhaps a story for a child," Wit said. "I will tell you one, to get you in the mood. A bunny rabbit and a chick went frolicking in the grass together on a sunny day." "A chick . . . baby chicken?" Kaladin said. "And a what?" "Ah, forgot myself for a moment," Wit said. "Sorry. Let me make it more appropriate for you. A piece of wet slime and a disgusting crab thing with seventeen legs slunk across the rocks together on an insufferably rainy day. Is that better?" "I suppose. Is the story over?" "It hasn't started yet." Wit abruptly slapped the strings, then began to play them with ferocious intent. A vibrant, energetic repetition. One punctuated note, then seven in a row, frenzied. The rhythm got inside of Kaladin. It seemed to shake the entire room. "What do you see?" Wit demanded. "I . . ." "Close your eyes, idiot!" Kaladin closed his eyes. This is stupid. "What do you see?" Wit repeated. Wit was playing with him. The man was said to do that. He was supposedly Sigzil's old mentor. Shouldn't Kaladin have earned a reprieve by helping out his apprentice? There was nothing of humor to those notes. Those powerful notes. Wit added a second melody, complementing the first. Was he playing that with his other hand? Both at the same time? How could one man, one instrument, produce so much music? Kaladin saw . . . in his mind . . . A race. "That's the song of a man who is running," Kaladin said. "In the driest part of the brightest day, the man set off from the eastern sea." Wit said it perfectly to the beat of his music, a chant that was almost a song. "And where he went or why he ran, the answer comes from you to me." "He ran from the storm," Kaladin said softly. "The man was Fleet, whose name you know; he's spoken of in song and lore. The fastest man e'er known to live. The surest feet e'er known to roam. In time long past, in times I've known, he raced the Herald Chanarach. He won that race, as he did each one, but now the time for defeat had come. "For Fleet so sure, and Fleet the quick, to all that heard he yelled his goal: to beat the wind, and race a storm. A claim so brash, a claim too bold. To race the wind? It can't be done. Undaunted, Fleet was set to run. So to the east, there went our Fleet. Upon the shore his mark was set. "The storm grew strong, the storm grew wild. Who was this man all set to dash? No man should tempt the God of Storms. No fool had ever been so rash." How did Wit play this music with only two hands? Surely another hand had joined him. Should Kaladin look? In his mind's eye, he saw the race. Fleet, a barefooted man. Wit claimed all knew of him, but Kaladin had never heard of such a story. Lanky, tall, with tiedback long hair that went to his waist. Fleet took his mark on the shore, leaning forward in a running posture, waiting as the stormwall thundered and crashed across the sea toward him. Kaladin jumped as Wit hit a burst of notes, signaling the race's start. Fleet tore off just in front of an angry, violent wall of water, lightning, and windblown rocks. Wit did not speak again until Kaladin prompted him. "At first," Kaladin said, "Fleet did well." "O'er rock and grass, our Fleet did run! He leaped the stones and dodged the trees, his feet a blur, his soul a sun! The storm so grand, it raged and spun, but away from it our Fleet did run! The lead was his, the wind behind, did man now prove that storms could lose? "Through land he ran so quick and sure, and Alethkar he left behind. But now the test he saw ahead, for mountains he would have to climb. The storm surged on, released a howl; it saw its chance might now approach. "To the highest mounts and the coldest peaks, our hero Fleet did make his way. The slopes were steep and paths unsure. Would he maintain his mighty lead?" "Obviously not," Kaladin said. "You can never stay ahead. Not for long." "No! The storm grew close, 'til it chewed his heels. Upon his neck, Fleet felt its chill. Its breath of ice was all around, a mouth of night and wings of frost. Its voice was of the breaking rocks; its song was of the crashing rain." Kaladin could feel it. Icy water seeping through his clothing. Wind buffeting his skin. A roar so loud that soon, he could hear nothing at all. He'd been there. He'd felt it. "Then the tip he reached! The point he found! Fleet climbed no more; he crossed the peak. And down the side, his speed returned! Outside the storm, Fleet found the sun. Azir's plains were now his path. He sprinted west, more broad his stride." "But he was growing weak," Kaladin said. "No man can run that far without getting tired. Even Fleet." "Yet soon the race its toll did claim. His feet like bricks, his legs like cloth. In gasps our runner drew his breath. The end approached, the storm outdone, but slowly did our hero run." "More mountains," Kaladin whispered. "Shinovar." "A final challenge raised its head, a final shadow to his dread. The land did rise up once again, the Misted Mountains guarding Shin. To leave the storming winds behind, our Fleet again began to climb." "The storm caught up." "The storms again came to his back, the winds again did spin around! The time was short, the ending near, as through those mounts our Fleet did dash." "It was right upon him. Even going down the other side of the mountains, he was unable to stay very far ahead." "He crossed the peaks, but lost his lead. The last paths lay before his feet, but strength he'd spent and might he'd lost. Each step was toil, each breath in pain. A sunken land he crossed with grief, the grass so dead it did not move. "But here the storm, it too did wilt, with thunder lost and lightning spent. The drops slipped down, now weak as wet. For Shin is not a place for them. "Ahead the sea, the race's end. Fleet stayed ahead, his muscles raw. Eyes barely saw, legs barely walked, but on he went to destiny. The end you know, the end will live, a shock for men to me you'll give." Music, but no words. Wit waited for Kaladin's reply. Enough of this, Kaladin thought. "He died. He didn't make it. The end." The music stopped abruptly. Kaladin opened his eyes, looking toward Wit. Would he be mad that Kaladin had made such a poor conclusion to the story? Wit stared at him, instrument still in his lap. The man didn't seem angry. "So you do know this story," Wit said. "What? I thought you were making it up." "No, you were." "Then what is there to know?" Wit smiled. "All stories told have been told before. We tell them to ourselves, as did all men who ever were. And all men who ever will be. The only things new are the names." Kaladin sat up. He tapped one finger against his stone block of a bench. "So . . . Fleet. Was he real?" "As real as I am," Wit said. "And he died?" Kaladin said. "Before he could finish the race?" "He died." Wit smiled. "What?" Wit attacked the instrument. Music ripped through the small room. Kaladin rose to his feet as the notes reached new heights. "Upon that land of dirt and soil," Wit shouted, "our hero fell and did not stir! His body spent, his strength undone, Fleet the hero was no more. "The storm approached and found him there. It stilled and stopped upon its course! The rains they fell, the winds they blew, but forward they could not progress. "For glory lit, and life alive, for goals unreached and aims to strive. All men must try, the wind did see. It is the test, it is the dream." Kaladin stepped slowly up to the bars. Even with eyes open, he could see it. Imagine it. "So in that land of dirt and soil, our hero stopped the storm itself. And while the rain came down like tears, our Fleet refused to end this race. His body dead, but not his will, within those winds his soul did rise. "It flew upon the day's last song, to win the race and claim the dawn. Past the sea and past the waves, our Fleet no longer lost his breath. Forever strong, forever fast, forever free to race the wind." Kaladin rested his hands against the bars of his cage. The music rang in the room, then slowly died. Kaladin gave it a moment, Wit looking at his instrument, a proud smile on his lips. Finally, he tucked his instrument under his arm, took his bag and sword, and walked toward the doorway out. "What does it mean?" Kaladin whispered. "It's your story. You decide." "But you already knew it." "I know most stories, but I'd never sung this one before." Wit looked back at him, smiling. "What does it mean, Kaladin of Bridge Four? Kaladin Stormblessed?" "The storm caught him," Kaladin said. "The storm catches everyone, eventually. Does it matter?" "I don't know." "Good." Wit tipped his sword up toward his forehead, as if in respect. "Then you have something to think about." He left. Have you given up on the gemstone, now that it is dead? And do you no longer hide behind the name of your old master? I am told that in your current incarnation you've taken a name that references what you presume to be one of your virtues. "Aha!" Shallan said. She scrambled across her fluffy bedsinking down practically to her neck with each motionand leaned precariously over the side. She scrabbled among the stacks of papers on the floor, tossing aside irrelevant sheets. Finally, she retrieved the one she wanted, holding it up while pushing hair out of her eyes and tucking it behind her ears. The page was a map, one of those ancient ones that Jasnah had talked about. It had taken forever to find a merchant at the Shattered Plains who had a copy. "Look," Shallan said, holding the map beside a modern one of the same area, copied by her own hand from Amaram's wall. Bastard, she noted to herself. She turned the maps around so that Patternwho decorated the wall above her headboardcould see them. "Maps," he said. "A pattern!" Shallan exclaimed. "I see no pattern." "Look right here," she said, edging over beside the wall. "On this old map, the area is . . ." "Natanatan," Pattern read, then hummed softly. "One of the Epoch Kingdoms," Shallan said. "Organized by the Heralds themselves for divine purposes and blah blah. But look." She stabbed the page with her finger. "The capital of Natanatan, Stormseat. If you were to judge where we'd find the ruins of it, comparing this old map to the one Amaram had . . ." "It would be in those mountains somewhere," Pattern said, "between the words 'Dawn's Shadow' and the U in 'Unclaimed Hills.'" "No, no," Shallan said. "Use a little imagination! The old map is wildly inaccurate. Stormseat was right here. On the Shattered Plains." "That is not what the map says," Pattern said, humming. "Close enough." "That is not a pattern," he said, sounding offended. "Humans; you do not understand patterns. Like right now. It is second moon. Each night, you sleep during this time. But not tonight." "I can't sleep tonight." "More information, please," Pattern said. "Why not tonight? Is it the day of the week? Do you always not sleep on Jesel? Or is it the weather? Has it grown too warm? The position of the moons relative to" "It's none of that," Shallan said, shrugging. "I just can't sleep." "Your body is capable of it, surely." "Probably," Shallan said. "But not my head. It surges with too many ideas, like waves against the rocks. Rocks that . . . I guess . . . are also in my head." She cocked her head. "I don't think that metaphor makes me sound particularly bright." "But" "No more complaints," Shallan said, raising a finger. "Tonight, I am doing scholarship." She put the page down on her bed, then leaned over the side, fishing out several others. "I wasn't complaining," Pattern complained. He moved down onto the bed beside her. "I do not remember well, but did Jasnah not use a desk when . . . 'doing scholarship'?" "Desks are for boring people," Shallan said. "And for people who don't have a squishy bed." Would Dalinar's camp have had such a plush bed for her? Likely, the workload would have been smaller. Though, finally, she'd managed to finish sorting through Sebarial's personal finances and was almost ready to present him with a set of relatively neat books. In a stroke of insight, she'd slipped a copy of one of her pages of quotes about Urithiruits potential riches, and its connection to the Shattered Plainsin among the other reports she'd sent Palona. At the bottom, she wrote, "Among Jasnah Kholin's notes are these indications of something valuable hidden out on the Shattered Plains. Will keep you informed of my discoveries." If Sebarial thought there was opportunity beyond gemhearts out on the Plains, she might be able to get him to take her out there with his armies, in case Adolin's promises didn't come through. Getting all of that ready had left her with little time for studying, unfortunately. Perhaps that was why she couldn't sleep. This would be easier, Shallan thought, if Navani would agree to meet with me. She'd written again, and gotten the reply that Navani was busy caring for Dalinar, who had come down with a sickness. Nothing lifethreatening, apparently, but he had withdrawn for a few days to recuperate. Did Adolin's aunt blame her for botching the dueling agreement? After what Adolin had decided to do last week . . . Well, at least his preoccupation left Shallan with some time to read and think about Urithiru. Anything other than worrying about her brothers, who still hadn't responded to her letters pleading for them to leave Jah Keved and come to her. "I find sleeping very odd," Pattern said. "I know that all beings in the Physical Realm engage in it. Do you find it pleasant? You fear nonexistence, but is not unconsciousness the same thing?" "With sleep, it's only temporary." "Ah. It is all right, because in the morning, you each return to sentience." "Well, that depends on the person," Shallan said absently. "For many of them, 'sentience' might be too generous a term. . . ." Pattern hummed, trying to sort through to the meaning of what she said. Finally, he buzzed an approximation of a laugh. Shallan cocked an eyebrow at him. "I have guessed that what you said is humorous," Pattern said. "Though I do not know why. It was not a joke. I know of jokes. A soldier came running into camp after going to see the prostitutes. He was white in the face. His friends asked if he had found a good time. He said that he had not. They asked why. He said that when he'd asked how much the woman charged, she'd said one mark plus the tip. He told his friends that he hadn't realized they were charging body parts now." Shallan grimaced. "You heard that from Vathah's men, didn't you?" "Yes. It is funny because the word 'tip' means several different things. A payment made in addition to the sum initially charged, usually given voluntarily, and the top piece of something. In addition, I believe that 'the tip' means something in the slang of the soldiers, and so the man in the joke thought she was going to cut off his" "Yes, thank you," Shallan said. "That is a joke," Pattern continued. "I understand why it is funny. Ha ha. Sarcasm is similar. You replace an expected result with one grossly unexpected, and the humor is in the juxtaposition. But why was your earlier comment funny?" "It's debatable whether it was, at this point. . . ." "But" "Pattern, nothing is less funny than explaining humor," Shallan said. "We have more important things to discuss." "Mmm . . . Such as why you have forgotten how to make your images produce sound? You did it once, long ago." . . . Shallan blinked, then held up the modern map. "The capital of Natanatan was here, on the Shattered Plains. The old maps are misleading. Amaram notes that the Parshendi use weapons of masterly design, far beyond their skill in craftsmanship. Where would they have gotten those? From the ruins of the city that once was here." Shallan dug in her stacks of papers, getting out a map of the city itself. It didn't show the surrounding areait was just a city map, and a rather vague one, taken from a book she'd purchased. She thought it was the one that Jasnah referenced in her notes. The merchant she'd bought it from claimed it was ancientthat it was a copy of a copy from a book in Azir that claimed to be a drawing of a tile mosaic depiction of the city of Stormseat. The mosaic no longer existedso much of what they had of the shadowdays came from fragments like these. "Scholars reject the idea that Stormseat was here on the Plains," Shallan said. "They say that the craters of the warcamps don't match the descriptions of the city. Instead, they propose that the ruins must be hidden up in the highlands, where you indicated. But Jasnah didn't agree with them. She points out that few of the scholars have actually been here, and that this area in general is poorly explored." "Mmm," Pattern said. "Shallan . . ." "I agree with Jasnah," Shallan said, turning from him. "Stormseat wasn't a large city. It could have been in the middle of the Plains, and these craters something else. . . . Amaram says here he thinks they might once have been domes. I wonder if that is even possible. . . . They'd be so large. . . . Anyway, this might have been a satellite city of some sort." Shallan felt like she was getting close to something. Amaram's notes spoke mostly of trying to meet with the Parshendi, to ask them about the Voidbringers and how to return them. He did mention Urithiru, however, and seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Jasnahthat the ancient city of Stormseat would have contained a path to Urithiru. Ten of them had once connected the ten capitals of the Epoch Kingdoms to Urithiru, which had some kind of conference room for the ten monarchs of the Epoch Kingdomsand a throne for each one. That was why none of the maps placed the holy city in the same location. It was ridiculous to walk there; instead, you made for the nearest city with an Oathgate and used that. He's searching for the information there, Shallan thought. Same as I am. But he wants to return the Voidbringers, not fight them. Why? She held up the antique map of Stormseat, the copy from the mosaic. It had artistic stylings instead of specific indications of things like distance and location. While she appreciated the former, the latter was truly frustrating. Are you on here? she thought. The secret, the Oathgate? Are you here, on this dais, as Jasnah thought? "The Shattered Plains haven't always been shattered," Shallan whispered to herself. "That's what the scholars, all but Jasnah, are missing. Stormseat was destroyed during the Last Desolation, but it was so long ago, nobody talks about how. Fire? Earthquake? No. Something more terrible. The city was broken, like a piece of fine dinnerware hit with a hammer." "Shallan," Pattern said, moving closer to her. "I know that you have forgotten much of what once was. Those lies attracted me. But you cannot continue like this; you must admit the truth about me. About what I can do, and what we have done. Mmm . . . More, you must know yourself. And remember." She sat crosslegged on the toonice bed. Memories tried to claw their way out of the boxes inside her head. Those memories all pointed one way, toward carpet bloodied. And carpet . . . not. "You wish to help," Pattern said. "You wish to prepare for the Everstorm, the spren of the unnatural one. You must become something. I did not come to you merely to teach you tricks of light." "You came to learn," Shallan said, staring at her map. "That's what you said." "I came to learn. We became to do something greater." "Would you have me unable to laugh?" she demanded, suddenly holding back tears. "Would you have me crippled? That is what those memories would do to me. I can be what I am because I cut them off." An image formed in front of her, born of Stormlight, created by instinct. She hadn't needed to draw this image first, for she knew it too well. The image was of herself. Shallan, as she should be. Curled in a huddle on the bed, unable to weep for she had long since run out of tears. This girl . . . not a woman, a girl . . . flinched whenever spoken to. She expected everyone to shout at her. She could not laugh, for laughter had been squeezed from her by a childhood of darkness and pain. That was the real Shallan. She knew it as surely as she knew her own name. The person she had become instead was a lie, one she had fabricated in the name of survival. To remember herself as a child, discovering Light in the gardens, Patterns in the stonework, and dreams that became real . . . . . . "Mmmm . . . Such a deep lie," Pattern whispered. "A deep lie indeed. But still, you must obtain your abilities. Learn again, if you have to." "Very well," Shallan said. "But if we did this before, can't you just tell me how it is done?" "My memory is weak," Pattern said. "I was dumb so long, nearly dead. Mmm. I could not speak." "Yeah," Shallan said, remembering him spinning on the ground and running into the wall. "You were kind of cute, though." She banished the image of the frightened, huddled, whimpering girl, then got out her drawing implements. She tapped a pencil against her lips, then did something simple, a drawing of Veil, the darkeyed con woman. Veil was not Shallan. Her features were different enough that the two of them would be distinct individuals to anyone who happened to see them both. Still, Veil did bear echoes of Shallan. She was a darkeyed, tanskinned, Alethi version of Shallana Shallan that was a few years older and had a pointier nose and chin. Finished with the drawing, Shallan breathed out Stormlight and created the image. It stood beside the bed, arms folded, looking as confident as a master duelist facing a child with a stick. Sound. How would she do sound? Pattern had called it a force, part of the Surge of Illuminationor at least similar to it. She situated herself on the bed, one leg folded beneath her, inspecting Veil. Over the next hour, Shallan tried everything she could think of, from straining herself and concentrating, to trying to draw sounds to make them appear. Nothing worked. Finally, she climbed off the bed and walked to get herself a drink from the bottle chilling in the bucket in the next room. As she approached it, however, she felt a tugging inside of her. She looked over her shoulder into the bedroom, and saw that the image of Veil had started to blur, like smudged pencil lines. Blast, but that was inconvenient. Sustaining the illusion required Shallan to provide a constant source of Stormlight. She walked back into the bedroom and set a sphere on the floor inside of Veil's foot. When she walked away, the illusion still grew indistinct, like a bubble preparing to pop. Shallan turned and put her hands on her hips, staring at the version of Veil that had gone all fuzzy. "Annoying!" she snapped. Pattern hummed. "I'm sorry that your mystical, godlike powers do not instantly work as you would like them to." She raised an eyebrow at him. "I thought you didn't understand humor." "I do. I just explained . . ." He paused for a moment. "Was I being funny? Sarcasm. I was sarcastic. By accident!" He seemed surprised, even gleeful. "I guess you're learning." "It is the bond," he explained. "In Shadesmar, I do not communicate this way, this . . . human way. My connection to you gives me the means by which I can manifest in the Physical Realm as more than a mindless glimmer. Mmmm. It links me to you, helps me communicate as you do. Fascinating. Mmmm." He settled down like a trumping axehound, perfectly content. And then Shallan noticed something. "I'm not glowing," Shallan said. "I'm holding a lot of Stormlight, but I'm not glowing." "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. "Large illusion transforms the Surge into another. Feeds off your Stormlight." She nodded. The Stormlight she held fed the illusion, drawing the excess from her that would normally float above her skin. That could be useful. As Pattern moved up onto the bed, Veil's elbowwhich was closest to himgrew more distinct. Shallan frowned. "Pattern, move closer to the image." He obliged, crossing the cover of her bed toward where Veil stood. She unfuzzed. Not completely, but his presence made a noticeable difference. Shallan walked over, her proximity making the illusion snap back to full clarity. "Can you hold Stormlight?" Shallan asked Pattern. "I don't . . . I mean . . . Investiture is the means by which I . . ." "Here," Shallan said, pressing her hand down on him, muffling his words to an annoyed buzzing. It was an odd sensation, as if she'd trapped an angry cremling under the bedsheets. She pushed some Stormlight into him. When she lifted her hand, he was trailing wisps of it, like steam off a hotplate fabrial. "We're bonded," she said. "My illusion is your illusion. I'm going to get a drink. See if you can keep the image from breaking apart." She backed to the sitting room and smiled. Pattern, still buzzing with annoyance, moved down off the bed. She couldn't see himthe bed was in the waybut she guessed he'd gone to Veil's feet. It worked. The illusion stayed. "Ha!" Shallan said, getting herself a cup of wine. She walked back and eased onto the bedflopping down with a cup of red wine did not seem prudentand looked over the side at the floor, where Pattern sat beneath Veil. He was visible because of the Stormlight. I'll need to take that into account, Shallan thought. Build illusions so that he can hide in them. "It worked?" Pattern said. "How did you know it would work?" "I didn't." Shallan took a sip of wine. "I guessed." She drank another sip as Pattern hummed. Jasnah would not have approved. Scholarship requires a sharp mind and alert senses. These do not mix with alcohol. Shallan drank the rest of the wine in a gulp. "Here," Shallan said, reaching down. She did the next bit by instinct. She had a connection to the illusion, and she had a connection to Pattern, so . . . With a push of Stormlight, she attached the illusion to Pattern as she often attached them to herself. His glow subsided. "Walk around," she said. "I don't walk . . ." Pattern said. "You know what I mean," Shallan said. Pattern moved, and the image moved with him. It didn't walk, unfortunately. The image just kind of glided. Like light reflected onto the wall from a spoon you idly turned in your hands. She cheered to herself anyway. After so long failing to get sounds from one of her creations, this different discovery seemed a major victory. Could she get it to move more naturally? She settled down with her sketchpad and started drawing. ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO Shallan became the perfect daughter. She kept quiet, particularly in Father's presence. She spent most days in her room, sitting by the window, reading the same books over and over or sketching the same objects again and again. He had proven several times by this point that he would not touch her if she angered him. Instead, he would beat others in her name. The only times she allowed herself to drop the mask was when she was with her brothers, times when her father couldn't hear. Her three brothers often cajoled herwith an edge of desperationto tell them stories from her books. For their hearing only, she made jokes, poked fun at Father's visitors, and invented extravagant tales by the hearth. Such an insignificant way to fight back. She felt a coward for not doing more. But surely . . . surely things would get better now. Indeed, as Shallan was involved more by the ardents in accounts, she noted a shrewdness to the way her father stopped being bullied by other lighteyes and started playing them against each other. He impressed her, but frightened her, in how he seized for power. Father's fortunes changed further when a new marble deposit was discovered on his landsproviding resources to keep up with his promises, bribes, and deals. Surely that would make him start laughing again. Surely that would drive the darkness from his eyes. It did not. * * * "She is too low for you to marry," Father said, setting down his mug. "I won't have it, Balat. You will break off contact with that woman." "She belongs to a good family!" Balat said, standing, palms on the table. It was lunch, and so Shallan was expected to be here, rather than remaining shut up in her room. She sat to the side, at her private table. Balat stood facing Father across the high table. "Father, they're your vassals!" Balat snapped. "You yourself have invited them to dine with us." "My axehounds dine at my feet," Father said. "I do not allow my sons to court them. House Tavinar is not nearly ambitious enough for us. Now, Sudi Valam, that might be worth considering." Balat frowned. "The highprince's daughter? You can't be serious. She's in her fifties!" "She is single." "Because her husband died in a duel! Anyway, the highprince would never approve it." "His perception of us will change," Father said. "We are a wealthy family now, with much influence." "Yet still headed by a murderer," Balat snapped. Too far! Shallan thought. On Father's other side, Luesh laced his fingers in front of him. The new house steward had a face like a wellworn glove, leathery and wrinkled in the places most usednotably the frown lines. Father stood up slowly. This new anger of his, the cold anger, terrified Shallan. "Your new axehound pups," he said to Balat. "Terrible that they caught a sickness during the latest highstorm. Tragic. It is unfortunate they need to be put down." He gestured, and one of his new guardsa man Shallan did not know wellstepped outside, pulling his sword from its sheath. Shallan grew very cold. Even Luesh grew concerned, placing a hand on Father's arm. "You bastard," Balat said, growing pale. "I'll" "You'll what, Balat?" Father asked, shaking off Luesh's touch, leaning toward Balat. "Come on. Say it. Will you challenge me? Don't think I wouldn't kill you if you did. Wikim may be a pathetic wreck, but he will serve just as well as you for what this house needs." "Helaran is back," Balat said. Father froze, hands on the table, unmoving. "I saw him two days ago," Balat said. "He sent for me, and I rode out to meet him in the city. Helaran" "That name is not to be spoken in this house!" Father said. "I mean it, Nan Balat! Never." Balat met his father's gaze, and Shallan counted ten beats of her thumping heart before Balat broke the stare and looked away. Father sat down, looking exhausted as Balat stalked out of the room. The hall fell completely silent, Shallan too frightened to speak. Father eventually stood up, shoving his chair back and leaving. Luesh trailed soon after. That left Shallan alone with the servants. Timidly she stood up, then went after Balat. He was in the kennel. The guard had worked swiftly. Balat's new pod of pups lay dead in a pool of violet blood on the stone floor. She'd encouraged Balat to breed these. He'd been making progress with his demons, over the years. He rarely hurt anything larger than a cremling. Now he sat on a box, looking down at the small corpses, horrified. Painspren cluttered the ground near him. The metal gate into the kennel rattled as Shallan pushed it open. She raised her safehand to her mouth as she drew closer to the pitiful remains. "Father's guards," Balat said. "It's like they were waiting for a chance to do something like this. I don't like the new group he has. That Levrin, with the angry eyes, and Rin . . . that one frightens me. What ever happened to Ten and Beal? Soldiers that you could joke with. Almost friends . . ." She rested a hand on his shoulder. "Balat. Did you really see Helaran?" "Yes. He said I wasn't to tell anyone. He warned me that this time when he left, he might not be coming back for a long time. He told me . . . told me to watch over the family." Balat buried his head in his hands. "I can't be him, Shallan." "You don't need to be." "He's brave. He's strong." "He abandoned us." Balat looked up, tears running down his cheeks. "Maybe he was right. Maybe that's the only way, Shallan." "Leave our house?" "What of it?" Balat asked. "You spend every day locked away, brought out only for Father to display. Jushu has gone back to his gamblingyou know he has, even if he's smarter about it. Wikim talks about becoming an ardent, but I don't know if Father will ever let go of him. He's insurance." It was, unfortunately, a good argument. "Where would we go?" Shallan asked. "We have nothing." "I have nothing here either," Balat said. "I'm not going to give up on Eylita, Shallan. She's the only beautiful thing that has happened in my life. If she and I have to go live in Vedenar as tenth dahn, with me working as a house guard or something like that, we'll do it. Doesn't that seem a better life than this?" He gestured toward the dead pups. "Perhaps." "Would you go with me? If I took Eylita and left? You could be a scribe. Earn your own way, be free of Father." "I . . . No. I need to stay." "Why?" "Something has hold of Father, something awful. If we all leave, we give him to it. Someone has to help him." "Why do you defend him so? You know what he did." "He didn't do it." "You can't remember," Balat said. "You've told me over and over that your mind blanks. You saw him kill her, but you don't want to admit that you witnessed it. Storms, Shallan. You're as broken as Wikim and Jushu. As . . . as I am sometimes . . ." She shook off her numbness. "It doesn't matter," she said. "If you go, are you going to take Wikim and Jushu with you?" "I couldn't afford to," Balat said. "Jushu in particular. We'd have to live lean, and I couldn't trust that he'd . . . you know. But if you came, it might be easier for one of us to find work. You're better at writing and art than Eylita." "No, Balat," Shallan said, frightened of how eager a part of her was to say yes to him. "I can't. Particularly if Jushu and Wikim remain here." "I see," he said. "Maybe . . . maybe there's another way out. I'll think." She left him in the kennel, worried that Father would find her there and that it would upset him. She entered the manor, but couldn't help feeling that she was trying to hold together a carpet as dozens of people pulled out threads from the sides. What would happen if Balat left? He backed down from fights with Father, but at least he resisted. Wikim merely did what he was told, and Jushu was still a mess. We have to just weather this, Shallan thought. Stop provoking Father, let him relax. Then he'll come back. . . . She climbed the steps and passed Father's door. It was open a crack; she could hear him inside. ". . . find him in Valath," Father said. "Nan Balat claims to have met him in the city, and that is what he must have meant." "It will be done, Brightlord." That voice. It was Rin, captain of Father's new guards. Shallan backed up, peeking into the room. Father's strongbox shone behind the picture on the back wall, bright light bursting through the canvas. To her it was almost blinding, though the men in the room didn't seem able to see it. Rin bowed before Father, hand on sword. "Bring me his head, Rin," Father said. "I want to see it with my own eyes. He is the one who could ruin all of this. Surprise him, kill him before he can summon his Shardblade. That weapon will be yours in payment so long as you serve House Davar." Shallan stumbled back from the door before Father could look up and see her. Helaran. Father had just ordered Helaran's assassination. I have to do something. I have to warn him. How? Could Balat contact him again? Shallan "How dare you," said a feminine voice within. Stunned silence followed. Shallan edged back to look into the room. Malise, her stepmother, stood in the doorway between the bedroom and the sitting room. The small, plump woman had never seemed threatening to Shallan before. But the storm on her face today could have frightened a whitespine. "Your own son," Malise said. "Have you no morals left? Have you no compassion?" "He is no longer my son," Father growled. "I believed your story about the woman before me," Malise said. "I've supported you. I've lived with this cloud over the house. Now I hear this? It is one thing to beat the servants, but to kill your son?" Father whispered something to Rin. Shallan jumped, and barely got down the hallway to her room before the man slipped out of the room, then closed Father's door with a click. Shallan shut herself in her room as the shouting started, a violent, angry backandforth between Malise and her father. Shallan huddled up beside the bed, tried to use a pillow to keep out the sounds. When she thought it was over, she removed the pillow. Her father stormed out into the hallway. "Why will nobody in this house obey?" he shouted, thumping down the stairs. "This wouldn't happen if you all just obeyed." This is, I suspect, a little like a skunk naming itself for its stench. Life continued in Kaladin's cell. Though the accommodations were nice for a dungeon, he found himself wishing he were back in the slave wagon. At least then he'd been able to watch the scenery. Fresh air, wind, an occasional rinse in the highstorm's last rains. Life certainly hadn't been good, but it had been better than being locked away and forgotten. They took the spheres away at night, abandoning him to blackness. In the dark, he found himself imagining that he was someplace deep, with miles of stone above him and no pathway out, no hope of rescue. He could not conceive a worse death. Better to be gutted on the battlefield, looking up at the open sky as your life leaked away. * * * Light awoke him. He sighed, watching the ceiling as the guardslighteyed soldiers he didn't knowreplaced the lamp spheres. Day after day, everything was the storming same in here. Waking to the frail light of spheres, which only made him wish for the sun. The servant arrived to give him his breakfast. He'd placed his chamber pot in reach of the opening at the bottom of the bars, and it scraped stone as she pulled it out and replaced it with a fresh one. She scurried away. He frightened her. With a groan at stiff muscles, Kaladin sat up and regarded his meal. Flatbread stuffed with bean paste. He stood, waving away some strange spren like taut wires crossing before him, then forced himself to do a set of pushups. Keeping his strength up would be difficult if the imprisonment continued too long. Perhaps he could ask for some stones to use for training. Was this what happened to Moash's grandparents? Kaladin wondered, taking the food. Waiting for a trial until they died in prison? Kaladin sat back on his bench, nibbling on the flatbread. There'd been a highstorm yesterday, but he'd barely been able to hear it, locked away in this room. He heard Syl humming nearby, but couldn't find where she'd gone. "Syl?" he asked. She kept hiding from him. "There was a Cryptic at the fight," her voice said softly. "You mentioned those before, didn't you? A type of spren?" "A revolting type." She paused. "But not evil, I don't think." She sounded begrudging. "I was going to follow it, as it fled, but you needed me. When I went back to look, it had hidden from me." "What does it mean?" Kaladin asked, frowning. "Cryptics like to plan," Syl said slowly, as if recalling something long lost. "Yes . . . I remember. They debate and watch and never do anything. But . . ." "What?" Kaladin asked, rising. "They're looking for someone," Syl said. "I've seen the signs. Soon, you might not be alone, Kaladin." Looking for someone. To choose, like him, as a Surgebinder. What kind of Knight Radiant had been made by a group of spren Syl so obviously detested? It didn't seem like someone he'd want to get to know. Oh, storms, Kaladin thought, sitting back down. If they choose Adolin . . . The thought should have made him sick. Instead, he found Syl's revelation oddly comforting. Not being alone, even if it did turn out to be Adolin, made him feel better and drove away some small measure of his gloom. As he was finishing his meal, a thump came from the hallway. The door opening? Only lighteyes could visit him, though so far none had. Unless you counted Wit. The storm catches everyone, eventually. . . . Dalinar Kholin stepped into the room. Despite his sour thoughts, Kaladin's immediate reactiondrilled into him over the yearswas to stand and salute, hand to breast. This was his commanding officer. He felt an idiot as soon as he did it. He stood behind bars and saluted the man who'd put him here? "At ease," Dalinar said with a nod. The wideshouldered man stood with hands clasped behind his back. Something about Dalinar was imposing, even when he was relaxed. He looks like the generals from the stories, Kaladin thought. Thick of face and greying of hair, solid in the same way that a brick was. He didn't wear a uniform, the uniform wore him. Dalinar Kholin represented an ideal that Kaladin had long since decided was a mere fancy. "How are your accommodations?" Dalinar asked. "Sir? I'm in storming prison." A smile cracked Dalinar's face. "So I see. Calm yourself, soldier. If I'd ordered you to guard a room for a week, would you have done it?" "Yes." "Then consider this your duty. Guard this room." "I'll make sure nobody unauthorized runs off with the chamber pot, sir." "Elhokar is coming around. He's finished cooling off, and now only worries that releasing you too quickly will make him look weak. I'll need you to stay here a few more days, then we'll draft a formal pardon for your crime and have you reinstated to your position." "I don't see that I have any choice, sir." Dalinar stepped closer to the bars. "This is hard for you." Kaladin nodded. "You are well cared for, as are your men. Two of your bridgemen guard the way into the building at all times. There is nothing to worry you, soldier. If it's your reputation with me" "Sir," Kaladin said. "I guess I'm just not convinced that the king will ever let me go. He has a history of letting inconvenient people rot in dungeons until they die." As soon as he said the words, Kaladin couldn't believe they'd come from his lips. They sounded insubordinate, even treasonous. But they'd been sitting there, in his mouth, demanding to be spoken. Dalinar remained in his posture with hands clasped behind his back. "You speak of the silversmiths back in Kholinar?" So he did know. Stormfather . . . had Dalinar been involved? Kaladin nodded. "How did you hear of that incident?" "From one of my men," Kaladin said. "He knew the imprisoned people." "I had hoped we could escape those rumors," Dalinar said. "But of course, rumor grows like lichen, crusted on and impossible to completely scrub free. What happened with those people was a mistake, soldier. I'll admit that freely. The same won't happen to you." "Are the rumors about them true, then?" "I would really rather not speak of the Roshone affair." Roshone. Kaladin remembered screams. Blood on the floor of his father's surgery room. A dying boy. A day in the rain. A day when one man tried to steal away Kaladin's light. He eventually succeeded. "Roshone?" Kaladin whispered. "Yes, a minor lighteyes," Dalinar said, sighing. "Sir, it's important that I know of this. For my own peace of mind." Dalinar looked him up and down. Kaladin just stared straight ahead, mind . . . numb. Roshone. Everything had started to go wrong when Roshone had arrived in Hearthstone to be the new citylord. Before then, Kaladin's father had been respected. When that horrid man had arrived, dragging petty jealousy behind him like a cloak, the world had twisted upon itself. Roshone had infected Hearthstone like rotspren on an unclean wound. He was the reason Tien had gone to war. He was the reason Kaladin had followed. "I suppose I owe you this," Dalinar said. "But it is not to be spread around. Roshone was a petty man who gained Elhokar's ear. Elhokar was crown prince then, commanded to rule over Kholinar and watch the kingdom while his father organized our first camps here in the Shattered Plains. I was . . . away at the time. "Anyway, do not blame Elhokar. He was taking the advice of someone he trusted. Roshone, however, sought his own interests instead of those of the Throne. He owned several silversmith shops . . . well, the details are not important. Suffice it to say that Roshone led the prince to make some errors. I cleared it up when I returned." "You saw this Roshone punished?" Kaladin asked, voice soft, feeling numb. "Exiled," Dalinar said, nodding. "Elhokar moved the man to a place where he couldn't do any more harm." A place he couldn't do any more harm. Kaladin almost laughed. "You have something to say?" "You don't want to know what I think, sir." "Perhaps I don't. I probably need to hear it anyway." Dalinar was a good man. Blinded in some ways, but a good man. "Well, sir," Kaladin said, controlling his emotions with difficulty, "I find it . . . troubling that a man like this Roshone could be responsible for the deaths of innocent people, yet escape prison." "It was complicated, soldier. Roshone was one of Highprince Sadeas's sworn liegemen, cousin to important men whose support we needed. I originally argued that Roshone should be stripped of station and made a tenner, forced to live his life in squalor. But this would have alienated allies, and could have undermined the kingdom. Elhokar argued for leniency toward Roshone, and his father agreed via spanreed. I relented, figuring that mercy was not an attribute I should discourage in Elhokar." "Of course not," Kaladin said, clenching his teeth. "Though it seems that such mercy often ends up serving the cousins of powerful lighteyes, and rarely someone lowly." He stared through the bars between himself and Dalinar. "Soldier," Dalinar asked, voice cool. "Do you think I've been unfair toward you or your men?" "You. No, sir. But this isn't about you." Dalinar exhaled softly, as if in frustration. "Captain, you and your men are in a unique position. You spend your daily lives around the king. You don't see the face that is presented to the world, you see the man. It has ever been so for close bodyguards. "So your loyalty needs to be extra firm and generous. Yes, the man you guard has flaws. Every man does. He is still your king, and I will have your respect." "I can and do respect the Throne, sir," Kaladin said. Not the man sitting in it, perhaps. But he did respect the office. Somebody needed to rule. "Son," Dalinar said after a moment's thought, "do you know why I put you into the position that I did?" "You said it was because you needed someone you could trust not to be a spy for Sadeas." "That's the rationale," Dalinar said, stepping up closer to the bars, only inches from Kaladin. "But it's not the reason. I did it because it felt right." Kaladin frowned. "I trust my hunches," Dalinar said. "My gut said you were a man who could help change this kingdom. A man who could live through Damnation itself in Sadeas's camp and still somehow inspire others was a man I wanted under my command." His expression grew harder. "I gave you a position no darkeyes has ever held in this army. I let you into conferences with the king, and I listened when you spoke. Do not make me regret those decisions, soldier." "You don't already?" Kaladin asked. "I've come close," Dalinar said. "I understand, though. If you truly believe what you told me about Amaram . . . well, if I'd been in your place, I'd have been hard pressed not to do the same thing you did. But storm it, man, you're still a darkeyes." "It shouldn't matter." "Maybe it shouldn't, but it does. You want to change that? Well, you're not going to do it by screaming like a lunatic and challenging men like Amaram to duels. You'll do it by distinguishing yourself in the position I gave you. Be the kind of man that others admire, whether they be lighteyed or dark. Convince Elhokar that a darkeyes can lead. That will change the world." Dalinar turned and walked away. Kaladin couldn't help thinking that the man's shoulders seemed more bowed than when he'd entered. After Dalinar left, Kaladin sat back on his bench, letting out a long, annoyed breath. "Stay calm," he whispered. "Do as you're told, Kaladin. Stay in your cage." "He's trying to help," Syl said. Kaladin glanced to the side. Where was she hiding? "You heard about Roshone." Silence. "Yes," Syl finally said, voice sounding small. "My family's poverty," Kaladin said, "the way the town ostracized us, Tien being forced into the army, these things were all Roshone's fault. Elhokar sent him to us." Syl didn't respond. Kaladin fished a bit of flatbread from his bowl, chewing on it. StormfatherMoash really was right. This kingdom would be better off without Elhokar. Dalinar tried his best, but he had an enormous blind spot regarding his nephew. It was time someone stepped in and cut the ties binding Dalinar's hands. For the good of the kingdom, for the good of Dalinar Kholin himself, the king had to die. Some peoplelike a festering finger or a leg shattered beyond repairjust needed to be removed. Now, look what you've made me say. You've always been able to bring out the most extreme in me, old friend. And I do still name you a friend, for all that you weary me. What are you doing? the spanreed wrote to Shallan. Nothing much, she wrote back by spherelight, just working on Sebarial's income ledgers. She peeked out through the hole in her illusion, regarding the street far below. People flowed through the city as if marching to some strange rhythm. A dribble, then a burst, then back to a dribble. Rarely a constant flow. What caused that? You want to come visit? the pen wrote. This is getting really boring. Sorry, she wrote back to Adolin, I really need to get this work done. It might be nice to have a spanreed conversation to keep me company, though. Pattern hummed softly beside her at the lie. Shallan had used an illusion to expand the size of the shed atop this tenement in Sebarial's warcamp, providing a hidden place to sit and watch the street below. Five hours of waiting comfortable enough, with the stool and spheres for lighthad revealed nothing. Nobody had approached the lone stonebarked tree growing beside the pathway. She didn't know the species. It was too old to have been planted there recently; it must predate Sebarial's arrival. The gnarled, sturdy bark made her think it was some variety of dendrolith, but the tree also had long fronds that rose into the air like streamers, twisting and fluttering in the wind. Those were reminiscent of a dalewillow. She'd already done a sketch; she would look it up in her books later. The tree was used to people, and didn't pull in its fronds as they passed it. If someone had approached carefully enough to avoid brushing the fronds, Shallan would have spotted them. If, instead, they'd moved quickly, the fronds would have felt the vibrations and withdrawnwhich she also would have spotted. She was reasonably certain that if anyone had tried to fetch the item in the tree, she'd have known it, even if she'd been looking away for a moment. I suppose, the pen wrote, I can continue to keep you company. Shoren isn't doing anything else. Shoren was the ardent who wrote for Adolin today, come to visit by Adolin's order. The prince had pointedly noted that he was using an ardent, rather than one of his father's scribes. Did he think she'd grow jealous if he used another woman for scribing duties? He did seem surprised that she didn't get jealous. Were the women of the court so petty? Or was Shallan the odd one, too relaxed? His eyes did wander, and she had to admit that wasn't something that pleased her. And there was his reputation to consider. Adolin was said to have, in the past, changed relationships as frequently as other men changed coats. Perhaps she should cling more firmly, but the thought of it nauseated her. Such behavior reminded her of Father, holding so tightly to everything that he eventually broke it all. Yes, she wrote back to Adolin, using the board set on a box beside her, I'm certain the good ardent has nothing at all better to do than transcribe notes between two courting lighteyes. He's an ardent, Adolin sent. He likes to serve. It's what they do. I thought, she wrote, that saving souls was what they did. He's tired of that, Adolin sent. He told me that he already saved three this morning. She smiled, checking on the treestill no change. He did, did he? she wrote. Has them tucked away in his back pocket for safekeeping, I assume? No, Father's way was not right. If she wanted to keep Adolin, she had to try something far more difficult than just clinging to him. She'd have to be so irresistible that he didn't want to let go. Unfortunately, this was one area where neither Jasnah's training nor Tyn's would help. Jasnah had been indifferent toward men, while Tyn had not talked about keeping men, only distracting them for a quick con. Is your father feeling better? she wrote. Yes, actually. He's been up and about since yesterday, looking as strong as ever. Good to hear, she wrote. The two continued exchanging idle comments, Shallan watching the tree. Mraize's note had instructed her to come at sunrise and search the hole in the tree trunk for her instructions. So she'd come four hours early, while the sky was still dark, and sneaked up to the top of this building to watch. Apparently, she hadn't come early enough. She'd really wanted to get a view of them placing the instructions. "I don't like this," Shallan said, whispering to Pattern and ignoring the pen, which scribed Adolin's next line to her. "Why didn't Mraize just give me the instructions via spanreed? Why make me come here?" "Mmm . . ." Pattern said from the floor beneath her. The sun had long since risen. She needed to go get the instructions, but still she hesitated, tapping her finger against the papercovered board beside her. "They're watching," she realized. "What?" Pattern said. "They are doing exactly what I did. They are hiding somewhere, and want to watch me pick up the instructions." "Why? What does it accomplish?" "It gives them information," Shallan said. "And that is the sort of thing these people thrive upon." She leaned to the side, peering out of her hole, which would appear from the outside as a gap between two of the bricks. She didn't think Mraize wanted her dead, despite the sickening incident with the poor carriage driver. He'd given leave for the others around him to kill her, if they feared her, but thatlike so much about Mraizehad been a test. If you really are strong and clever enough to join us, that incident implied, then you'll avoid being assassinated by these people. This was another test. How did she pass it in a way that didn't leave anyone dead this time? They'd be watching for her to come get her instructions, but there weren't many good places to keep an eye on the tree. If she were Mraize and his people, where would she go to observe? She felt silly thinking it. "Pattern," she whispered, "go look in the windows of this building that face the street. See if anyone is sitting in one of them, watching as we are." "Very well," he said, sliding out of her illusion. She was suddenly conscious of the fact that Mraize's people might be hiding somewhere very close, but shoved aside her nervousness, reading Adolin's reply. Good news, by the way, the pen wrote. Father visited last night, and we talked at length. He's preparing his expedition out onto the Plains to fight the Parshendi, once and for all. Part of getting ready involves some scouting missions in the coming days. I got him to agree to bring you out onto the plateaus during one of them. And we can find a chrysalis? Shallan asked. Well, the pen wrote, even if the Parshendi aren't fighting over those anymore, Father doesn't take risks. I can't bring you on a run when there is a chance they might come and contest us. But, I've been thinking we can probably arrange the scouting mission so it passes by a plateau with a chrysalis a day or so after it was harvested. Shallan frowned. A dead, harvested chrysalis? she wrote. I don't know how much that will tell me. Well, Adolin replied, it's better than not seeing one at all, right? And you did say you wanted the chance to cut one up. This is almost the same thing. He was right. Besides, getting out onto the Plains was the real goal. Let's do it. When? In a few days. "Shallan!" She jumped, but it was only Pattern, buzzing with excitement. "You were right," he said. "Mmmm. She watches below. Only one level down, second room." "She?" "Mmm. The one with the mask." Shallan shivered. Now what? Go back to her rooms, then write to Mraize and say that she didn't appreciate being spied upon? It wouldn't accomplish anything useful. Looking down at her pad of paper, she realized that her relationship with Mraize was similar to her relationship with Adolin. In both cases, she couldn't just do as expected. She needed to excite, exceed. I'll need to go, she wrote to Adolin. Sebarial is asking for me. It might take me a while. She clicked off the spanreed and tucked it and the board away in her satchel. Not her usual one, but a rugged bag with a leather strap that went over her shoulder, like Veil would carry. Then, before she could lose her nerve, she ducked out of her illusory hiding place. She put her back to the wall of the shed, facing away from the street, then touched the side of the illusion and withdrew the Stormlight. That made the illusory section of wall vanish, quickly breaking down and streaming into her hand. Hopefully, nobody had been looking at the shed at that moment. If they had been, though, they would probably just think the change a trick of the eyes. Next, she knelt and used Stormlight to infuse Pattern and bind to him an image of Veil from a drawing she'd done earlier. Shallan nodded for him to move, and as he did, the image of Veil walked. She looked good. A confident stride, a swishing coat, peaked hat shading her face against the sun. The illusion even blinked and turned her head on occasion, as prescribed by the drawing sequence Shallan had done earlier. She watched, hesitating. Was that actually how she looked while wearing Veil's face and clothing? She didn't feel nearly that poised, and the clothing always seemed exaggerated, even silly, to her. On this image, it looked appropriate. "Go down," Shallan whispered to Pattern, "and walk to the tree. Try to approach carefully, slowly, and buzz loudly to get the tree's leaves to pull back. Stand at the trunk for a moment, as if retrieving the thing inside, then walk to the alleyway between this building and the next." "Yes!" Pattern said. He zipped off toward the stairs, excited to be part of the lie. "Slower!" Shallan said, wincing to see Veil's pace not matching her speed. "As we practiced!" Pattern slowed and reached the steps. Veil's image moved down them. Awkwardly. The illusion could walk and stand still on flat ground, but other terrainsuch as stepswasn't accommodated. To anyone watching, it would seem like Veil was stepping on nothing and gliding down the stairs. Well, it was the best they could do for the moment. Shallan took a deep breath and pulled on her hat, breathing out a second image, one that covered her over and transformed her into Veil. The one on Pattern would remain so long as he had Stormlight. That Stormlight drained from him a lot faster than it did from Shallan, though. She didn't know why. She went down the steps, but only one level, walking as quietly as she could. She counted over two doors in the dim hallway. The masked woman was inside that one. Shallan left it alone, instead ducking into an alcove by the stairwell, where she would be hidden from anyone in the hallway. She waited. A door eventually clicked open, and clothing rustled in the hallway. The masked woman passed Shallan's hiding place, amazingly quiet as she moved down the steps. "What is your name?" Shallan asked. The woman froze on the steps. She spungloved safehand on the knife at her sideand saw Shallan standing in the alcove. The woman's masked eyes flicked back toward the room she'd left. "I sent a double," Shallan said, "wearing my clothing. That's what you saw." The woman did not move, still crouched on the steps. "Why did he want you to follow me?" Shallan asked. "He's that interested in finding out where I'm staying?" "No," the woman finally said. "The instructions in the tree call for you to set about a task immediately, with no time to waste." Shallan frowned, considering. "So your job wasn't to follow me home, but to follow me on the mission. To watch how I accomplished it?" The woman said nothing. Shallan strolled forward and seated herself on the top step, crossing her arms on her legs. "So what is the job?" "The instructions are in" "I'd rather hear it from you," Shallan said. "Call me lazy." "How did you find me?" the woman asked. "A sharpeyed ally," Shallan said. "I told him to watch the windows, then send me word of where you were. I was waiting up above." She grimaced. "I was hoping to catch one of you placing the instructions." "We placed them before even contacting you," the woman said. She hesitated, then took a few steps upward. "Iyatil." Shallan cocked her head. "My name," the woman said. "Iyatil." "I've never heard one like it." "Unsurprising. Your task today was to investigate a certain new arrival into Dalinar's camp. We wish to know about this person, and Dalinar's allegiances are uncertain." "He's loyal to the king and the Throne." "Outwardly," the woman said. "His brother knew things of an extraordinary nature. We are uncertain if Dalinar was told of these things or not, and his interactions with Amaram worry us. This newcomer is linked." "Amaram is making maps of the Shattered Plains," Shallan said. "Why? What is out there that he wants?" And why would he want to return the Voidbringers? Iyatil didn't answer. "Well," Shallan said, rising, "let's get to it, then. Shall we?" "Together?" Iyatil said. Shallan shrugged. "You can sneak along behind, or you can just go with me." She extended her hand. Iyatil inspected the hand, then clasped it with her own gloved freehand in acceptance. She kept her other hand on the dagger at her side the entire time, though. * * * Shallan flipped through the instructions Mraize had left, as the oversized palanquin lurched along toward Dalinar's warcamp. Iyatil sat across from Shallan, legs tucked beneath her, watching with beady, masked eyes. The woman wore simple trousers and a shirt, such that Shallan had originally mistaken her for a boy that first time. Her presence was thoroughly unsettling. "A madman," Shallan said, flipping to the next page of instructions. "Mraize is this interested in a simple madman?" "Dalinar and the king are interested," Iyatil said. "So, then, are we." There did seem to be some sort of coverup involved. The madman had arrived in the custody of a man named Bordin, a servant whom Dalinar had stationed in Kholinar years ago. Mraize's information indicated that this Bordin was no simple messenger, but instead one of Dalinar's most trusted footmen. He had been left behind in Alethkar to spy on the queen, or so the Ghostbloods inferred. But why would someone need to keep an eye on the queen? The briefing didn't say. This Bordin had come to the Shattered Plains in haste a few weeks ago, bearing the madman and other mysterious cargo. Shallan's charge was to find out who this madman was and why Dalinar had hidden him away in a monastery with strict instructions that nobody was to be allowed access save specific ardents. "Your master knows more about this," Shallan said, "than he is telling me." "My master?" Iyatil asked. "Mraize." The woman laughed. "You mistake. He is not my master. He is my student." "In what?" Shallan asked. Iyatil stared at her with a level gaze and gave no reply. "Why the mask?" Shallan asked, leaning forward. "What does it mean? Why do you hide?" "I have many times asked myself," Iyatil said, "why those of you here go about so brazenly with features exposed to all who would see them. My mask reserves my self. Besides, it gives me the ability to adapt." Shallan sat back, thoughtful. "You are willing to ponder," Iyatil said. "Rather than asking question after question. This is good. Your instincts, however, must be judged. Are you the hunter, or are you the quarry?" "Neither," Shallan said immediately. "All are one or the other." The palanquin's porters slowed. Shallan peeked out the curtains and found that they had finally reached the edge of Dalinar's warcamp. Here, soldiers at the gates stopped each person in line waiting to enter. "How will you get us in?" Iyatil asked as Shallan closed the curtains. "Highprince Kholin has grown cautious of late, with assassins appearing in the night. What lie will gain us access to his realm?" Delightful, she thought, revising her list of tasks. Shallan not only had to infiltrate the monastery and discover information about this madman, she had to do it without revealing too much about herselfor what she could doto Iyatil. She had to think quickly. The soldiers at the front called for the palanquin to approachlighteyes wouldn't be required to wait in the ordinary line, and the soldiers would assume this nice a vehicle had someone rich inside. Taking a deep breath, Shallan removed her hat, pulled her hair forward over her shoulder, then pushed her face out of the curtains so that her hair hung down before her outside the palanquin. At the same moment, she withdrew her illusion and pulled the curtains closed behind her head, tight against her neck, to prevent Iyatil from seeing the transformation. The porters were parshmen, and she doubted the parshmen would say anything about what they saw her do. Their lighteyed master was turned away, fortunately. Her palanquin wobbled up to the front of the line, and the guards started when they saw her. They waved her through immediately. The face of Adolin's betrothed was well known by this point. Now, how to get Veil's appearance back on? There were people on the street here; she wasn't about to breathe Stormlight while hanging out the window. "Pattern," she whispered. "Go make a noise at the window on the other side of the palanquin." Tyn had drilled into her the need to make a distracting motion with one hand while palming an object with the other. The same principle might work here. A sharp yelp sounded from the other window. Shallan moved her head back into the palanquin with a quick motion, breathing out Stormlight. She flipped the curtains in a diverting way and obscured her face with the hat as she put it on. Iyatil looked back toward her from the window where the yelp had sounded, but Shallan was Veil again. She settled back, meeting Iyatil's gaze. Had the smaller woman seen? They rode in silence for a moment. "You bribed the guards ahead of time," Iyatil finally guessed. "I would know how you did this. Kholin's men are difficult to bribe. You got to one of the supervisors, perhaps?" Shallan smiled in what she hoped was a frustrating way. The palanquin continued on toward the warcamp's temple, a part of Dalinar's camp that she'd never visited. Actually, she hadn't been to visit Sebarial's ardents very often eitherthough when she had gone, she'd found them surprisingly devout, considering who owned them. She peeked out the window as they approached. Dalinar's temple grounds were as plain as she would have expected. Greyrobed ardents passed the palanquin in pairs or small groups, mixing among people of all stations. Those had come for prayers, instruction, or advicea good temple, properly equipped, could provide each of these things and more. Darkeyes from almost any nahn could come to be taught a trade, exercising their divine Right to Learn, as mandated by the Heralds. Lesser lighteyes came to learn trades as well, and the higher dahns came to learn the arts or progress in their Callings to please the Almighty. A large population of ardents like this one would have true masters in every art and trade. Perhaps she should come and seek Dalinar's artists for training. She winced, wondering where she would find time for such a thing. What with courting Adolin, infiltrating the Ghostbloods, researching the Shattered Plains, and doing Sebarial's ledgers, it was a wonder she had time to sleep. Still, it felt impious of her to expect success in her duties while ignoring the Almighty. She did need to have more concern for such things. And what is the Almighty to think of you? she wondered. And the lies you're growing so proficient at producing. Honesty was among the divine attributes of the Almighty, after all, which everyone was supposed to seek. The temple complex here included more than one building, though most people would only visit the main structure. Mraize's instructions had included a map, so she knew the specific building she neededone near the back, where the ardent healers saw to the sick and cared for people with longterm illnesses. "It will not be easy to enter," Iyatil said. "The ardents are protective of their charges, and have them locked away in the back, kept from the eyes of other men. They will not welcome an attempt at intrusion." "The instructions indicated that today was the perfect time to sneak in," Shallan said. "I was to make haste to not miss the opportunity." "Once a month," Iyatil said, "all may come to the temple to ask questions or see a physician with no offering requested. Today will be a busy day, a day of confusion. That will make for an easier time infiltrating, but it does not mean they will simply let you saunter in." Shallan nodded. "If you would rather do this at night," Iyatil said, "perhaps I can persuade Mraize that the matter can wait until then." Shallan shook her head. She had no experience sneaking about in the darkness. She'd just make a fool of herself. But how to get in . . . "Porter," she commanded, sticking her head out the window and pointing, "take us to that building there, then set us down. Send one of your number to seek the master healers. Tell them I need their aid." The tenner who led the parshmenhired with Shallan's spheresnodded brusquely. Tenners were a strange lot. This one didn't own the parshmen; he just worked for the woman who rented them out. Veil, with dark eyes, would be beneath him socially, but was also the one paying his wage, and so he just treated her as he would any other master. The palanquin settled down and one of the parshmen walked off to deliver her request. "Going to feign sickness?" Iyatil asked. "Something like that," Shallan said as footsteps arrived outside. She climbed out to meet a pair of squarebearded ardents, conferring as the parshmen led them in her direction. They looked her over, noting her dark eyes and her clothingwhich was wellmade but obviously intended for rugged use. Likely, they placed her in one of the uppermiddle nahns, a citizen, but not a particularly important one. "What is the problem, young woman?" asked the older of the two ardents. "It is my sister," Shallan said. "She has put on this strange mask and refuses to remove it." A soft groan rose from inside the palanquin. "Child," said the lead ardent, his tone suffering, "a stubborn sister is not a matter for the ardents." "I understand, good brother," Shallan said, raising her hands before her. "But this is no simple stubbornness. I think . . . I think one of the Voidbringers has inhabited her!" She pushed aside the curtains of the palanquin, revealing Iyatil inside. Her strange mask made the ardents pull back and break off their objections. The younger of the two men peered in at Iyatil with wide eyes. Iyatil turned to Shallan, and with an almost inaudible sigh, started rocking back and forth in place. "Should we kill them?" she muttered. "No. No, we shouldn't. But someone will see! No, do not say these things. No. I will not listen to you." She started humming. The younger ardent turned to look back at the senior. "This is dire," the ardent said, nodding. "Porter, come. Have your parshmen bring the palanquin." * * * A short time later, Shallan waited in the corner of a small monastery room, watching Iyatil sit and resist the ministration of several ardents. She kept warning them that if they removed her mask, she would have to kill them. That did not seem to be part of the act. Fortunately, she otherwise played her part well. Her ravings, mixed with her hidden face, gave even Shallan shivers. The ardents seemed alternately fascinated and horrified. Concentrate on the drawing, Shallan thought to herself. It was a sketch of one of the ardents, a portly man about her own height. The drawing was rushed but capable. She idly found herself wondering what a beard would feel like. Would it itch? But no, hair on your head didn't itch, so why should hair on your face? How did they keep food out of the things? She finished with a few quick marks, then rose quietly. Iyatil kept the ardents' attention with a new bout of raving. Shallan nodded to her in thanks, then slipped out of the door, entering the hallway. After glancing to the sides to see that she was alone, she used a cloud of Stormlight to transform into the ardent. That done, she reached up and tucked her straight red hairthe only part of her that threatened to pop out of the illusioninside the back of her coat. "Pattern," she whispered, turning and walking down the hallway with a relaxed demeanor. "Mmm?" "Find him," she said, removing from her satchel a sketch of the madman that Mraize had left in the tree. The sketch had been done at a distance, and wasn't terribly good. Hopefully . . . "Second hallway on the left," Pattern said. Shallan looked down at him, though her new costumean ardent's robe obscured him where he sat on her coat. "How do you know?" "You were distracted by your drawing," he said. "I peeked about. There is a very interesting woman four doors down. She appears to be rubbing excrement on the wall." "Ew." Shallan thought she could smell it. "Patterns . . ." he said as they walked. "I did not get a good look at what she was writing, but it seemed very interesting. I think I shall go and" "No," Shallan whispered, "stay with me." She smiled, nodding to several ardents who strolled past. They didn't speak to her, fortunately, merely nodding back. The monastery building, like most everything in Dalinar's warcamp, was sliced through with dull, unornamented hallways. Shallan followed Pattern's instructions to a thick door set into the stone. The lock clicked open with Pattern's help, and Shallan quietly slipped inside. A single small windowmore of a slitproved insufficient to fully illuminate the large figure sitting on the bed. Darkskinned, like a man from the Makabaki kingdoms, he had dark, ragged hair and hulking arms. Those were the arms of either a laborer or a soldier. The man sat slumped, back bowed, head down, frail light from the window cutting a slice across his back in white. It made for a grim, powerful silhouette. The man was whispering. Shallan couldn't make out the words. She shivered, her back to the door, and held up the sketch Mraize had given her. This seemed to be the same personat least, the skin color and stout build were the same, though this man was far more muscled than the picture indicated. Storms . . . those hands of his looked as if they could crush her like a cremling. The man did not move. He did not look up, did not shift. He was like a boulder that had rolled to a stop here. "Why is it kept so dark in this room?" Pattern asked, perfectly cheerful. The madman didn't react to the comment, or even Shallan, as she stepped forward. "Modern theory for helping the mad suggests dim confines," Shallan whispered. "Too much light stimulates them, and can reduce the effectiveness of treatment." That was what she remembered, at least. She hadn't read much on this subject. The room was dark. That window couldn't be more than a few fingers wide. What was he whispering? Shallan cautiously continued forward. "Sir?" she asked. Then she hesitated, realizing that she was projecting a young woman's voice from an old, fat ardent's body. Would that startle the man? He wasn't looking, so she withdrew the illusion. "He doesn't seem angry," Pattern said. "But you call him mad." "'Mad' has two definitions," Shallan said. "One means to be angry. The other means broken in the head." "Ah," Pattern said, "like a spren who has lost his bond." "Not exactly, I'd guess," Shallan said, stepping up to the madman. "But similar." She knelt down by the man, trying to figure out what he was saying. "The time of the Return, the Desolation, is at hand," he whispered. She would have expected an Azish accent from him, considering the skin color, but he spoke perfect Alethi. "We must prepare. You will have forgotten much, following the destruction of times past." She looked over at Pattern, lost in the shadows at the side of the room, then back at the man. Light glinted off his dark brown eyes, two bright pinpricks on an otherwise shadowed visage. That slumped posture seemed so morose. He whispered on, about bronze and steel, about preparations and training. "Who are you?" Shallan whispered. "Talenel'Elin. The one you call Stonesinew." She felt a chill. Then the madman continued, whispering the same things he had before, repeated exactly. She couldn't even be certain if his comment had been a reply to her question, or just a part of his recitation. He did not answer further questions. Shallan stepped back, folding her arms, satchel over her shoulder. "Talenel," Pattern said. "I know that name." "Talenelat'Elin is the name of one of the Heralds," Shallan said. "This is almost the same." "Ah." Pattern paused. "Lie?" "Undoubtedly," Shallan said. "It defies reason that Dalinar Kholin would have one of the Heralds of the Almighty locked away in a temple's back rooms. Many madmen think themselves someone else." Of course, many said that Dalinar himself was mad. And he was trying to refound the Knights Radiant. Scooping up a madman who thought he was one of the Heralds could be in line with that. "Madman," Shallan said, "where do you come from?" He continued ranting. "Do you know what Dalinar Kholin wishes of you?" More ranting. Shallan sighed, but knelt and wrote his exact words to deliver to Mraize. She got the entire sequence down, and listened to it twice through to make sure he wasn't going to say anything new. He didn't say his supposed name this time, though. So that was one deviation. He couldn't actually be one of the Heralds, could he? Don't be silly, she thought, tucking away her writing implements. The Heralds glow like the sun, wield the Honorblades, and speak with the voices of a thousand trumpets. They could cast down buildings with a command, force the storms to obey, and heal with a touch. Shallan walked to the door. By now, her absence in the other room would have been noticed. She should get back and give her lie, of seeking a drink for her parched throat. First, though, she'd want to put back on the ardent disguise. She sucked in some Stormlight, then breathed out, using the stillfresh memory of the ardent to create "Aaaaaaaah!" The madman leaped to his feet, screaming. He lurched for her, moving with incredible speed. As Shallan yelped in surprise, he grabbed her and shoved her out of her cloud of Stormlight. The image fell apart, evaporating, and the madman smashed her up against the wall, his eyes wide, his breathing ragged. He searched her face with frantic eyes, pupils darting back and forth. Shallan trembled, breath catching. Ten heartbeats. "One of Ishar's Knights," the madman whispered. His eyes narrowed. "I remember . . . He founded them? Yes. Several Desolations ago. No longer just talk. It hasn't been talk for thousands of years. But . . . When . . ." He stumbled back from her, hand to his head. Her Shardblade dropped into her hands, but she no longer appeared to need it. The man turned his back to her, walked to his bed, then lay down and curled up. Shallan inched forward, and found he was back to whispering the same things as before. She dismissed the Blade. Mother's soul . . . "Shallan?" Pattern asked. "Shallan, are you mad?" She shook herself. How much time had passed? "Yes," she said, walking hurriedly for the door. She peeked outside. She couldn't risk using Stormlight again in this room. She'd just have to slip out Blast. Several people approached down the hallway. She would have to wait for them to pass. Except, they seemed to be heading right to this very door. One of those men was Highlord Amaram. Yes, I'm disappointed. Perpetually, as you put it. Kaladin lay on his bench, ignoring the afternoon bowl of steamed, spiced tallew on the floor. He had begun to imagine himself as that whitespine in the menagerie. A predator in a cage. Storms send that he didn't end up like that poor beast. Wilted, hungry, confused. They don't do well in captivity, Shallan had said. How many days had it been? Kaladin found himself not caring. That worried him. During his time as a slave, he'd also stopped caring about the date. He wasn't so far removed from that wretch he'd once been. He felt himself slipping back toward that same mindset, like a man climbing a cliff covered in crem and slime. Each time he tried to pull himself higher, he slid back. Eventually he'd fall. Old ways of thinking . . . a slave's ways of thinking . . . churned within him. Stop caring. Worry only about the next meal, and keeping it away from the others. Don't think too much. Thinking is dangerous. Thinking makes you hope, makes you want. Kaladin shouted, throwing himself off his bench and pacing in the small room, hands to his head. He'd thought himself so strong. A fighter. But all they had to do to take that away was stuff him in a box for a few weeks, and the truth returned! He slammed himself against the bars and stretched a hand between them, toward one of the lamps on the wall. He sucked in a breath. Nothing happened. No Stormlight. The sphere continued to glow, even and steady. Kaladin cried out, reaching farther, pushing his fingertips toward that distant light. Don't let the darkness take me, he thought. He . . . prayed. How long had it been since he'd done that? He didn't have someone to properly write and burn the words, but the Almighty listened to hearts, didn't he? Please. Not again. I can't go back to that. Please. He strained for that sphere, breathing in. The Light seemed to resist, then gloriously streamed out into his fingertips. The storm pulsed in his veins. Kaladin held his breath, eyes shut, savoring it. The power strained against him, trying to escape. He pushed off the bars and started pacing again, eyes closed, not so frantic as before. "I'm worried about you." Syl's voice. "You're growing dark." Kaladin opened his eyes and finally found her, sitting between two of the bars as if on a swing. "I'll be all right," Kaladin said, letting Stormlight rise from his lips like smoke. "I just need to get out of this cage." "It's worse than that. It's the darkness . . . the darkness . . ." She looked to the side, then giggled suddenly, streaking off to inspect something on the floor. A little cremling that was creeping along the edge of the room. She stood over it, eyes widening at the stark red and violet color of its shell. Kaladin smiled. She was still a spren. Childlike. The world was a place of wonder to Syl. What would that be like? He sat down and ate his meal, feeling as if he'd pushed aside the gloom for a time. Eventually, one of the guards checked on him and found the dun sphere. He pulled it out, frowning, shaking his head before replacing it and moving on. * * * Amaram was coming into this room. Hide! Shallan was proud of how quickly she spat out the rest of her Stormlight, wreathing herself in it. She didn't even give thought to how the madman had reacted to her Lightweaving before, though perhaps she should have. Regardless, this time he didn't seem to notice. Should she become an ardent? No. Something much simpler, something faster. Darkness. Her clothing turned black. Her skin, her hat, her haireverything pure black. She scrambled back away from the door into the corner of the room, farthest from the slot of a window, stilling herself. With her illusion in place, the Lightweaving consumed the trails of Stormlight that would normally rise from her skin, further masking her presence. The door opened. Her heart thundered within her. She wished she'd had time to create a false wall. Amaram entered the room with a young darkeyed man, obviously Alethi, with short dark hair and prominent eyebrows. He wore Kholin livery. They shut the door quietly behind themselves, Amaram pocketing a key. Shallan felt an immediate anger at seeing her brother's murderer here, but found that it had quieted somewhat. A smoldering loathing instead of an intense hatred. It had been a long time since she'd seen Helaran, now. And Balat had a point in that her older brother had abandoned them. To try to kill this man, apparentlyor so she'd been able to put together from what she'd read of Amaram and his Shardblade. Why had Helaran gone to kill this man? And could she really blame Amaram when, in truth, he'd probably just been defending himself? She felt like she knew so little. Though Amaram was still a bastard, of course. Together, Amaram and the Alethi darkeyes turned to the madman. Shallan couldn't make out much of their features in the mostly dark room. "I don't know why you need to hear it for yourself, Brightlord," the servant said. "I told you what he said." "Hush, Bordin," Amaram said, crossing the room. "Listen at the door." Shallan stood stiff, pressed back in the corner. They'd see her, wouldn't they? Amaram knelt beside the bed. "Great Prince," he whispered, hand to the madman's shoulder. "Turn. Let me see you." The madman looked up, still muttering. "Ah . . ." Amaram said, breathing out. "Almighty above, ten names, all true. You are beautiful. Gavilar, we have done it. We have finally done it." "Brightlord?" Bordin said from the door. "I don't like being here. If we're discovered, people might ask questions. The treasure . . ." "He truly spoke of Shardblades?" "Yes," Bordin said. "A whole cache of them." "The Honorblades," Amaram whispered. "Great Prince, please, give me the same words you spoke to this one." The madman muttered on, the same as Shallan had heard. Amaram continued kneeling, but eventually he turned toward the nervous Bordin. "Well?" "He repeated those words every day," Bordin said, "but he only spoke of the Blades once." "I would hear of them for myself." "Brightlord . . . We could wait here days and not hear those words. Please. We must go. The ardents will eventually come by on their rounds." Amaram stood up with obvious reluctance. "Great Prince," he said to the huddled figure of the madman, "I go to recover your treasures. Speak not of them to the others. I will put the Blades to good use." He turned to Bordin. "Come. Let us search out this place." "Today?" "You said it was close." "Yes, well, that was why I brought him all the way out here. But" "If he accidentally speaks of this to others, I would have them go to the place and find it empty of treasures. Come, quickly. You will be rewarded." Amaram strode out. Bordin lingered at the door, looking at the madman, then trailed out and shut the door with a click. Shallan breathed out a long, deep breath, slumping down to the floor. "It's like that sea of spheres." "Shallan?" Pattern asked. "I've fallen in," she said, "and it isn't that the water is over my headit's that the stuff isn't even water, and I have no idea how to swim in it." "I do not understand this lie," Pattern said. She shook her head, the color bleeding back into her skin and clothing. She made herself look like Veil again, then walked to the door, accompanied by the sound of the madman's rambling. Herald of War. The time of the Return is near at hand. . . . Outside, she found her way back to the room with Iyatil, then apologized profusely to the ardents there who were looking for her. She pled that she had gotten lost, but said she'd accept an escort to take her back to her palanquin. Before going, however, she leaned down to hug Iyatil, as if to wish her sister farewell. "You can escape?" Shallan whispered. "Don't be stupid. Of course I can." "Take this," Shallan said, pressing a sheet of paper into Iyatil's gloved freehand. "I wrote upon it the ramblings of the madman. They repeat without change. I saw Amaram sneak into the room; he seems to think these words are authentic, and he seeks a treasure the madman spoke of earlier. I will write a thorough report via spanreed to you and the others tonight." Shallan moved to pull back, but Iyatil held on. "Who are you really, Veil?" the woman asked. "You caught me in stealth spying upon you, and you can lose me in the streets. This is not easily accomplished. Your clever drawings fascinate Mraize, another nearimpossible task, considering all that he has seen. Now what you have done today." Shallan felt a thrill. Why should she feel so excited to have the respect of these people? They were murderers. But storms take her, she had earned that respect. "I seek the truth," Shallan said. "Wherever it may be, whoever may hold it. That's who I am." She nodded to Iyatil, then pulled away and escaped the monastery. Later on that night, after sending in a full report of the day's eventsas well as promising drawings of the madman, Amaram, and Bordin for good measure she received back a simple message from Mraize. The truth destroys more people than it saves, Veil. But you have proven yourself. You no longer need fear our other members; they have been instructed not to touch you. You are required to get a specific tattoo, a symbol of your loyalty. I will send a drawing. You may add it to your person wherever you wish, but must prove it to me when we next meet. Welcome to the Ghostbloods. ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO What is a woman's place in this modern world? Jasnah Kholin's words read. I rebel against this question, though so many of my peers ask it. The inherent bias in the inquiry seems invisible to so many of them. They consider themselves progressive because they are willing to challenge many of the assumptions of the past. They ignore the greater assumptionthat a "place" for women must be defined and set forth to begin with. Half of the population must somehow be reduced to the role arrived at by a single conversation. No matter how broad that role is, it will beby naturea reduction from the infinite variety that is womanhood. I say that there is no role for womenthere is, instead, a role for each woman, and she must make it for herself. For some, it will be the role of scholar; for others, it will be the role of wife. For others, it will be both. For yet others, it will be neither. Do not mistake me in assuming I value one woman's role above another. My point is not to stratify our societywe have done that far too well alreadymy point is to diversify our discourse. A woman's strength should not be in her role, whatever she chooses it to be, but in the power to choose that role. It is amazing to me that I even have to make this point, as I see it as the very foundation of our conversation. Shallan closed the book. Not two hours had passed since Father had ordered Helaran's assassination. After Shallan had retreated to her room, a pair of Father's guards had appeared in the hallway outside. Probably not to watch her she doubted that Father knew that she'd overheard his order for Helaran to be killed. The guards were to see that Malise, Shallan's stepmother, did not try to flee. That could be a mistaken assumption. Shallan didn't even know if Malise was still alive, following her screaming and Father's cold, angry ranting. Shallan wanted to hide, to hunker down in her closet with blankets wrapped around her, eyes squeezed shut. The words in Jasnah Kholin's book strengthened her, though in some ways it seemed laughable for Shallan to even be reading it. Highlady Kholin talked about the nobility of choice, as if every woman had such opportunity. The decision between being a mother or a scholar seemed a difficult decision in Jasnah's estimation. That wasn't a difficult choice at all! That seemed like a grand place to be! Either would be delightful when compared to a life of fear in a house seething with anger, depression, and hopelessness. She imagined what Highlady Kholin must be, a capable woman who did not do as others insisted she must. A woman with power, authority. A woman who had the luxury of seeking her dreams. What would that be like? Shallan stood up. She walked to the door, then cracked it open. Though the evening had grown late, the two guards still stood at the other end of the hallway. Shallan's heart thumped, and she cursed her timidity. Why couldn't she be like women who acted, instead of being someone who hid in her room with a pillow around her head? Shaking, she slipped from the room. She padded toward the soldiers, feeling their eyes on her. One raised his hand. She didn't know the man's name. Once, she'd known all of the guards' names. Those men, whom she'd grown up with, had been replaced now. "My father will need me," she said, not stopping at the guard's gesture. Though he was lighteyed, she did not need to obey him. She might spend most of every day in her rooms, but she was still of a much higher rank than he. She walked by the men, trembling hands clenched tight. They let her go. When she passed her father's door, she heard soft weeping inside. Malise still lived, thankfully. She found Father in the feast hall, sitting alone with both firepits roaring, full of flames. He slumped at the high table, lit by harsh light, staring at the tabletop. Shallan slipped into the kitchen before he noticed her, and mixed his favorite. Deep violet wine, spiced with cinnamon and warmed against the chill day. He looked up as she walked back into the feast hall. She set the cup before him, looking into his eyes. No darkness there today. Just him. That was very rare, these days. "They won't listen, Shallan," he whispered. "Nobody will listen. I hate that I have to fight my own house. They should support me." He took the drink. "Wikim just stares at the wall half the time. Jushu is worthless, and Balat fights me every step. Now Malise too." "I will speak to them," Shallan said. He drank the wine, then nodded. "Yes. Yes, that would be good. Balat is still out with those cursed axehound corpses. I'm glad they're dead. That litter was full of runts. He didn't need them anyway. . . ." Shallan stepped into the chill air. The sun had set, but lanterns hung on the eaves of the manor house. She had rarely seen the gardens at night, and they took on a mysterious cast in the darkness. Vines looked like fingers reaching from the void, seeking something to grab and pull away into the night. Balat lay on one of the benches. Shallan's feet crunched on something as she stepped up to him. Claws from cremlings, pulled free of their bodies one after another, then tossed to the ground. She shivered. "You should go," she said to Balat. He sat up. "What?" "Father can no longer control himself," Shallan said softly. "You need to leave, while you can. I want you to take Malise with you." Balat ran his hand through his mess of curly dark hair. "Malise? Father will never let her go. He'd hunt us down." "He'll hunt you anyway," Shallan said. "He hunts Helaran. Earlier today, he ordered one of his men to find our brother and assassinate him." "What!" Balat stood. "That bastard! I'll . . . I . . ." He looked to Shallan in the darkness, face lit by starlight. Then he crumpled, sitting back down, holding his head in his hands. "I'm a coward, Shallan," he whispered. "Oh, Stormfather, I'm a coward. I won't face him. I can't." "Go to Helaran," Shallan said. "Could you find him, if you needed to?" "He . . . Yes, he left me the name of a contact in Valath who could put me in touch with him." "Take Malise and Eylita. Go to Helaran." "I won't have time to find Helaran before Father catches up." "Then we will contact Helaran," Shallan said. "We will make plans for you to meet him, and you can schedule your flight for a time when Father is away. He is planning another trip to Vedenar a few months from now. Leave when he's gone, get a head start." Balat nodded. "Yes . . . Yes, that is good." "I will draft a letter to Helaran," Shallan said. "We need to warn him about Father's assassins, and we can ask him to take the three of you in." "You shouldn't have to do this, small one," Balat said, head down. "I'm the eldest after Helaran. I should have been able to stop Father by now. Somehow." "Take Malise away," Shallan said. "That will be doing enough." He nodded. Shallan returned to the house, passing Father mulling over his disobedient family, and fetched some things from the kitchen. Then she returned to the steps and looked upward. Taking a few deep breaths, she went over what she would say to the guards if they stopped her. Then she raced up them and opened the door into her father's sitting room. "Wait," the hallway guard said. "He left orders. Nobody in or out." Shallan's throat tightened, and even with her practice, she stammered as she spoke. "I just talked to him. He wants me to speak with her." The guard inspected her, chewing on something. Shallan felt her confidence wilt, heart racing. Confrontation. She was as much a coward as Balat. He gestured to the other guard, who went downstairs to check. He eventually returned, nodding, and the first man reluctantly waved for her to continue. Shallan entered. Into the Place. She had not entered this room in years. Not since . . . Not since . . . She raised a hand, shading her eyes against the light coming from behind the painting. How could Father sleep in here? How was it that nobody else looked, nobody else cared? That light was blinding. Fortunately, Malise was curled in an easy chair facing that wall, so Shallan could put her back to the painting and obstruct the light. She rested a hand on her stepmother's arm. She didn't feel that she knew Malise, despite years living together. Who was this woman who would marry a man everyone whispered had killed his previous wife? Malise oversaw Shallan's educationmeaning she searched for new tutors each time the women fledbut Malise herself couldn't do much to teach Shallan. One could not teach what one did not know. "Mother?" Shallan asked. She used the word. Malise looked. Despite the blazing light of the room, Shallan saw the woman's lip was split and bleeding. She cradled her left arm. Yes, it was broken. Shallan took out the gauze and cloth she had fetched from the kitchen, then began to wipe down the wounds. She would have to find something to use as a splint for that arm. "Why doesn't he hate you?" Malise said harshly. "He hates everyone else but you." Shallan dabbed at the woman's lip. "Stormfather, why did I come to this cursed household?" Malise shuddered. "He'll kill us all. One by one, he'll break us and kill us. There's a darkness inside of him. I've seen it, behind his eyes. A beast . . ." "You're going to leave," Shallan said softly. Malise barked a laugh. "He'll never let me go. He never lets go of anything." "You're not going to ask," Shallan whispered. "Balat is going to run and join Helaran, who has powerful friends. He's a Shardbearer. He'll protect the both of you." "We'll never reach him," Malise said. "And if we do, why would Helaran take us in? We have nothing." "Helaran is a good man." Malise twisted in her seat, staring away from Shallan, who continued her ministrations. The woman whimpered when Shallan bound her arm, but wouldn't respond to questions. Finally, Shallan gathered up the bloodied cloths to throw away. "If I go," Malise whispered, "and Balat with me, who will he hate? Who will he hit? Maybe you, finally? The one who actually deserves it?" "Maybe," Shallan whispered, then left. Is not the destruction we have wrought enough? The worlds you now tread bear the touch and design of Adonalsium. Our interference so far has brought nothing but pain. Feet scraped on the stone outside of Kaladin's cage. One of the jailers checking on him again. Kaladin continued to lie motionless with closed eyes, and did not look. In order to keep the darkness at bay, he had begun planning. What would he do when he got out? When he got out. He had to tell himself that forcibly. It wasn't that he didn't trust Dalinar. His mind, though . . . his mind betrayed him, and whispered things that were not true. Distortions. In his state, he could believe that Dalinar lied. He could believe that the highprince secretly wanted Kaladin in prison. Kaladin was a terrible guard, after all. He'd failed to do anything about the mysterious countdowns scrawled on walls, and he'd failed to stop the Assassin in White. With his mind whispering lies, Kaladin could believe that Bridge Four was happy to be rid of himthat they pretended they wanted to be guards, just to make him happy. They secretly wanted to go on with their lives, lives they'd enjoy, without Kaladin spoiling them. These untruths should have seemed ridiculous to him. They didn't. Clink. Kaladin snapped his eyes open, growing tense. Had they come to take him, to execute him, as the king wished? He leaped to his feet, coming down in a battle stance, the empty bowl from his meal held to throw. The jailer at the cell door stepped back, eyes widening. "Storms, man," he said. "I thought you were asleep. Well, your time is served. King signed a pardon today. They didn't even strip your rank or position." The man rubbed his chin, then pulled the cell door open. "Guess you're lucky." Lucky. People always said that about Kaladin. Still, the prospect of freedom forced away the darkness inside of him, and Kaladin approached the door. Wary. He stepped out, the guard backing away. "You are a distrustful one, aren't you?" the jailer said. A lighteyes of low rank. "Guess that makes you a good bodyguard." The man gestured for Kaladin to leave the room first. Kaladin waited. Finally, the guard sighed. "Right, then." He walked out the doorway into the hall beyond. Kaladin followed, and with each step felt himself traveling back a few days in time. Shut the darkness away. He wasn't a slave. He was a soldier. Captain Kaladin. He'd survived this . . . what had it been? Two, three weeks? This short time back in a cage. He was free now. He could return to his life as a bodyguard. But one thing . . . one thing had changed. Nobody will ever, ever, do this to me again. Not king or general, not brightlord or brightlady. He would die first. They passed a leeward window, and Kaladin stopped to breathe in the cool, fresh scent of open air. The window gave an ordinary, mundane view of the camp outside, but it seemed glorious. A small breeze stirred his hair, and he let himself smile, reaching a hand to his chin. Several weeks' growth. He'd have to let Rock shave that. "Here," the jailer said. "He's free. Can we finally be done with this farce, Your Highness?" "Your Highness"? Kaladin turned down the hallway to where the guard had stopped at another cellone of the larger ones set into the hallway itself. Kaladin had been put in the deepest cell, away from the windows. The jailer twisted a key in the lock of the wooden door, then pulled it open. Adolin Kholinwearing a simple tight uniformstepped out. He also had several weeks of growth on his face, though the beard was blond, speckled black. The princeling took a deep breath, then turned toward Kaladin and nodded. "He locked you away?" Kaladin said, baffled. "How . . . ? What . . . ?" Adolin turned to the jailer. "Were my orders followed?" "They wait in the room just beyond, Brightlord," the jailer said, sounding nervous. Adolin nodded, moving in that direction. Kaladin reached the jailer, taking him by the arm. "What is happening? The king put Dalinar's heir in here?" "The king didn't have anything to do with it," the jailer said. "Brightlord Adolin insisted. So long as you were in here, he wouldn't leave. We tried to stop him, but the man's a prince. We can't storming make him do anything, not even leave. He locked himself away in the cell and we just had to live with it." Impossible. Kaladin glanced at Adolin, who walked slowly down the hallway. The prince looked a lot better than Kaladin feltAdolin had obviously seen a few baths, and his prison cell had been much larger, with more privacy. It had still been a cell. That was the disturbance I heard, Kaladin thought, on that day, early after I was imprisoned. Adolin came and shut himself in. Kaladin jogged up to the man. "Why?" "Didn't seem right, you in here," Adolin said, eyes forward. "I ruined your chance to duel Sadeas." "I'd be crippled or dead without you," Adolin said. "So I wouldn't have had the chance to fight Sadeas anyway." The prince stopped in the hallway, and looked at Kaladin. "Besides. You saved Renarin." "It's my job," Kaladin said. "Then we need to pay you more, bridgeboy," Adolin said. "Because I don't know if I've ever met another man who would jump, unarmored, into a fight among six Shardbearers." Kaladin frowned. "Wait. Are you wearing cologne? In prison?" "Well, there was no need to be barbaric, just because I was incarcerated." "Storms, you're spoiled," Kaladin said, smiling. "I'm refined, you insolent farmer," Adolin said. Then he grinned. "Besides, I'll have you know that I had to use cold water for my baths while here." "Poor boy." "I know." Adolin hesitated, then held out a hand. Kaladin clasped it. "I'm sorry," he said. "For ruining the plan." "Bah, you didn't ruin it," Adolin said. "Elhokar did that. You think he couldn't have simply ignored your request and proceeded, letting me expand on my challenge to Sadeas? He threw a tantrum instead of taking control of the crowd and pushing forward. Storming man." Kaladin blinked at the audacious tone, then glanced toward the jailer, who stood a distance behind, obviously trying to look inconspicuous. "The things you said about Amaram," Adolin said. "Were they true?" "Every one." Adolin nodded. "I've always wondered what that man was hiding." He continued walking. "Wait," Kaladin said, jogging to catch up, "you believe me?" "My father," Adolin said, "is the best man I know, perhaps the best man alive. Even he loses his temper, makes bad judgment calls, and has a troubled past. Amaram never seems to do anything wrong. If you listen to the stories about him, it's like everyone expects him to glow in the dark and piss nectar. That stinks, to me, of someone who works too hard to maintain his reputation." "Your father says I shouldn't have tried to duel him." "Yeah," Adolin said, reaching the door at the end of the hallway. "Dueling is formalized in a way I suspect you just don't get. A darkeyes can't challenge a man like Amaram, and you certainly shouldn't have done it like you did. It embarrassed the king, like spitting on a gift he'd given you." Adolin hesitated. "Of course, that shouldn't matter to you anymore. Not after today." Adolin pushed open the door. Beyond, most of the men of Bridge Four crowded into a small room where the jailers obviously spent their days. A table and chairs had been shoved to the corner to make room for the twentysomething men who saluted Kaladin as the door opened. Their salutes dissolved immediately as they started to cheer. That sound . . . that sound quashed the darkness until it vanished completely. Kaladin found himself smiling as he stepped out to meet them, taking hands, listening to Rock make a wisecrack about his beard. Renarin was there in his Bridge Four uniform, and he immediately joined his brother, speaking to him quietly in a jovial way, though he had out his little box that he liked to fidget with. Kaladin glanced to the side. Who were those men beside the wall? Members of Adolin's retinue. Was that one of Adolin's armorers? They carried some items draped with sheets. Adolin stepped into the room and loudly clapped his hands, quieting Bridge Four. "It turns out," Adolin said, "that I'm in possession of not one, but two new Shardblades and three sets of Plate. The Kholin princedom now owns a quarter of the Shards in all of Alethkar, and I've been named dueling champion. Not surprising, considering Relis was on a caravan back to Alethkar the night after our duel, sent by his father in an attempt to hide the shame of being beaten so soundly. "One complete set of those Shards is going to General Khal, and I've ordered two of the sets of Plate given to appropriate lighteyes of rank in my father's army." Adolin nodded toward the sheets. "That leaves one full set. Personally, I'm curious to know if the stories are true. If a darkeyes bonds a Shardblade, will his eyes change color?" Kaladin felt a moment of sheer panic. Again. It was happening again. The armorers removed the sheets, revealing a shimmering silvery Blade. Edged on both sides, a pattern of twisting vines ran up its center. At their feet, the armorers uncovered a set of Plate, painted orange, taken from one of the men Kaladin had helped defeat. Take these Shards, and everything changed. Kaladin immediately felt sick, almost cripplingly so. He turned back to Adolin. "I can do with these as I wish?" "Take them," Adolin said, nodding. "They are yours." "Not anymore," Kaladin said, pointing toward one of the members of Bridge Four. "Moash. Take these. You're now a Shardbearer." All of the color drained from Moash's face. Kaladin prepared himself. Last time . . . He flinched as Adolin grabbed him by the shoulder, but the tragedy of Amaram's army did not repeat. Instead, Adolin yanked Kaladin back into the hallway, holding up a hand to stop the bridgemen from talking. "Just a second," Adolin said. "Nobody move." Then, in a quieter voice, he hissed to Kaladin. "I'm giving you a Shardblade and Shardplate." "Thank you," Kaladin said. "Moash will use them well. He's been training with Zahel." "I didn't give them to him. I gave them to you." "If they're really mine, then I can do with them as I wish. Or are they not really mine?" "What's wrong with you?" Adolin said. "This is the dream of every soldier, darkeyed or light. Is this out of spite? Or . . . is it . . ." Adolin seemed completely baffled. "It's not out of spite," Kaladin said, speaking softly. "Adolin, those Blades have killed too many people I love. I can't look at them, can't touch them, without seeing blood." "You'd be lighteyed," Adolin whispered. "Even if it didn't change your eye color, you'd count as one. Shardbearers are immediately of the fourth dahn. You could challenge Amaram. Your whole life would change." "I don't want my life to change because I've become a lighteyes," Kaladin said. "I want the lives of people like me . . . like I am now . . . to change. This gift is not for me, Adolin. I'm not trying to spite you or anyone else. I just don't want a Shardblade." "That assassin is going to come back," Adolin said. "We both know it. I'd rather have you there with Shards to back me up." "I'll be more useful without them." Adolin frowned. "Let me give the Shards to Moash," Kaladin said. "You saw, on that field, that I can handle myself fine without a Blade and Plate. If we Shardup one of my best men, there will be three of us to fight him, not just two." Adolin looked into the room, then skeptically back at Kaladin. "You are crazy, you realize." "I'll accept that." "Fine," Adolin said, striding back into the room. "You. Moash, was it? I guess those Shards are yours, now. Congratulations. You now outrank ninety percent of Alethkar. Pick yourself a family name and ask to join one of the houses under Dalinar's banner, or start your own if you are inclined." Moash glanced at Kaladin for confirmation. Kaladin nodded. The tall bridgeman walked to the side of the room, reaching out a hand to rest his fingers on the Shardblade. He ran those fingers all the way down to the hilt, then seized it, lifting the Blade in awe. Like most, it was enormous, but Moash held it easily in one hand. The heliodor set into the pommel flashed with a burst of light. Moash looked to the others of Bridge Four, a sea of wide eyes and speechless mouths. Gloryspren rose around him, a spinning mass of at least two dozen spheres of light. "His eyes," Lopen said. "Shouldn't they be changing?" "If it happens," Adolin said, "it might not be until he's bonded the thing. That takes a week." "Put the Plate on me," Moash said to the armorers. Urgent, as if he feared it would be taken from him. "Enough of this!" Rock said as the armorers began to work, his voice filling the room like captive thunder. "We have party to give! Great Captain Kaladin, Stormblessed and dweller in prisons, you will come eat my stew now. Ha! I have been cooking it as long as you were locked away." Kaladin let the bridgemen usher him out into the sunlight, where a crowd of soldiers waitedincluding many of the bridgemen from other crews. These cheered, and Kaladin caught sight of Dalinar waiting off to the side. Adolin moved to join his father, but Dalinar watched Kaladin. What did that look mean? So pensive. Kaladin looked away, accepting the greetings of bridgemen as they clasped his hand and clapped him on the back. "What did you say, Rock?" Kaladin said. "You cooked a stew for each day I was locked in prison?" "No," Teft said, scratching his beard. "The storming Horneater has been cooking a single pot, letting it simmer for weeks now. He won't let us try it, and insists on getting up at night and tending it." "Is celebratory stew," Rock said, folding his arms. "Must simmer long time." "Well, let's get to it, then," Kaladin said. "I could certainly use something better than prison food." The men cheered, piling off toward their barrack. As they moved, Kaladin grabbed Teft by the arm. "How did the men take it?" he asked. "My imprisonment?" "There was talk of breaking you out," Teft admitted softly. "I beat some sense into them. Ain't no good soldier who hasn't spent a day or two locked up. It's part of the job. They didn't demote you, so they just wanted to slap your wrist a little. The men saw the truth of it." Kaladin nodded. Teft glanced at the others. "There's quite a lot of anger among them about this Amaram fellow. And a lot of interest. Anything about your past gets them talking, you know." "Lead them back to the barrack," Kaladin said. "I'll join you in a moment." "Don't take too long," Teft said. "The lads have been guarding this doorway for three weeks now. You owe them their celebration." "I'll be along," Kaladin said. "I just want to say a few things to Moash." Teft nodded and jogged off to wrangle the others. The prison's front room felt empty when Kaladin walked back in. Only Moash and the armorers remained. Kaladin walked up to them, watching Moash make a fist with his gauntlet. "I'm still having trouble believing this, Kal," Moash said as the armorers fit on his breastplate. "Storms . . . I'm now worth more than some kingdoms." "I wouldn't suggest selling the Shards, at least not to a foreigner," Kaladin said. "That sort of thing can be considered treason." "Sell?" Moash said, looking up sharply. He made another fist. "Never." He smiled, a grin of pure joy as the breastplate locked into place. "I'll help him with the rest," Kaladin said to the armorers. They withdrew reluctantly, leaving Kaladin and Moash alone. He helped Moash fit one of the pauldrons to his shoulder. "I had a lot of time to think, in there," Kaladin said. "I can imagine." "The time led me to a few decisions," Kaladin said as the section of Plate locked into place. "One is that your friends are right." Moash turned to him sharply. "So . . ." "So tell them I agree with their plan," Kaladin said. "I'll do what they want me to in order to help them . . . accomplish their task." The room grew strangely still. Moash took him by the arm. "I told them you'd see." He gestured to the Plate he wore. "This will help too, with what we must do. And once we've finished, I think a certain man you challenged might need the same treatment." "I only agree," Kaladin said, "because it's for the best. For you, Moash, this is about revengeand don't try to deny it. I really think it is what Alethkar needs. Maybe what the world needs." "Oh, I know," Moash said, putting on the helmet, visor up. He took a deep breath, then took a step and stumbled, nearly crashing to the ground. He steadied himself by grabbing a table, which he crunched beneath his fingers, the wood splitting. He stared at what he'd done, then laughed. "This . . . this is going to change everything. Thank you, Kaladin. Thank you." "Let's get those armorers and help you take it off," Kaladin said. "No. You go to Rock's storming feast. I'm going to the sparring grounds to practice! I won't take this off until I can move in it naturally." Having seen how much work Renarin was putting into learning his Plate, Kaladin suspected that might take longer than Moash wanted. He didn't say anything, instead stepping back out into the sunlight. He enjoyed that for a moment, eyes closed, head toward the sky. Then, he jogged off to rejoin Bridge Four. My path has been chosen very deliberately. Yes, I agree with everything you have said about Rayse, including the severe danger he presents. Dalinar stopped on the switchbacks down from the Pinnacle, Navani at his side. In the waning light, they watched a river of men flowing back into the warcamps from the Shattered Plains. The armies of Bethab and Thanadal were returning from their plateau run, following their highprinces, who had probably gotten back somewhat earlier. Down below, a rider approached the Pinnacle, likely with news for the king on the runs. Dalinar looked to one of his guardshe had four tonight, two for him, two for Navaniand gestured. "You want the details, Brightlord?" asked the bridgeman. "Please." The man jogged off down the switchbacks. Dalinar watched him go, thoughtful. These men were remarkably disciplined, considering their origin but they were not career soldiers. They did not like what he had done in throwing their captain into prison. He suspected they wouldn't let it become a problem. Captain Kaladin led them wellhe was the exact type of officer Dalinar looked for. The kind that showed initiative not because of a desire for advancement, but because of the satisfaction of a job well done. Those kinds of soldiers often had rocky starts until they learned to keep their heads. Storms. Dalinar himself had needed similar lessons pounded into him at various points in his life. He continued with Navani down the switchbacks, walking slowly. She looked radiant tonight, hair done with sapphires that glowed softly in the light. Navani liked these strolls together, and they were in no hurry to arrive at the feast. "I keep thinking," Navani said, continuing their previous conversation, "that there should be a way to use fabrials as pumps. You have seen the gemstones built to attract certain substances, but not othersit is most useful with something like smoke above a fire. Could we make this work with water?" Dalinar grunted, nodding. "More and more buildings in the warcamps are plumbed," she continued, "after the Kharbranthian mannerbut those use gravity itself as a way to conduct the liquid through their piping. I imagine true motion, with gemstones at the ends of piping segments to pull water through at a flow, against the pull of the earth. . . ." He grunted again. "We made a breakthrough in the design of new Shardblades the other day." "What, really?" he asked. "What happened? How soon will you have one ready?" She smiled, arm around his. "What?" "Just seeing if you are still you," she said. "Our breakthrough was realizing that the gemstones in the Bladesused to bond themmight not have originally been part of the weapons." He frowned. "That's important?" "Yes. If this is true, it means the Blades aren't powered by the stones. Credit goes to Rushu, who asked why a Shardblade can be summoned and dismissed even if its gemstone has gone dun. We had no answers, and she spent the last few weeks in contact with Kharbranth, using one of those new information stations. She came up with a scrap from several decades after the Recreance which talks about men learning to summon and dismiss Blades by adding gemstones to them, an accident of ornamentation it seems." He frowned as they passed a shalebark outcropping where a gardener was working late, carefully filing away and humming to himself. The sun had set; Salas had just risen in the east. "If this is true," Navani said, sounding happy, "we're back to knowing absolutely nothing about how Shardblades were crafted." "I don't see why that's a breakthrough at all." She smiled, patting him on the arm. "Imagine you had spent the last five years believing an enemy had been following Dialectur's War as a model for tactics, but then heard it reported they instead had never heard of the treatise." "Ah . . ." "We had been assuming that somehow, the strength and lightness of the Blades was a fabrial construct powered by the gemstone," Navani said. "This might not be the case. It seems the gemstone's purpose is only used in initially bonding the Bladesomething that the Radiants didn't need to do." "Wait. They didn't?" "Not if this fragment is correct. The implication is that the Radiants could always dismiss and summon Bladesbut for a time the ability was lost. It was only recovered when someone added a gemstone to his Blade. The fragment says the weapons actually shifted shape to adopt the stones, but I'm not certain if I trust that. "Either way, after the Radiants fell but before men learned to put gemstones into their Blades and bond them, the weapons were apparently still supernaturally sharp and light, though bonding was impossible. This would explain several other fragments of records I've read and found confusing. . . ." She continued, and he found her voice pleasant. The details of fabrial construction, however, were not pressing to him at the moment. He did care. He had to care. Both for her, and for the needs of the kingdom. He just couldn't care right now. In his head, he went over preparations for the expedition out onto the Shattered Plains. How to protect the Soulcasters from sight, as they preferred. Sanitation shouldn't be an issue, and water would be plentiful. How many scribes would he need to bring? Horses? Only one week remained, and he had the majority of the preparations in place, such as mobile bridge construction and supply estimations. There was always more to plan, however. Unfortunately, the biggest variable was one he couldn't plan for, not specifically. He didn't know how many troops he'd have. It depended on which of the highprinces, if any, agreed to go with him. Less than a week out, and he still wasn't certain if any of them would. I could use Hatham most, Dalinar thought. He runs a tight army. If only Aladar hadn't sided with Sadeas so vigorously; I can't figure that man out. Thanadal and Bethab . . . storms, will I bring their mercenaries if either of those two agree to come? Is that the kind of force I want? Dare I refuse any spear that comes to me? "I'm not going to get a good conversation out of you tonight, am I?" Navani asked. "No," he admitted as they reached the base of the Pinnacle and turned south. "I'm sorry." She nodded, and he could see the mask cracking. She talked about her work because it was something to talk about. He stopped beside her. "I know it hurts," he said softly. "But it will get better." "She wouldn't let me be a mother to her, Dalinar," Navani said, staring into the distance. "Do you know that? It was almost like . . . like once Jasnah climbed into adolescence, she no longer needed a mother. I would try to get close to her, and there was this coldness, like even being near me reminded her that she had once been a child. What happened to my little girl, so full of questions?" Dalinar pulled her close; propriety could seek Damnation. Nearby, the three guards shuffled, looking the other way. "They'll take my son too," Navani whispered. "They're trying." "I will protect him," Dalinar promised. "And who will protect you?" He had no answer to that. Answering that his guards would do it sounded trite. That wasn't the question she'd asked. Who will protect you when that assassin returns? "I almost wish that you would fail," she said. "In holding this kingdom together, you make a target of yourself. If everything just collapsed, and we fractured back to princedoms, perhaps he'd leave us alone." "And then the storm would come," Dalinar replied softly. Twelve days. Navani eventually pulled back, nodding, composing herself. "You're right, of course. I just . . . this is the first time, for me. Dealing with this. How did you manage it, when Shshshsh died? I know you loved her, Dalinar. You don't have to deny it for my ego." He hesitated. The first time; an implication that when Gavilar had died, she had not been broken up about it. She had never stated so outright an implication of the . . . difficulties the two had been having. "I'm sorry," she said. "Was that too difficult a question, considering its source?" She tucked away her kerchief, which she'd used to dab her eyes dry. "I apologize; I know that you don't like to talk about her." It wasn't that it was a difficult question. It was that Dalinar didn't remember his wife. How odd, that he could go weeks without even noticing this hole in his memories, this change that had ripped out a piece of him and left him patched over. Without even a prick of emotion when her name, which he could not hear, was mentioned. Best to move to some other topic. "I cannot help but assume that the assassin is involved in all of this, Navani. The storm that comes, the secrets of the Shattered Plains, even Gavilar. My brother knew something, something he never shared with any of us." You must find the most important words a man can say. "I would give almost anything to know what it was." "I suppose," Navani said. "I will go back to my journals of the time. Perhaps he said something that would give us cluesthough I warn you, I've pored over those accounts dozens of times." Dalinar nodded. "Regardless, that isn't a worry for today. Today, they are our goal." They turned, looking as coaches clattered past, making their way to the nearby feasting basin, where lights glowed a soft violet in the night. He narrowed his eyes and found Ruthar's coach approaching. The highprince had been stripped of Shards, all but his own Blade. They had cut off Sadeas's right hand in this mess, but the head remained. And it was venomous. The other highprinces were almost as big a problem as Sadeas. They resisted him because they wanted things to be easy, as they had been. They glutted themselves on their riches and their games. Feasts manifested that all too much, with their exotic food, their rich costumes. The world itself seemed close to ending, and the Alethi threw a party. "You must not despise them," Navani said. Dalinar's frown deepened. She could read him too well. "Listen to me, Dalinar," she said, turning him to meet her eyes. "Has any good ever come from a father hating his children?" "I don't hate them." "You loathe their excess," she said, "and you are close to applying that emotion to them as well. They live the lives they have known, the lives that society has taught them are proper. You won't change them with contempt. You aren't Wit; it isn't your job to scorn them. Your job is to enfold them, encourage them. Lead them, Dalinar." He drew a deep breath, and nodded. "I will go to the women's island," she said, noticing the bridgeman guard returning with news on the plateau assault. "They consider me an eccentric vestige of things better left in the past, but I think they still listen to me. Sometimes. I'll do what I can." They parted, Navani hurrying to the feast, Dalinar idling as the bridgeman passed his news. The plateau run had been successful, a gemheart captured. It had taken quite a long time to reach the target plateau, which was deep into the Plainsalmost to the edge of the scouted area. The Parshendi had not appeared to contest the gemheart, though their scouts had watched from a distance. Again they decide not to fight, Dalinar thought, walking the last distance to the feast. What does the change mean? What are they planning? The feast basin was made up of a series of Soulcast islands beside the Pinnacle complex. It had been flooded, as it often was, in a way that made the Soulcast mounds rise between small rivers. The water glowed. Spheres, and a lot of them, must have been dumped into the water to give it that ethereal cast. Purple, to match the moon that was just rising, violet and frail on the horizon. Lanterns were placed intermittently, but with dim spheres, perhaps to not distract from the glowing water. Dalinar crossed the bridges to the farthest island the king's island, where the genders mixed and only the most powerful were invited. This was where he knew he'd find the highprinces. Even Bethab, who had just returned from his plateau run, was already in attendancethough, as he preferred to use mercenary companies for the bulk of his army, it wasn't surprising he had returned so quickly from the run. Once they captured the gemheart, he'd often ride back quickly with the prize, letting them sort out how to return. Dalinar passed Witwho had arrived back at the warcamps with characteristic mysteryinsulting everyone who passed. He had no wish to fence words with the man today. Instead, he sought out Vamah; the highprince seemed to have actually listened to Dalinar's pleas during their most recent dinner. Perhaps with more nudging, he would commit to joining Dalinar's assault on the Parshendi. Eyes followed Dalinar as he crossed the island, and whispered conversations broke out like rashes as he passed. He expected those looks by now, though they still unnerved him. Were they more plentiful this night? More lingering? He couldn't move in Alethi society these days without catching a smile on the lips of too many people, as if they were all part of some grand joke that he had not been told. He found Vamah speaking with a group of three older women. One was Sivi, a highlady from Ruthar's court whocontrary to customhad left her husband at home to see to their lands, coming to the Shattered Plains herself. She eyed Dalinar with a smile and eyes like daggers. The plot to undermine Sadeas had to a large extent failedbut that was in part because the damage and shame had been deflected to Ruthar and Aladar, who had suffered the loss of Shardbearers in the men who had dueled Adolin. Well, those two were never going to have been Dalinar'sthey were Sadeas's strongest supporters. The four people grew silent as Dalinar stepped up to them. Highprince Vamah squinted in the dim light, looking Dalinar up and down. The roundfaced man had a cupbearer standing behind him with a bottle of some exotic liquor or another. Vamah often brought his own spirits to feasts, regardless of who hosted them; being engaging enough a conversationalist to earn a sip of what he'd managed to import was considered a political triumph by many attendees. "Vamah," Dalinar said. "Dalinar." "There's a matter I've been wanting to discuss with you," Dalinar said. "I find it impressive what you've been able to do with light cavalry on your plateau runs. Tell me, how do you decide when to risk an allout assault with your riders? The loss of horses could easily overwhelm your earnings from gemhearts, but you have managed to balance this with clever stratagems." "I . . ." Vamah sighed, looking to the side. A group of young men nearby was snickering as they looked toward Dalinar. "It is a matter of . . ." Another sound, louder, came from the opposite side of the island. Vamah started again, but his eyes flicked in that direction, and a round of laughter burst out more loudly. Dalinar forced himself to look, noting women with hands to mouths, men covering their exclamations with coughs. A halfhearted attempt at maintaining Alethi propriety. Dalinar looked back at Vamah. "What is happening?" "I'm sorry, Dalinar." Beside him, Sivi tucked some sheets of paper under her arm. She met Dalinar's gaze with a forced nonchalance. "Excuse me," Dalinar said. Hands forming fists, he crossed the island toward the source of the disturbance. As he neared, they quieted and people broke up into smaller groups, moving off. It almost seemed planned how quickly they dispersed, leaving him to face Sadeas and Aladar, standing side by side. "What are you doing?" Dalinar demanded of the two of them. "Feasting," Sadeas said, then shoved a piece of fruit into his mouth. "Obviously." Dalinar drew in a deep breath. He glanced at Aladar, longnecked and bald, with his mustache and tuft of hair on his bottom lip. "You should be ashamed," Dalinar growled at him. "My brother once called you a friend." "And not me?" Sadeas said. "What have you done?" Dalinar demanded. "What is everyone talking about, snickering about behind their hands?" "You always assume it's me," Sadeas said. "That's because any time I think it isn't you, I'm wrong." Sadeas gave him a thinlipped smile. He started to reply, but then thought a moment, and finally just stuffed another chunk of fruit in his mouth. He chewed and smiled. "Tastes good," was all he said. He turned to walk away. Aladar hesitated. Then he shook his head and followed. "I never figured you for a pup to follow at a master's heels, Aladar," Dalinar called after him. No reply. Dalinar growled, moving back across the island, looking for someone from his own warcamp who might have heard what was happening. Elhokar was late to his own feast, it seemed, though Dalinar did see him approaching outside now. No sign of Teshav or Khal yetthey would undoubtedly make an appearance, now that he was a Shardbearer. Dalinar might have to move to one of the other islands, where lesser lighteyes would be mingling. He started that way, but stopped as he heard something. "Why, Brightlord Amaram," Wit cried. "I was hoping I'd be able to see you tonight. I've spent my life learning to make others feel miserable, and so it's a true joy to meet someone so innately talented in that very skill as you are." Dalinar turned, noticing Amaram, who had just arrived. He wore his cape of the Knights Radiant and carried a sheaf of papers stuck under his arm. He stopped beside Wit's chair, the nearby water casting a lavender tone across their skin. "Do I know you?" Amaram asked. "No," Wit said lightly, "but fortunately, you can add it to the list of many, many things of which you are ignorant." "But now I've met you," Amaram said, holding out a hand. "So the list is one smaller." "Please," Wit said, refusing the hand. "I wouldn't want it to rub off on me." "It?" "Whatever you've been using to make your hands look clean, Brightlord Amaram. It must be powerful stuff indeed." Dalinar hurried over. "Dalinar," Wit said, nodding. "Wit. Amaram, what are those papers?" "One of your clerks seized them and brought them to me," Amaram said. "Copies were being passed around the feast before your arrival. Your clerk thought Brightness Navani might want to see them if she hasn't already. Where is she?" "Staying away from you, obviously," Wit noted. "Lucky woman." "Wit," Dalinar said sternly, "do you mind?" "Rarely." Dalinar sighed, looking back to Amaram and taking the papers. "Brightness Navani is on another island. Do you know what these say?" Amaram's expression grew grim. "I wish I didn't." "I could hit you in the head with a hammer," Wit said happily. "A good bludgeoning would make you forget and do wonders for that face of yours." "Wit," Dalinar said flatly. "I'm only joking." "Good." "A hammer would hardly dent that thick skull of his." Amaram turned to Wit, a look of bafflement on his face. "You're very good at that expression," Wit noted. "A great deal of practice, I assume?" "This is the new Wit?" Amaram asked. "I mean," Wit said, "I wouldn't want to call Amaram an imbecile . . ." Dalinar nodded. ". . . because then I'd have to explain to him what the word means, and I'm not certain any of us have the requisite time." Amaram sighed. "Why hasn't anyone killed him yet?" "Dumb luck," Wit said. "In that I'm lucky you're all so dumb." "Thank you, Wit," Dalinar said, taking Amaram by the arm and towing him to the side. "One more, Dalinar!" Wit said. "Just one last insult, and I leave him alone." They continued walking. "Lord Amaram," Wit called, standing to bow, his voice growing solemn. "I salute you. You are what lesser cretins like Sadeas can only aspire to be." "The papers?" Dalinar said to Amaram, pointedly ignoring Wit. "They are accounts of your . . . experiences, Brightlord," Amaram said softly. "The ones you have during the storms. Written by Brightness Navani herself." Dalinar took the papers. His visions. He looked up and saw groups of people collecting on the island, chatting and laughing, shooting glances at him. "I see," he said softly. It made sense now, the hidden snickering. "Find Brightness Navani for me, if you would." "As you request," Amaram said, but stopped short, pointing. Navani stalked across the next island over, heading toward them with a tempestuous air about her. "What do you think, Amaram?" Dalinar said. "Of the things that are being said of me?" Amaram met his eyes. "They are obviously visions from the Almighty himself, given to us in a time of great need. I wish I had known their contents earlier. They give me great confidence in my position, and in your appointment as prophet of the Almighty." "A dead god can have no prophets." "Dead . . . No, Dalinar! You obviously misinterpret that comment from your visions. He speaks of being dead in the minds of men, that they no longer listen to his commands. God cannot die." Amaram seemed so earnest. Why didn't he help your sons? Kaladin's voice rang in Dalinar's mind. Amaram had come to him that day, of course, professing his apologies and explaining thatwith his appointment as a Radianthe couldn't possibly have helped one faction against another. He said he needed to be above the squabbles between highprinces, even when it pained him. "And the supposed Herald?" Dalinar asked. "The thing I asked you about?" "I am still investigating." Dalinar nodded. "I was surprised," Amaram noted, "that you left the slave as head of your guard." He glanced to the side, to where Dalinar's guards for the night stood, just off the island in their own area, waiting with the other bodyguards and attendants, including many of the wards of the highladies present. There had been a time not too long ago when few had felt the need to bring their guards with them to a feast. Now, the place was crowded. Captain Kaladin wasn't there; he was resting, after his imprisonment. "He's a good soldier," Dalinar said softly. "He just carries a few scars that are having trouble healing." Vedeledev knows, Dalinar thought, I have a few of those myself. "I merely worry that he is incapable of properly protecting you," Amaram said. "Your life is important, Dalinar. We need your visions, your leadership. Still, if you trust the slave, then so be itthough I certainly wouldn't mind hearing an apology from him. Not for my own ego, but to know that he's put aside this misconception of his." Dalinar gave no reply as Navani strode across the short bridge onto their island. Wit started to proclaim an insult, but she swatted him in the face with a stack of papers, giving him barely a glance as she continued on toward Dalinar. Wit watched after, rubbing his cheek, and grinned. She noted the papers in his hand as she joined the two of them, who seemed to stand among a sea of amused eyes and hushed laughter. "They added words," Navani hissed. "What?" Dalinar demanded. She shook the papers. "These! You've heard what they contain?" He nodded. "They aren't as I wrote them," Navani said. "They've changed the tone, some of my words, to imply a ridiculousness to the entire experienceand to make it sound as if I am merely indulging you. What's worse, they added a commentary in another handwriting that pokes fun at what you say and do." She took a deep breath, as if to calm herself. "Dalinar, they're trying to destroy any shred of credibility left to your name." "I see." "How did they get these?" Amaram asked. "Through theft, I do not doubt," Dalinar said, realizing something. "Navani and my sons always have guardsbut when they leave their rooms, those are relatively unprotected. We may have been too lax in that regard. I misunderstood. I thought his attacks would be physical." Navani looked out at the sea of lighteyes, many congregating in groups around the various highprinces in the soft, violet light. She stepped closer to Dalinar, and though her eyes were fierce, he knew her well enough to guess what she was feeling. Betrayal. Invasion. That which was private to them, opened up, mocked and then displayed for the world. "Dalinar, I'm sorry," Amaram said. "They did not change the visions themselves?" Dalinar asked. "They copied them accurately." "So far as I can tell, yes," Navani said. "But the tone is different, and that mockery. Storms. It's nauseating. When I find the woman who did this . . ." "Peace, Navani," Dalinar said, resting his hand on her shoulder. "How can you say that?" "Because this is the act of childish men who assume that I can be embarrassed by the truth." "But the commentary! The changes. They've done everything they can to discredit you. They even managed to undermine the part where you offer a translation of the Dawnchant. It" "'As I fear not a child with a weapon he cannot lift, I will never fear the mind of a man who does not think.'" Navani frowned at him. "It's from The Way of Kings," Dalinar said. "I am not a youth, nervous at his first feast. Sadeas makes a mistake in believing I will respond to this as he would. Unlike a sword, scorn has only the bite you give it." "This does hurt you," Navani said, meeting his eyes. "I can see it, Dalinar." Hopefully, the others would not know him well enough to see what she did. Yes, it did hurt. It hurt because these visions were his, entrusted to himto be shared for the good of men, not to be held up for mockery. It was not the laughter itself that pained him, but the loss of what could have been. He stepped away from her, passing through the crowd. Some of those eyes he now interpreted as being sorrowful, not just amused. Perhaps he was imagining it, but he thought some pitied him more than scorned him. He wasn't certain which emotion was more damaging. Dalinar reached the food table at the back of the island. There, he picked up a large pan and handed it to a bewildered serving woman, then hauled himself up onto the table. He set one hand on the lantern pole beside the table and looked out over the small crowd. They were the most important people in Alethkar. Those who hadn't already been watching him turned with shock to see him up there. In the distance, he noticed Adolin and Brightness Shallan rushing onto the island. They'd likely only just arrived, and heard the talk. Dalinar looked to the crowd. "What you have read," he bellowed, "is true." Stunned silence. Making a spectacle of oneself in this way was not done in Alethkar. He, however, had already been this evening's spectacle. "Commentary has been added to discredit me," Dalinar said, "and the tone of Navani's writing has been changed. But I will not hide what has been happening to me. I see visions from the Almighty. They come with almost every storm. This should not surprise you. There have been rumors circulating about my experiences for weeks now. Perhaps I should have released these visions already. In the future, each one I receive will be published, so that scholars around the world can investigate what I have seen." He sought out Sadeas, who stood with Aladar and Ruthar. Dalinar gripped the lantern pole, looking back at the Alethi crowd. "I do not blame you for thinking I am mad. It is natural. But in the coming nights, when rain washes your walls and the wind howls, you will wonder. You will question. And soon, when I offer you proof, you will know. This attempt to destroy me will then vindicate me instead." He looked over their faces, some aghast, some sympathetic, others amused. "There are those among you who assume I will flee, or be broken, because of this attack," he said. "They do not know me as well as they presume. Let the feast continue, for I wish to speak with each and every one of you. The words you hold may mock, but if you must laugh, do it while looking me in the eyes." He stepped down from the table. Then he went to work. * * * Hours later, Dalinar eventually let himself sit down in a seat beside a table at the feast, exhaustionspren swirling around him. He'd spent the rest of the evening moving through the crowd, forcing his way into conversations, drumming up support for his excursion onto the Plains. He had pointedly ignored the pages with his visions on them, except when asked direct questions about what he'd seen. Instead, he had presented them with a forceful, confident manthe Blackthorn turned politician. Let them chew on that and compare him to the frail madman the falsified transcripts would make him out to be. Outside, past the small riversthey now glowed blue, the spheres having been changed to match the second moonthe king's carriage rolled away, bearing Elhokar and Navani the short distance to the Pinnacle, where porters would carry them in a palanquin up to the top. Adolin had already retired, escorting Shallan back to Sebarial's warcamp, which was a fair ride away. Adolin seemed to be fonder of the young Veden woman than of any woman in the recent past. For that reason alone, Dalinar was increasingly inclined to encourage the relationship, assuming he could ever get some straight answers out of Jah Keved about her family. That kingdom was a mess. Most of the other lighteyes had retired, leaving him on an island populated by servants and parshmen who cleared away food. A few masterservants, trusted for such duties, began to scoop the spheres out of the river with nets on long poles. Dalinar's bridgemen, at his suggestion, were attacking the feast's leftovers with the voracious appetite exclusive to soldiers who had been offered an unexpected meal. A servant strolled by, then stopped, resting his hand on his side sword. Dalinar started, realizing he'd mistaken Wit's black military uniform for that of a masterservant in training. Dalinar put on a firm face, though inwardly he groaned. Wit? Now? Dalinar felt as if he'd been fighting on the battlefield for ten hours straight. Odd, how a few hours of delicate conversation could feel so similar to that. "What you did tonight was clever," Wit said. "You turned an attack into a promise. The wisest of men know that to render an insult powerless, you often need only to embrace it." "Thank you," Dalinar said. Wit nodded curtly, following the king's coach with his eyes as it vanished. "I found myself without much to do tonight. Elhokar was not in need of Wit, as few sought to speak to him. All came to you instead." Dalinar sighed, his strength seeming to drain away. Wit hadn't said it, but he hadn't needed to. Dalinar read the implication. They came to you, instead of the king. Because essentially, you are king. "Wit," Dalinar found himself asking, "am I a tyrant?" Wit cocked an eyebrow, and seemed to be looking for a clever quip. A moment later, he discarded the thought. "Yes, Dalinar Kholin," he said softly, consolingly, as one might speak to a tearful child. "You are." "I do not wish to be." "With all due respect, Brightlord, that is not quite the truth. You seek for power. You take hold, and let go only with great difficulty." Dalinar bowed his head. "Do not sorrow," Wit said. "It is an era for tyrants. I doubt this place is ready for anything more, and a benevolent tyrant is preferable to the disaster of weak rule. Perhaps in another place and time, I'd have denounced you with spit and bile. Here, today, I praise you as what this world needs." Dalinar shook his head. "I should have allowed Elhokar his right of rule, and not interfered as I did." "Why?" "Because he is king." "And that position is something sacrosanct? Divine?" "No," Dalinar admitted. "The Almighty, or the one claiming to be him, is dead. Even if he hadn't been, the kingship didn't come to our family naturally. We claimed it, and forced it upon the other highprinces." "So then why?" "Because we were wrong," Dalinar said, narrowing his eyes. "Gavilar, Sadeas, and I were wrong to do as we did all those years ago." Wit seemed genuinely surprised. "You unified the kingdom, Dalinar. You did a good work, something that was sorely needed." "This is unity?" Dalinar asked, waving a hand back toward the scattered remnants of the feast, the departing lighteyes. "No, Wit. We failed. We crushed, we killed, and we have failed miserably." He looked up. "I receive, in Alethkar, only what I have demanded. In taking the throne by force, we impliedno we screamedthat strength is the right of rule. If Sadeas thinks he is stronger than I am, then it is his duty to try to take the throne from me. These are the fruits of my youth, Wit. It is why we need more than tyranny, even the benevolent kind, to transform this kingdom. That is what Nohadon was teaching. And that is what I've been missing all along." Wit nodded, looking thoughtful. "I need to read that book of yours again, it seems. I wanted to warn you, however. I'll be leaving soon." "Leave?" Dalinar said. "You only just arrived." "I know. It's incredibly frustrating, I must admit. I have discovered a place that I must be, though to be honest I'm not exactly sure why I need to be there. This doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to." Dalinar frowned at him. Wit smiled back affably. "Are you one of them?" Dalinar asked. "Excuse me?" "A Herald." Wit laughed. "No. Thank you, but no." "Are you what I've been looking for, then?" Dalinar asked. "Radiant?" Wit smiled. "I am but a man, Dalinar, so much as I wish it were not true at times. I am no Radiant. And while I am your friend, please understand that our goals do not completely align. You must not trust yourself with me. If I have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what I need, I will do so. With tears, yes, but I would let it happen." Dalinar frowned. "I will do what I can to help," Wit said, "and for that reason, I must go. I cannot risk too much, because if he finds me, then I become nothinga soul shredded and broken into pieces that cannot be reassembled. What I do here is more dangerous than you could ever know." He turned to go. "Wit," Dalinar called. "Yes?" "If who finds you?" "The one you fight, Dalinar Kholin. The father of hatred." Wit saluted, then jogged off. However, it seems to me that all things have been set up for a purpose, and if weas infantsstumble through the workshop, we risk exacerbating, not preventing, a problem. The Shattered Plains. Kaladin did not claim these lands as he did the chasms, where his men had found safety. Kaladin remembered all too well the pain of bloodied feet on his first run, battered by this broken stone wasteland. Barely anything grew out here, only the occasional patch of rockbuds or set of enterprising vines draping down into a chasm on the leeward side of a plateau. The bottoms of the cracks were clogged with life, but up here it was barren. The aching feet and burning shoulders from running a bridge had been nothing compared to the slaughter that had awaited his men at the end of a bridge run. Storms . . . even looking across the Plains made Kaladin flinch. He could hear the hiss of arrows in the air, the screams of terrified bridgemen, the song of the Parshendi. I should have been able to save more of Bridge Four, Kaladin thought. If I'd been faster to accept my powers, could I have done so? He breathed in Stormlight to reassure himself. Only it didn't come. He stood, dumbfounded, while soldiers marched across one of Dalinar's enormous mechanical bridges. He tried again. Nothing. He fished a sphere from his pouch. The firemark glowed with its customary light, tinting his fingers red. Something was wrong. Kaladin couldn't feel the Stormlight inside as he once had. Syl flitted across the chasm high in the air with a group of windspren. Her giggling laughter rained down upon him, and he looked up. "Syl?" he asked quietly. Storms. He didn't want to look like an idiot, but something deep within him was panicking like a rat caught by its tail. "Syl!" Several marching soldiers glanced at Kaladin, then up toward the air. Kaladin ignored them as Syl zipped down in the form of a ribbon of light. She swirled around him, still giggling. The Stormlight returned to him. He could feel it again, and he greedily sucked it from the spherethough he did have the presence of mind to clutch the sphere in a fist and hold it to his chest to make the process less obvious. The Light of one mark wasn't enough to expose him, but he felt far, far better with that Stormlight raging inside of him. "What happened?" Kaladin whispered to Syl. "Is something wrong with our bond? Is it because I haven't found the Words soon enough?" She landed on his wrist and took the form of a young woman. She peered at his hand, cocking her head. "What's inside?" she asked with a conspiratorial whisper. "You know what this is, Syl," Kaladin said, feeling chilled, as if he'd been hit by a wave of stormwater. "A sphere. Didn't you see it just now?" She looked at him, face innocent. "You are making bad choices. Naughty." Her features mimicked his for a moment and she jumped forward, as if to startle him. She laughed and zipped away. Bad choices. Naughty. So, this was because of his promise to Moash that he'd help assassinate the king. Kaladin sighed, continuing forward. Syl couldn't see why his decision was the right one. She was a spren, and had a stupid, simplistic morality. To be human was often to be forced to choose between distasteful options. Life wasn't clean and neat like she wanted it to be. It was messy, coated with crem. No man walked through life without getting covered in it, not even Dalinar. "You want too much of me," he snapped at her as he reached the other side of the chasm. "I'm not some glorious knight of ancient days. I'm a broken man. Do you hear me, Syl? I'm broken." She zipped up to him and whispered, "That's what they all were, silly." She streaked away. Kaladin watched as the soldiers filed across the bridge. They weren't doing a plateau run, but Dalinar had brought plenty of soldiers anyway. Going out onto the Shattered Plains was entering a war zone, and the Parshendi were ever a threat. Bridge Four tromped across the mechanical bridge, carrying their smaller one. Kaladin wasn't about to leave the camps without that. These mechanisms Dalinar employedthe massive, chullpulled bridges that could be ratcheted down into placewere amazing, but Kaladin didn't trust them. Not nearly as much as he did a good bridge on his shoulders. Syl flitted by again. Did she really expect him to live according to her perception of what was right and wrong? Was she going to yank his powers away every time he did something that risked offending her? That would be like living with a noose around his neck. Determined to not let his worries ruin the day, he went to check on Bridge Four. Look at the open sky, he told himself. Breathe the wind. Enjoy the freedom. After so much time in captivity, these things were wonders. He found Bridge Four beside their bridge at parade rest. It was odd to see them with their old paddedshoulder leather vests on over their new uniforms. It transformed them into a weird mix of what they had been and what they were now. They saluted him together, and he saluted back. "At ease," he told them, and they broke formation, laughing and joking with one another as Lopen and his assistants distributed waterskins. "Ha!" Rock said, settling down on the side of the bridge to drink. "This thing, it is not so hard as I remember it being." "It's because we're going slower," Kaladin said, pointing at Dalinar's mechanical bridge. "And because you're remembering the early days of bridge carries, not the later ones when we were wellfed and welltrained. It got easier then." "No," Rock said. "The bridge is light because we have defeated Sadeas. Is the proper way of things." "That makes no sense." "Ha! Perfect sense." He took a drink. "Airsick lowlander." Kaladin shook his head, but let himself find a smile at Rock's familiar voice. After slaking his own thirst, he jogged across the plateau toward where Dalinar had just finished crossing. Nearby, a tall rock formation surmounted the plateau, and atop it was a wooden structure like a small fort. Sunlight glinted off one of the spyglasses fitted there. No permanent bridge led to this plateau, which was just outside the secure area closest to the warcamp. These scouts positioned here were vaulters, who leaped chasms at narrow points with the use of long poles. It seemed like a job that would require a special brand of crazinessand because of that, Kaladin had always felt respect for these men. One of the vaulters was speaking with Dalinar. Kaladin would have expected the man to be tall and limber, but he was short and compact, with thick forearms. He wore a Kholin uniform with white stripes edging the coat. "We did see something out here, Brightlord," the vaulter said to Dalinar. "I saw it with my own two eyes, and recorded the date and time in glyphs on my ledger. It was a man, a glowing one, who flew around in the sky back and forth over the Plains." Dalinar grunted. "I'm not crazy, sir," the vaulter said, shuffling from one foot to the other. "The other lads saw it too, once I" "I believe you, soldier," Dalinar said. "It was the Assassin in White. He looked like that when he came for the king." The man relaxed. "Brightlord, sir, that's what I thought. Some of the men back at camp told me I was just seeing what I wanted." "Nobody wants to see that one," Dalinar said. "But why would he spend his time out here? Why hasn't he come back to attack, if he's this close?" Kaladin cleared his throat, uncomfortable, and pointed at the watchman's post. "That fort up there, is it wood?" "Yes," the vaulter said, then noticed the knots on Kaladin's shoulders. "Uh, sir." "That can't possibly withstand a highstorm," Kaladin said. "We break it down, sir." "And carry it back to camp?" Kaladin asked, frowning. "Or do you leave it out here for the storm?" "Leave it, sir?" the short man said. "We stay here with it." He pointed toward a burrowedout section of rock, cut with hammers or a Shardblade, at the base of the stone formation. It didn't look very largejust a cubby, really. It looked like they took the wooden floor of the platform up above, then locked it into place with clasps at the side of the cubby to form a kind of door. A special kind of crazy indeed. "Brightlord, sir," the vaulter said to Dalinar, "the one in white might be out here somewhere. Waiting." "Thank you, soldier," Dalinar said, nodding his dismissal. "Keep an eye out for us while we travel. We've had reports of a chasmfiend moving in close to the camps." "Yes, sir," the man said, saluting and then jogging back toward the rope ladder leading up to his post. "What if the assassin does come for you?" Kaladin asked softly. "I don't see how it would be any different out here," Dalinar said. "He'll be back eventually. On the Plains or in the palace, we'll have to fight him." Kaladin grunted. "I wish you'd accept one of those Shardblades that Adolin has been winning, sir. I'd feel more comfortable if you could defend yourself." "I think you'd be surprised," Dalinar said, shading his eyes, turning toward the warcamp. "I do feel wrong leaving Elhokar alone back there, though." "The assassin said he wanted you, sir," Kaladin said. "If you're apart from the king, that will only serve to protect him." "I suppose," Dalinar said. "Unless the assassin's comments were misdirection." He shook his head. "I might order you to stay with him next time. I can't help but feel I'm missing something important, something right in front of me." Kaladin set his jaw, trying to ignore the chill he felt. Order you to stay with him next time. . . . It was almost like fate itself was pushing Kaladin to be in a position to betray the king. "About your imprisonment," the highprince said. "Already forgotten, sir," Kaladin said. Dalinar's part in it, at least. "I appreciate not being demoted." "You're a good soldier," Dalinar said. "Most of the time." His eyes flicked toward Bridge Four, picking up their bridge. One of the men at the side drew his attention in particular: Renarin, wearing his Bridge Four uniform, hefting the bridge into place. Nearby, Leyten laughed and gave him pointers on how to hold the thing. "He's actually starting to fit in, sir," Kaladin said. "The men like him. I never thought I'd see the day." Dalinar nodded. "How was he?" Kaladin asked softly. "After what happened in the arena?" "He refused to go practice with Zahel," Dalinar said. "So far as I know, he hasn't summoned his Shardblade in weeks." He watched for a moment longer. "I can't decide if his time with your men is good for himhelping him think like a soldieror if it's just encouraging him to avoid his greater responsibilities." "Sir," Kaladin said. "If I may say so, your son seems like kind of a misfit. Out of place. Awkward, alone." Dalinar nodded. "Then, I can say with confidence that Bridge Four is probably the best place he could find himself." It felt odd to be saying it of a lighteyes, but it was true. Dalinar grunted. "I'll trust your judgment. Go. Make sure those men of yours are on the watch for the assassin, in case he does come today." Kaladin nodded, leaving the highprince behind. He'd heard about Dalinar's visions beforeand had had an inkling of their contents. He didn't know what he thought, but he intended to get a copy of the vision records in their entirety so he could have Ka read it to him. Perhaps these visions were why Syl was always so determined to trust Dalinar. As the day passed, the army moved across the Plains like the flow of some viscous liquidmud dribbling down a shallow incline. All of this so Shallan could see a chasmfiend chrysalis. Kaladin shook his head, crossing a plateau. Adolin was certainly smitten; he'd managed to roll out an entire strike force, his father included, just to sate the girl's whims. "Walking, Kaladin?" Adolin said, trotting up. The prince rode that white beast of a horse, the thing with the hooves like hammers. Adolin wore his full suit of blue Shardplate, helm tied to a knob on the back of the saddle. "I thought you had full requisition right from my father's stables." "I have full requisition right from the quartermasters too," Kaladin said, "but you don't see me hiking out here with a cauldron on my back just because I can." Adolin chuckled. "You should try riding more. You have to admit that there are advantages. The speed of the gallop, the height of attack." He patted his horse on the neck. "I guess I just trust my own feet too much." Adolin nodded, as if that had been the wisest thing a man had ever said, before riding back to check on Shallan in her palanquin. Feeling a little fatigued, Kaladin fished in his pocket for another sphere, just a diamond chip this time, and held it to his chest. He breathed in. Again, nothing happened. Storm it! He looked about for Syl, but couldn't find her. She'd been so playful lately, he was starting to wonder if this was all some kind of trick. He actually hoped it was that, and not something more. Despite his inward grousing and complaints, he desperately wanted this power. He had claimed the sky, the winds themselves. Giving them up would be like giving up his own hands. He eventually reached the edge of their current plateau, where Dalinar's mechanical bridge was setting up. Here, blessedly, he found Syl inspecting a cremling crawling across the rocks toward the safety of a nearby crack. Kaladin sat down on a rock beside her. "So you're punishing me," he said. "For agreeing to help Moash. That's why I'm having trouble with the Stormlight." Syl followed along behind the cremling, which was a kind of beetle with a round, iridescent shell. "Syl?" Kaladin asked. "Are you all right? You seem . . ." Like you were before. When we first met. It made a feeling of dread rise within him to acknowledge it. If his powers were withdrawing, was it because the bond itself was weakening? She looked up at him, and her eyes became more focused, her expression like that of her normal self. "You have to decide what you want, Kaladin," she said. "You don't like Moash's plan," Kaladin said. "Are you trying to force me to change my mind regarding him?" She scrunched up her face. "I don't want to force you to do anything. You have to do what you think is right." "That's what I'm trying to do!" "No. I don't think you are." "Fine. I'll tell Moash and his friends that I'm out, that I'm not going to help them." "But you gave Moash your word!" "I gave my word to Dalinar too. . . ." She drew her lips to a line, meeting his eyes. "That's the problem, isn't it," Kaladin whispered. "I've made two promises, and I can't keep my word to both." Oh, storms. Was this the sort of thing that had destroyed the Knights Radiant? What happened to your honorspren when you confronted them with a choice like this? A broken vow either way. Idiot, Kaladin thought at himself. It seemed he couldn't make any right choices these days. "What do I do, Syl?" he whispered. She flitted up until she was standing in the air just before him, eyes meeting his. "You must speak the Words." "I don't know them." "Find them." She looked toward the sky. "Find them soon, Kaladin. And no, simply telling Moash you won't help isn't going to work. We've gone too far for that. You need to do what your heart needs to do." She rose upward toward the sky. "Stay with me, Syl," he whispered after her, standing. "I'll figure this out. Just . . . don't lose yourself. Please. I need you." Nearby, gears on Dalinar's bridge mechanism turned as soldiers twisted levers, and the entire thing started to unfold. "Stop, stop, stop!" Shallan Davar jogged up, a flurry of red hair and blue silk, a large floppy hat on her head to keep off the sun. Two of her guards jogged after her, but neither was Gaz. Kaladin spun about, alarmed at her tone, searching for signs of the Assassin in White. Shallan, puffing, raised her safehand to her chest. "Storms, what is wrong with palanquin porters? They absolutely refuse to move quickly. 'It's not stately,' they say. Well, I don't really do stately. All right, give me a minute, then you can continue." She settled down on a rock near the bridge. The baffled soldiers regarded her as she dug out her drawing pad, then started sketching. "All right," she said. "Continue. I've been trying all day to get a progressive sketch of that bridge as it unfolds. Storming porters." What a bizarre woman. The soldiers hesitantly continued positioning the bridge, unfolding it beneath the watchful eyes of three of Dalinar's engineerswidowed wives of his fallen officers. Several carpenters were also on hand to work at their orders if the bridge got stuck or a piece snapped. Kaladin gripped his spear, trying to sort through his emotions regarding Syl, and the promises he'd made. Surely he could work this out somehow. Couldn't he? Seeing this bridge intruded on his mind with thoughts of bridge runs, and he found that a welcome distraction. He could see why Sadeas had preferred the simple, if brutal, method of the bridge crews. Those bridges were faster, cheaper, and less prone to problems. These massive things were ponderous, like big ships trying to maneuver in a bay. Armored bridge runners is the natural solution, Kaladin thought. Men with shields, with full support from the army to get them into position. You could have fast, mobile bridges, but also not leave men to be slaughtered. Of course, Sadeas had wanted the bridgemen killed, as bait to keep arrows away from his soldiers. One of the carpenters helping with the bridgeexamining one of the wooden steadying pins and talking about carving a new onewas familiar to Kaladin. The stout man had a birthmark across his forehead, shaded by the carpenter's cap he wore. Kaladin knew that face. Had the man been one of Dalinar's soldiers, one of those who had lost the will to fight following the slaughter on the Tower? Some of those had switched to other duties in camp. He was distracted as Moash walked over, raising a hand toward Bridge Four, who cheered him. Moash's brilliant Shardplatewhich he'd had repainted blue with red accents at the pointslooked surprisingly natural on him. It hadn't even been a week yet, but Moash walked in the armor easily. He stepped up to Kaladin, then knelt down on one knee, Plate clinking. He saluted, arm across chest. His eyes . . . they were lighter in color; tan instead of deep brown as they'd once been. He wore his Shardblade strapped across his back in a guarded sheath. Only one more day until he had it bonded. "You don't need to salute me, Moash," Kaladin said. "You're lighteyed now. You outrank me by a mile or two." "I'll never outrank you, Kal," Moash said, faceplate of his helm up. "You're my captain. Forever." He grinned. "But I can't tell you how much storming fun it is to watch the lighteyes try to figure out how to deal with me." "Your eyes are really changing." "Yeah," Moash said. "But I'm not one of them, you hear me? I'm one of us. Bridge Four. I'm our . . . secret weapon." "Secret?" Kaladin asked, raising an eyebrow. "They've probably heard about you all the way in Iri by now, Moash. You're the first darkeyed man to be given a Blade and Plate in over a lifetime." Dalinar had even granted Moash lands and a stipend from them, a lavish sum, and not just by bridgeman standards. Moash still stopped by for stew some nights, but not all. He was too busy arranging his new quarters. There was nothing wrong with that. It was natural. It was also part of why Kaladin had turned down the Blade himselfand perhaps why he'd always been worried about showing his powers to the lighteyes. Even if they didn't find a way to take the abilities from himhe knew that fear was irrational, though he felt it all the samethey might find a way to take Bridge Four from him. His men . . . his very self. They might not be the ones who take it from you, Kaladin thought. You might be doing it to yourself, better than any lighteyes could. The thought nauseated him. "We're getting close," Moash said softly as Kaladin took out his waterskin. "Close?" Kaladin asked. He lowered the waterskin and looked over his shoulder across the plateaus. "I thought we still had a few hours to go before we reached the dead chrysalis." It was far out, almost as far out as the armies went on bridge runs. Bethab and Thanadal had claimed it yesterday. "Not that," Moash said, looking to the side. "Other things." "Oh. Moash, are you . . . I mean . . ." "Kal," Moash said. "You're with us, right? You said it." Two promises. Syl told him to follow his heart. "Kaladin," Moash said, more solemnly. "You gave me these Shards, even after you were angry with me for disobeying you. There's a reason. You know, deep down, that what I'm doing is right. It's the only solution." Kaladin nodded. Moash glanced around, then stood up, Plate clinking. He leaned in to whisper. "Don't worry. Graves says you aren't going to have to do much. We just need an opening." Kaladin felt sick. "We can't do it when Dalinar is in the warcamp," he whispered. "I won't risk him being hurt." "No problem," Moash said. "We feel the same way. We'll wait for the right moment. The newest plan is to hit the king with an arrow, so there's no risk of implicating you or anyone else. You lead him to the right spot, and Graves will fell the king with his own bow. He's an excellent shot." An arrow. It felt so cowardly. It needed to be done. It needed to be. Moash patted him on the shoulder, stepping off in his clinking Shardplate. Storms. All Kaladin had to do was lead the king into a specific spot . . . that, and betray Dalinar's trust in him. And if I don't help kill the king, won't I be betraying justice and honor? The king had murderedor as good as murderedmany people, some through indifference, others through incompetence. And storms, Dalinar wasn't innocent either. If he'd been as noble as he pretended, wouldn't he have seen Roshone imprisoned, rather than shipped off somewhere where he "couldn't do any more harm"? Kaladin walked over to the bridge, watching the men march across. Shallan Davar sat primly on a rock, continuing her sketches of the bridge mechanism. Adolin had climbed off his horse and handed it to some grooms for watering. He waved Kaladin over. "Princeling?" Kaladin asked, stepping up. "The assassin has been seen out here," Adolin said. "On the Plains at night." "Yes. I heard the scout telling your father about it." "We need a plan. What if he attacks out here?" "I hope he does." Adolin looked to him, frowning. "From what I saw," Kaladin said, "and from what I've learned about the assassin's initial attack on the old king, he depends on confusion in his victims. He jumps off walls and onto ceilings; he sends men falling the wrong direction. Well, there aren't any walls or ceilings out here." "So he can just fullon fly," Adolin said with a grimace. "Yes," Kaladin said, pointing with a smile, "since we have, what is it, three hundred archers with us?" Kaladin had used his abilities effectively against Parshendi arrows, and so perhaps archers wouldn't be able to kill the assassin. But he imagined it would be hard for the man to fight with wave after wave of arrows flying at him. Adolin nodded slowly. "I'll talk to them, get them ready for the possibility." He started walking toward the bridge, so Kaladin joined him. They passed Shallan, who was still absorbed in her sketching. She didn't even notice Adolin waving at her. Lighteyed women and their diversions. Kaladin shook his head. "Do you know anything about women, bridgeboy?" Adolin asked, looking over his shoulder and watching Shallan as the two of them crossed the bridge. "Lighteyed women?" Kaladin asked. "Nothing. Thankfully." "People think I know a lot about women," Adolin said. "The truth is, I know how to get themhow to make them laugh, how to make them interested. I don't know how to keep them." He hesitated. "I really want to keep this one." "So . . . tell her that, maybe?" Kaladin said, thinking back to Tarah, and the mistakes he'd made. "Do such things work on darkeyed women?" "You're asking the wrong man," Kaladin said. "I haven't had much time for women lately. I was too busy trying to avoid being killed." Adolin seemed to be barely listening. "Perhaps I could say something like that to her. . . . Seems too simple, and she's anything but simple. . . ." He turned back to Kaladin. "Anyway. Assassin in White. We need more of a plan than just telling the archers to be ready." "Do you have any ideas?" Kaladin said. "You won't have a Shardblade, but won't need one, because of . . . you know." "I know?" Kaladin felt a spike of alarm. "Yeah . . . you know." Adolin glanced away and shrugged, as if trying to act nonchalant. "That thing." "What thing?" "The thing . . . with the . . . um, stuff?" He doesn't know, Kaladin realized. He's just fishing, trying to figure out why I can fight so well. And he's doing a really, really bad job of it. Kaladin relaxed, and even found himself smiling at Adolin's awkward attempt. It was nice to feel an emotion other than panic or worry. "I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about." Adolin scowled. "There's something odd about you, bridgeboy," he said. "Admit it." "I admit nothing." "You survived that fall with the assassin," Adolin said. "And at first, I worried you were working with him. Now . . ." "Now what?" "Well, I've decided that whatever you are, you're on my side." Adolin sighed. "Anyway, the assassin. My instincts say the best plan is the one we used when fighting together in the arena. You distract him while I kill him." "That could work, though I worry that he's not the type to let himself get distracted." "Neither was Relis," Adolin said. "We'll do it, bridgeboy. You and I. We're going to bring that monster down." "We'll need to be fast," Kaladin said. "He'll win a drawnout fight. And Adolin, strike for the spine or the head. Don't try a weakening blow first. Go right for the kill." Adolin frowned at him. "Why?" "I saw something when the two of us fell together," Kaladin said. "I cut him, but he healed the wound somehow." "I have a Blade. He won't be able to heal from that . . . right?" "Best to not find out. Strike to kill. Trust me." Adolin met his eyes. "Oddly, I do. Trust you, I mean. It's a very strange sensation." "Yeah, well, I'll try to hold myself back from going skipping across the plateau in joy." Adolin grinned. "I'd pay to see that." "Me skipping?" "You happy," Adolin said, laughing. "You've got a face like a storm! I half think you could frighten off a storm." Kaladin grunted. Adolin laughed again, slapping him on the shoulder, then turned as Shallan finally crossed the bridge, her sketching apparently done. She looked to Adolin fondly, and as he reached out to take her hand, she rose up on her toes and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Adolin drew back, startled. Alethi were more reserved than that in public. Shallan grinned at him. Then she turned and gasped, raising a hand to her mouth. Kaladin jumped, again, looking for dangerbut Shallan just went dashing off to a nearby clump of rocks. Adolin raised his hand to his cheek, then looked to Kaladin with a grin. "She probably saw an interesting bug." "No, it's moss!" Shallan called back. "Ah, of course," Adolin said, strolling over, Kaladin following. "Moss. So exciting." "Hush, you," Shallan said, wagging her pencil at him as she bent down, inspecting the rocks. "The moss grows in a strange pattern here. What could cause that?" "Alcohol," Adolin said. She glanced at him. He shrugged. "Makes me do crazy things." He looked at Kaladin, who shook his head. "That was funny," Adolin said. "It was a joke! Well, kind of." "Oh hush," Shallan said. "This looks almost like the same pattern as a flowering rockbud, the kind common here on the Plains. . . ." She started sketching. Kaladin folded his arms. Then he sighed. "What does that sigh mean?" Adolin asked him. "Boredom," Kaladin said, glancing back at the army, still crossing the bridge. With a force of three thousandthat was about half of Dalinar's current army, following heavy recruitmentmoving out here took time. On bridge runs, these crossings had felt so quick. Kaladin had always been exhausted, savoring the chance to rest. "I guess out here, it's so barren that there's not much to get excited about other than moss." "You hush too," Shallan told him. "Go polish your bridge or something." She leaned in, then poked her pencil at a bug that was crawling across the moss. "Ah . . ." she said, then hurriedly scribbled some notes. "Anyway, you're wrong. There's a lot out here to get excited about, if you look in the right places. Some of the soldiers said a chasmfiend has been spotted. Do you think it might attack us?" "You sound entirely too hopeful saying that, Shallan," Adolin said. "Well, I do still need a good sketch of one." "We'll get you to the chrysalis. That will have to be enough." Shallan's scholarship was an excuse; the truth was obvious to Kaladin. Dalinar had brought an unusual number of scouts with him today, and Kaladin suspected once they reached the chrysaliswhich was on the border of unexplored lands they'd range ahead and gather information. This was all preparation for Dalinar's expedition. "I don't understand why we need so many soldiers," Shallan said, noticing Kaladin's gaze as he studied the army. "Didn't you say the Parshendi haven't been showing up to fight over chrysalises lately?" "No, they haven't," Adolin said. "That's precisely what makes us worried." Kaladin nodded. "Whenever your enemy changes established tactics, you need to worry. It could mean they're getting desperate. Desperation is very, very dangerous." "You're good at military thinking, for a bridgeboy," Adolin said. "Coincidentally," Kaladin said, "you're good at not being unobnoxious, for a prince." "Thanks," Adolin said. "That was an insult, dear," Shallan said. "What?" Adolin said. "It was?" She nodded, still sketching, though she glanced up to eye Kaladin. He met the expression calmly. "Adolin," Shallan said, turning back to the small rock formation in front of her, "would you slay this moss for me, please?" "Slay . . . the moss." He looked at Kaladin, who just shrugged. How was he to know what a lighteyed woman meant? They were a strange breed. "Yes," Shallan said, standing up. "Give that moss, and the rock behind it, a good chop. As a favor for your betrothed." Adolin looked baffled, but he did as she asked, summoning his Shardblade and hacking at the moss and rock. The top of the small pile of stones slipped free, cut with ease, and clattered to the floor of the plateau. Shallan stepped up eagerly, crouching down beside the perfectly flat top of the sliced stone. "Mmm," she said, nodding to herself. She started sketching. Adolin dismissed his Blade. "Women!" he said, shrugging at Kaladin. Then he went jogging off to get a drink without asking her for an explanation. Kaladin took a step after him, but then hesitated. What did Shallan find so interesting here? This woman was a puzzle, and he knew he wouldn't be completely comfortable until he understood her. She had too much access to Adolin, and therefore Dalinar, to leave uninvestigated. He stepped closer, looking over her shoulder as she drew. "Strata," he said. "You're counting the strata of crem to guess how old the rock is." "Good guess," she said, "but this is a bad location for strata dating. The wind blows across the plateaus too strongly, and the crem doesn't collect in pools evenly. So the strata here are erratic and inaccurate." Kaladin frowned, narrowing his eyes. The cross section of rock was normal cremstone on the outside, some strata visible as different shades of brown. The center of the stone, though, was white. You didn't see white rock like that often; it had to be quarried. Which meant this was either a very strange occurrence, or . . . "There was a structure here once," Kaladin said. "A long time ago. It must have taken centuries for the crem to get that thick on something sticking out of the ground." She glanced at him. "You're smarter than you look." Then, turning back to her drawing, she added, "Good thing . . ." He grunted. "Why does everything you say have to include some quip? Are you that desperate to prove how clever you are?" "Perhaps I'm merely annoyed at you for taking advantage of Adolin." "Advantage?" Kaladin asked. "Because I called him obnoxious?" "You deliberately said it in a way you expected he wouldn't understand. To make him look like a fool. He's trying very hard to be nice to you." "Yes," Kaladin said. "He's always so munificent to all of the little darkeyes who flock around to worship him." Shallan snapped her pencil against the page. "You really are a hateful man, aren't you? Underneath the mock boredom, the dangerous glares, the growls you just hate people, is that it?" "What? No, I" "Adolin is trying. He feels bad for what happened to you, and he's doing what he can to make up for it. He is a good man. Is it too much for you to stop provoking him?" "He calls me bridgeboy," Kaladin said, feeling stubborn. "He's been provoking me." "Yes, because he is the one storming around with alternating scowls and insults," Shallan said. "Adolin Kholin, the most difficult man to get along with on the Shattered Plains. I mean look at him! He's so unlikable!" She gestured with the pencil toward where Adolin was laughing with the darkeyed water boys. The groom walked up with Adolin's horse, and Adolin took his Shardplate helm off the carrying post, handing it over, letting one of the water boys try it on. It was ridiculously large on the lad. Kaladin flushed as the boy took a Shardbearer's pose, and they all laughed again. Kaladin looked back to Shallan, who folded her arms, drawing pad resting on the flattopped cut rock before her. She smirked at him. Insufferable woman. Bah! Kaladin left her and hiked across the rough ground to join Bridge Four, where he insisted on taking a turn hauling the bridge, despite Teft's protests that he was "above that sort of thing" now. He was no storming lighteyes. He'd never be above doing an honest day's work. The familiar weight of the bridge settled onto his shoulders. Rock was right. It did feel lighter than it once had. He smiled as he heard cursing from Lopen's cousins, wholike Renarinwere being initiated on this run into their first bridge carry. They hiked the bridge over a chasmcrossing on one of Dalinar's larger, less mobile onesand started across the plateau. For a time, marching at the front of Bridge Four, Kaladin could imagine that his life was simple. No plateau assaults, no arrows, no assassins or bodyguarding. Just him, his team, and a bridge. Unfortunately, as they neared the other side of the large plateau, he started to feel weary andby reflextried to suck in some Stormlight to bolster him. It wouldn't come. Life was not simple. It never had been, certainly not while running bridges. To pretend otherwise was to paint over the past. He helped set the bridge down, thennoticing the vanguard moving out in front of the armyhe and the bridgemen shoved their bridge into place across the chasm. The vanguard cheerfully welcomed the chance to get ahead, marching over the bridge and securing the next plateau. Kaladin and the others followed, thena half hour laterthey let the vanguard onto the next plateau. They continued like that for a time, waiting for Dalinar's bridge to arrive before crossing, then leading the vanguard onto the next plateau. Hours passedsweaty, musclestraining hours. Good hours. Kaladin didn't come to any realizations about the king, or his place in the man's potential assassination. But for the moment, he carried his bridge and enjoyed the progress of an army moving toward their goal beneath an open sky. As the day grew long, they approached the target plateau, where the hollowedout chrysalis awaited Shallan's study. Kaladin and Bridge Four let the vanguard across as they'd been doing, then settled in to wait. Eventually, the bulk of the army approached, and Dalinar's lumbering bridges moved into position, ratcheting down to span the chasm. Kaladin gulped deeply of warm water as he watched. He washed his face with the water, then wiped his brow. They were getting close. This plateau was far out onto the Plains, almost to the Tower itself. Getting back would take hours, assuming they moved at the same relaxed speed they had taken getting out here. It would be well after dark when they returned to the warcamps. If Dalinar does want to assault the center of the Shattered Plains, Kaladin thought, it will take days of marching, all the while exposed on the plateaus, with the potential of being surrounded and cut off from the warcamps. The Weeping would make a great chance for that. Four straight weeks of rain, but no highstorms. This was the off year, when there wouldn't even be a highstorm on Lightday in the middlepart of the thousandday cycle of two years that made up a full storm rotation. Still, he knew that many Alethi patrols had tried exploring eastward before. They'd all been destroyed by highstorms, chasmfiends, or Parshendi assault teams. Nothing short of an allout, fullon movement of resources toward the center would work. An assault that would leave Dalinar, and whoever came with him, isolated. Dalinar's bridge thumped down into place. Kaladin's men traversed their own bridge and prepared to pull it across to go move the vanguard. Kaladin crossed, then waved them on ahead of him. He walked over to where the larger bridge had settled down. Dalinar was crossing it while walking with some of his scouts, all vaulters, with servants behind carrying long poles. "I want you to spread out," the highprince said to them. "We won't have much time before we need to head back. I want a survey of as many plateaus as you can see from here. The more of our route we can plan now, the less time we'll have to waste during the actual assault." The scouts nodded, saluting as he dismissed them. He stepped off the bridge and nodded to Kaladin. Behind them, Dalinar's generals, scribes, and engineers crossed the bridge. They'd be followed by the bulk of the army, and finally the rearguard. "I hear you've been building mobile bridges, sir," Kaladin said. "You realize those mechanical ones are too slow for your assault, I assume." Dalinar nodded. "But I will have soldiers carry them. No need for your men to do so." "Sir, that is thoughtful of you, but I don't think you have to worry. The bridge crews will carry for you, if ordered. Many of them will probably welcome the familiarity." "I thought you and your men considered assignment to those bridge crews a death sentence, soldier," Dalinar said. "The way Sadeas ran them, it was. You could do a better job. Armored men, trained in formations, running the bridges. Soldiers marching in front with shields. Archers with instructions to defend the bridge crews. Besides, the danger is only for an assault." Dalinar nodded. "Prepare the crews, then. Having your men on the bridges will free the soldiers in case we get attacked." He started to walk across the plateau, but one of the carpenters on the other side of the chasm called to him. Dalinar turned and started to cross the bridge again. He passed officers and scribes crossing the bridge, including Adolin and Shallan, who walked side by side. She'd given up on the palanquin and he had given up on his horse, and she seemed to be explaining to him about the hidden remnants of a structure she'd found inside that rock earlier. Behind them, on the other side of the chasm, stood the worker who had called Dalinar back across. It's that same carpenter, Kaladin thought. The stout man with the cap and the birthmark. Where have I seen him . . . ? It clicked. Sadeas's lumberyards. The man had been one of the carpenters there, overseeing the construction of bridges. Kaladin started running. He was charging toward the bridge before the connection fully solidified in his mind. Ahead of him, Adolin spun immediately and started running, searching for whatever danger Kaladin had spotted. He left a bewildered Shallan standing in the bridge's center. Kaladin approached her in a rush. The carpenter grabbed a lever on the side of the bridge contraption. "The carpenter, Adolin!" Kaladin screamed. "Stop that man!" Dalinar still stood on the bridge. The highprince had been distracted by something else. What? Kaladin realized he had heard something too. Horns, the call that the enemy had been spotted. It happened all in an instant. Dalinar turning toward the horns. The carpenter pulling the lever, Adolin in his glimmering Shardplate reaching Dalinar. The bridge lurched. Then it collapsed. Rayse is captive. He cannot leave the system he now inhabits. His destructive potential is, therefore, inhibited. As the bridge fell out from beneath him, Kaladin reached for Stormlight. Nothing. Panic surged through him. His stomach dropped and he tumbled into the air. The fall into the darkness of the chasm was a brief moment, but also an eternity. He caught a glimpse of Shallan and several men in blue uniforms falling and flailing in terror. Like a drowning man struggling toward the surface, Kaladin thrashed for the Stormlight. He would not die this way! The sky was his! The winds were his. The chasms were his. He would not! Syl screamed, a terrified, painful sound that vibrated Kaladin's very bones. In that moment, he got a breath of Stormlight, life itself. He crashed into the ground at the bottom of the chasm and all went black. * * * Swimming through pain. The pain washed over him, a liquid, but did not get inside. His skin kept it out. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? The distant voice sounded like rumbling thunder. Kaladin gasped and opened his eyes, and the pain crawled inside. Suddenly, his entire body hurt. He lay on his back, staring upward at a streak of light in the air. Syl? No . . . no, that was sunlight. The opening at the top of the chasm, high above him. This far out onto the Shattered Plains, the chasms here were hundreds of feet deep. Kaladin groaned and sat up. That strip of light seemed impossibly distant. He'd been swallowed by the darkness, and the chasm nearby was shadowed, obscure. He put a hand to his head. I got some Stormlight right at the end, he thought. I survived. But that scream! It haunted him, echoing in his mind. It had sounded too much like the scream he'd heard when touching the duelist's Shardblade in the arena. Check for wounds, his father's teachings whispered from the back of his mind. The body could go into shock with a bad break or wound, and not notice the damage that had been done. He went through the motions of checking his limbs for breaks, and did not reach for any of the spheres in his pouch. He didn't want to light the gloom, and potentially face the dead around him. Was Dalinar among them? Adolin had been running toward his father. Had the prince managed to get to Dalinar before the bridge collapsed? He'd been wearing Plate, and had jumped at the end. Kaladin felt at his legs, then his ribs. He found aches and scrapes, but nothing broken or ripped. That Stormlight he'd held at the end . . . it had protected him, perhaps even healed him, before running out. He finally reached into his pouch and fished out spheres, but found those all drained. He tried his pocket, then froze as he heard something scraping nearby. He leaped to his feet and spun, wishing he had a weapon. The chasm bottom grew brighter. A steady glow revealed fanlike frillblooms and draping vines on the walls, gathered twigs and moss on the floor in patches. Was that a voice? He felt a surreal moment of confusion as shadows moved on the wall ahead of him. Then someone wandered around the corner, wearing a silk dress and carrying a pack over her shoulder. Shallan Davar. She screamed when she saw him, throwing the pack to the ground and stumbling backward, hands to her sides. She even dropped her sphere. Rolling his arm in its socket, Kaladin stepped closer into the light. "Calm down," he said. "It's me." "Stormfather!" Shallan said, scrambling to grab the sphere off the ground again. She stepped forward, thrusting the light toward him. "It is you . . . the bridgeman. How . . . ?" "I don't know," he lied, looking upward. "I've got a wicked crick in my neck and my elbow hurts like thunder. What happened?" "Someone threw the emergency latch on the bridge." "What emergency latch?" "It topples the bridge into the chasm." "Sounds like a storming stupid thing to have," Kaladin said, fishing in his pocket for his other spheres. He glanced at them covertly. Also drained. Storms. He'd used them all? "Depends," Shallan said. "What if your men have retreated over the bridge and enemies are pouring across it after you? The emergency latch is supposed to have some kind of safety lock so it can't be thrown by accident, but you can release it in a hurry if you need to." He grunted as Shallan shone her sphere past him toward where the two halves of the bridge had smashed into the ground of the chasm. There were the bodies he'd expected. He looked. He had to. No sign of Dalinar, though several of the officers and lighteyed ladies who had been crossing the bridge lay in twisted, broken heaps on the ground. A drop of two hundred feet or more did not leave survivors. Except Shallan. Kaladin didn't remember grabbing her as he fell, but he didn't remember much of that fall beyond Syl's scream. That scream . . . Well, he must have managed to grab Shallan by reflex, infusing her with Stormlight to slow her fall. She looked disheveled, her blue dress scuffed and her hair a mess, but she was apparently otherwise unharmed. "I woke up down here in the darkness," Shallan said. "It's been a while since we fell." "How can you tell?" "It's almost dark up there," Shallan said. "It will be night soon. When I woke I heard echoes of yelling. Fighting. I saw something glowing from around that corner. Turned out to be a soldier who had fallen, his sphere pouch ripped." She shivered visibly. "He'd been killed by something before the fall." "Parshendi," Kaladin said. "Just before the bridge collapsed, I heard horns from the vanguard. We got attacked." Damnation. That probably meant that Dalinar had retreated, assuming he'd actually survived. There was nothing worth fighting for out here. "Give me one of those spheres," Kaladin said. She handed one over, and Kaladin went searching among the fallen. For pulses, ostensibly, but really for any equipment or spheres. "You think any of these might be alive?" Shallan asked, voice sounding small in the otherwise silent chasm. "Well, we survived somehow." "How do you think that happened?" Shallan said, looking upward toward the gap far, far above. "I saw some windspren just before we fell," Kaladin said. "I've heard folktales of them protecting a person as he falls. Perhaps that's what happened." Shallan went silent as he searched the bodies. "Yes," she finally said. "That sounds logical." She seemed convinced. Good. So long as she didn't start wondering about the stories told of "Kaladin Stormblessed." Nobody else was alive, but he verified for certain that neither Dalinar nor Adolin were among the corpses. I was a fool not to spot that an assassination attempt was coming, Kaladin thought. Sadeas had tried hard to undermine Dalinar at the feast a few days back, with the revelation of the visions. It was a classic ploy. Discredit your enemy, then kill him, to make certain he didn't become a martyr. The corpses had little of value. A handful of spheres, some writing implements that Shallan greedily snatched up and stuffed into her satchel. No maps. Kaladin had no specific idea where they were. And with night imminent . . . "What do we do?" Shallan asked softly, staring at the darkened realm, with its unexpected shadows, its gently moving frills, vines, polyplike staccatos, their tendrils out and wafting in the air. Kaladin remembered his first times down in this place, which always felt too green, too muggy, too alien. Nearby, two skulls peeked out from beneath the moss, watching. Splashing sounded from a distant pool, which made Shallan spin wildly. Though the chasms were a home to Kaladin now, he did not deny that at times they were distinctly unnerving. "It's safer down here than it seems," Kaladin said. "During my time in Sadeas's army, I spent days upon days in the chasms, gathering salvage from the fallen. Just watch for rotspren." "And the chasmfiends?" Shallan asked, spinning to look in another direction as a cremling scuttled along the wall. "I never saw one." Which was true, though he had seen a shadow of one once, scraping its way down a distant chasm. Even thinking of that day gave him chills. "They aren't as common as people claim. The real danger is highstorms. You see, if it rains, even far away from here" "Yes, flash flooding," Shallan said. "Very dangerous in a slot canyon. I've read about them." "I'm sure that will be very helpful," Kaladin said. "You mentioned some dead soldiers nearby?" She pointed, and he strode in that direction. She followed, sticking close to his light. He found a few dead spearmen who had been shoved off the plateau above. The wounds were fresh. Just beyond them was a dead Parshendi, also fresh. The Parshendi man had uncut gems in his beard. Kaladin touched one, hesitated, then tried to draw the Stormlight out. Nothing happened. He sighed, then bowed his head for the fallen, before finally pulling a spear from underneath one of the bodies and standing up. The light above had faded to a deep blue. Night. "So, we wait?" Shallan asked. "For what?" Kaladin asked, raising the spear to his shoulder. "For them to come back . . ." She trailed off. "They're not coming back for us, are they?" "They'll assume we're dead. Storms, we should be dead. We're too far out for a corpserecovery operation, I'd guess. That's doubly true since the Parshendi attacked." He rubbed his chin. "I suppose we could wait for Dalinar's major expedition. He was indicating he'd come this way, searching for the center. It's only a few days away, right?" Shallan paled. Well, she paled further. That light skin of hers was so strange. It and the red hair made her look like a very small Horneater. "Dalinar is planning to march just after the final highstorm before the Weeping. That storm is close. And it will involve lots, and lots, and lots of rain." "Bad idea, then." "You could say so." He'd tried to imagine what a highstorm would be like down here. He had seen the aftereffects when salvaging with Bridge Four. The twisted, broken corpses. The piles of refuse crushed against walls and into cracks. Boulders as tall as a man casually washed through chasms until they got wedged between two walls, sometimes fifty feet up in the air. "When?" he asked. "When is that highstorm?" She stared at him, then dug into her satchel, flipping through sheets of paper with her freehand while holding the satchel through the fabric of her safehand. She waved him over with his sphere, as she had to tuck hers away. He held it up for her as she looked over a page with lines of script. "Tomorrow night," she said softly. "Just after first moonset." Kaladin grunted, holding up his sphere and inspecting the chasm. We're just to the north of the chasm we fell from, he thought. So the way back should be . . . that way? "All right then," Shallan said. She took a deep breath, then snapped her satchel closed. "We walk back, and we start immediately." "You don't want to sit for a moment and catch your breath?" "My breath is quite well caught," Shallan said. "If it's all the same to you, I'd rather be moving. Once back, we can sit sipping mulled wine and laugh about how silly it was of us to hurry all that way, since we had so much time to spare. I'd like very much to feel that foolish. You?" "Yeah." He liked the chasms. It didn't mean he wanted to risk a highstorm in one of them. "You don't have a map in that satchel, do you?" "No," Shallan said with a grimace. "I didn't bring my own. Brightness Velat has the maps. I was using hers. But I might be able to remember some of what I've seen." "Then I think we should go this way," Kaladin said, pointing. He started walking. * * * The bridgeman started walking off in the direction he'd pointed, not even giving her a chance to state her opinion on the matter. Shallan kept a huff to herself, snatching up her packshe'd found some waterskins on the soldiersand satchel. She hurried after him, her dress catching on something she hoped was a very white stick. The tall bridgeman deftly stepped over and around debris, eyes forward. Why did he have to be the one who survived? Though to be honest, she was pleased to find anyone. Walking down here alone would not have been pleasant. At least he was superstitious enough to believe that he'd been saved by some twist of fate and spren. She had no idea how she'd saved herself, let alone him. Pattern rode on her skirts, and before she'd found the bridgeman, he'd been speculating that the Stormlight had kept her alive. Alive after a fall of at least two hundred feet? It only proved how little she knew about her abilities. Stormfather! She'd saved this man too. She was sure of it; he'd been falling right beside her as they plummeted. But how? And could she figure out how to do it again? She hurried to keep up with him. Blasted Alethi and their freakishly long legs. He marched like a soldier, giving no thought to how she had to pick her way more carefully than he did. She didn't want to get her skirt caught on every branch they passed. They reached a pool of water on the chasm floor, and he hopped up onto a log that bridged the water, barely breaking stride as he crossed. She stopped at the edge. He looked back at her, holding up a sphere. "You aren't going to demand I give you my boots again, are you?" She raised a foot, revealing the militarystyle boots she wore underneath her dress. That got him to cock an eyebrow. "I wasn't about to come out onto the Shattered Plains in slippers," she said, blushing. "Besides, nobody can see your shoes under a dress this long." She regarded the log. "You want me to help you across?" he asked. "Actually, I'm wondering how the trunk of a stumpweight tree got here," she confessed. "They can't possibly be native to this area of the Shattered Plains. Too cold out here. It might have grown along the coast, but a highstorm really carried it that far? Four hundred miles?" "You're not going to demand we stop for you to sketch a picture, are you?" "Oh please," Shallan said, stepping up onto the log and picking her way across. "Do you know how many sketches I have of stumpweights?" The other things down here were a different matter entirely. As they continued on their way, Shallan used her spherewhich she had to juggle in her freehand, trying to manage it along with the satchel in her safehand and the pack over her shoulderto illuminate her surroundings. They were stunning. Dozens of different varieties of vines, frillblooms of red, orange, and violet. Tiny rockbuds on the walls, and haspers in little clusters, opening and closing their shells as if breathing. Motes of lifespren drifted around a patch of shalebark that grew in knobby patterns like fingers. You almost never saw that formation above. The tiny glowing specks of green light drifted through the chasm toward an entire wall of fistsize tube plants with little feelers wiggling out the top. As Shallan passed, the feelers retracted in a wave running up the wall. She gasped softly and took a Memory. The bridgeman stopped ahead of her, turning. "Well?" "Don't you even notice how beautiful it is?" He looked up at the wall of tube plants. She was certain she'd read about those somewhere, but the name escaped her. The bridgeman continued on his way. Shallan jogged after him, pack thumping against her back. She almost tripped over a snarled pile of dead vines and sticks as she reached him. She cursed, hopping on one foot to stay upright before steadying herself. He reached out and took the pack from her. Finally, she thought. "Thank you." He grunted, slipping it over his shoulder before continuing on without another word. They reached a crossroads in the chasms, a path going right and another going left. They'd have to weave around the next plateau before them to continue westward. Shallan looked up at the riftgetting a good picture in her mind of how this side of the plateau lookedas Kaladin chose one of the paths. "This is going to take a while," he said. "Even longer than it took to get out here. We had to wait upon the whole army then, but we could also cut through the centers of the plateaus. Having to go around every one of them will add a lot to the trip." "Well, at least the companionship is pleasant." He eyed her. "For you, I mean," she added. "Am I going to have to listen to you prattle all the way back?" "Of course not," she said. "I also intend to do some blathering, a little nattering, and the occasional gibber. But not too much, lest I overdo a good thing." "Great." "I've been practicing my burble," she added. "I just can't wait to hear." "Oh, well, that was it, actually." He studied her, those severe eyes of his boring into her own. She turned away from him. He didn't trust her, obviously. He was a bodyguard; she doubted that he trusted many people. They reached another intersection, and Kaladin took longer to make this decision. She could see whydown here, it was difficult to determine which way was which. The plateau formations were varied and erratic. Some were long and thin, others almost perfectly round. They had knobs and peninsulas off to their sides, and that made a maze of the twisted paths between them. It should have been easythere were few dead ends, after all, and so they really just had to keep moving westward. But which direction was westward? It would be very, very easy to get lost down here. "You're not picking our course at random, are you?" she asked. "No." "You seem to know a lot about these chasms." "I do." "Because the gloomy atmosphere matches your disposition, I assume." He kept his eyes forward, walking without comment. "Storms," she said, hurrying to catch up. "That was supposed to be lighthearted. What would it take to make you relax, bridgeboy?" "I guess I'm just a . . . what was it again? A 'hateful man'?" "I haven't seen any proof to the contrary." "That's because you don't care to look, lighteyes. Everyone beneath you is just a plaything." "What?" she said, taking it like a slap to the face. "Where would you get that idea?" "It's obvious." "To whom? To you only? When have you seen me treat someone of a lesser station like a plaything? Give me one example." "When I was imprisoned," he said immediately, "for doing what any lighteyes would have been applauded for doing." "And that was my fault?" she demanded. "It's the fault of your entire class. Each time one of us is defrauded, enslaved, beaten, or broken, the blame rests upon all of you who support it. Even indirectly." "Oh please," she said. "The world isn't fair? What a huge revelation! Some people in power abuse those they have power over? Amazing! When did this start happening?" He gave no reply. He'd tied his spheres to the top of his spear with a pouch formed from the white handkerchief he'd found on one of the scribes. Held high, it lit the chasm nicely for them. "I think," she said, tucking away her own sphere for convenience, "that you're just looking for excuses. Yes, you've been mistreated. I admit it. But I think you're the one who cares about eye color, that it's just easier for you to pretend that every lighteyes is abusing you because of your status. Have you ever asked yourself if there's a simpler explanation? Could it be that people don't like you, not because you're darkeyed, but because you're just a huge pain in the neck?" He snorted, then moved on more quickly. "No," Shallan said, practically running to keep even with him and his long stride. "You're not wiggling out of this. You don't get to imply that I'm abusing my station, then walk off without a response. You did this earlier, with Adolin. Now with me. What is your problem?" "You want a better example of you playing with people beneath you?" Kaladin asked, dodging her question. "Fine. You stole my boots. You pretended to be someone you weren't and bullied a darkeyed guard you'd barely met. Is that a good enough example of you playing with someone you saw as beneath you?" She stopped in her tracks. He was right, there. She wanted to blame Tyn's influence, but his comment cut the bite out of her argument. He stopped ahead of her, looking back. Finally, he sighed. "Look," he said. "I'm not holding a grudge about the boots. From what I've seen lately, you're not as bad as the others. So let's just leave it at that." "Not as bad as the others?" Shallan said, walking forward. "What a delightful compliment. Well, let's say you're right. Perhaps I am an insensitive rich woman. That doesn't change the fact that you can be downright mean and offensive, Kaladin Stormblessed." He shrugged. "That's it?" she asked. "I apologize, and all I get in return is a shrug?" "I am what the lighteyes have made me to be." "So you're not culpable at all," she said flatly. "For the way you act." "I'd say not." "Stormfather. I can't say anything to change the way you treat me, can I? You're just going to continue to be an intolerant, odious man, full of spite. Incapable of being pleasant around others. Your life must be very lonely." That seemed to get under his skin, as his face turned red in the spherelight. "I'm starting to revise my opinion," he said, "of you not being as bad as the others." "Don't lie," she said. "You've never liked me. Right from the start. And not just because of the boots. I see how you watch me." "That's because," he said, "I know you're lying through your smile at everyone you meet. The only time you seem honest is when you're insulting someone!" "The only honest things I can say to you are insults." "Bah!" he said. "I just . . . Bah! Why is it that being around you makes me want to claw my face off, woman?" "I have special training," she said, glancing to the side. "And I collect faces." What was that? "You can't just" He cut off as the scraping noise, echoing from one of the chasms, grew louder. Kaladin immediately put his hand over his improvised sphere lantern, plunging them into darkness. In Shallan's estimation, that did not help. She stumbled toward him in the darkness, grabbing his arm with her freehand. He was annoying, but he was also there. The scraping continued. A sound like rock on rock. Or . . . carapace on rock. "I guess," she whispered nervously, "having a shouting match in an echoing network of chasms was not terribly wise." "Yeah." "It's getting closer, isn't it?" she whispered. "Yeah." "So . . . run?" The scraping seemed just beyond the next turn. "Yeah," Kaladin said, pulling his hand off his spheres and charging away from the noise. Whether this was Tanavast's design or not, millennia have passed without Rayse taking the life of another of the sixteen. While I mourn for the great suffering Rayse has caused, I do not believe we could hope for a better outcome than this. Kaladin scrambled down the chasm, leaping branches and refuse, splashing through puddles. The girl kept up better than he'd expected, buthampered by her dressshe was nowhere near as swift as he was. He held himself back, matching her pace. Exasperating though she might be, he wasn't going to abandon Adolin's betrothed to be eaten by a chasmfiend. They reached an intersection and chose a path at random. At the next intersection, he only paused long enough to check to see if they were being followed. They were. Thumping from behind them, claws on stone. Scraping. He grabbed the girl's satchelhe was already carrying her packas they ran down another corridor. Either Shallan was in excellent shape, or the panic got to her, because she didn't even seem winded when they reached the next intersection. No time for hesitation. He barreled down a pathway, ears full of the sound of grinding carapace. A sudden fourvoiced trump echoed through the chasm, as loud as a thousand horns being blown. Shallan screamed, though Kaladin barely heard her over the horrible sound. The chasm plants withdrew in large waves. In moments, the entire place went from fecund to barren, like the world preparing for a highstorm. They hit another intersection, and Shallan hesitated, looking back toward the sounds. She held her hands out, as if preparing to embrace the thing. Storming woman! He grabbed her and pulled her after him. They ran down two chasms without stopping. It was still chasing, though he could only hear it. He had no idea how close it was, but it had their scent. Or their sound? He had no idea how they hunted. Need a plan! Can't just At the next intersection, Shallan turned the opposite way from the one he had picked. Kaladin cursed, pounding to a stop and running after her. "This is no time," he said, puffing, "to argue about" "Shut it," she said. "Follow." She led them to an intersection, then another. Kaladin was feeling winded, his lungs protesting. Shallan stopped, then pointed and ran down a chasm. He followed, looking over his shoulder. He could see only blackness. Moonlight was too distant, too choked, to illuminate these depths. They wouldn't know if the beast was upon them until it entered the light of his spheres. But Stormfather, it sounded close. Kaladin turned his attention back to his running. He nearly tripped over something on the ground. A corpse? He leaped it, catching up to Shallan. The hem of her dress was snarled and ripped from the running, her hair a mess, her face flushed. She led them down another corridor, then slowed to a stop, hand to the wall of the chasm, puffing. Kaladin closed his eyes, breathing in and out. Can't rest long. It will be coming. He felt as if he were going to collapse. "Cover that light," Shallan hissed. He frowned at her, but did so. "We can't rest long," he hissed back. "Quiet." The darkness was complete save for the thin light escaping between his fingers. The scraping seemed almost on top of them. Storms! Could he fight one of these monsters? Without Stormlight? Desperate, he tried to suck in the Light he held in his palm. No Stormlight came, and he hadn't seen Syl since the fall. The scraping continued. He prepared to run, but . . . The sounds didn't seem to be getting closer anymore. Kaladin frowned. The body he'd stumbled over, it had been one of the fallen from the fight earlier. Shallan had led them back to where they'd started. And . . . to food for the beast. He waited, tense, listening to his heartbeat thumping in his chest. Scraping echoed in the chasm. Oddly, some light flashed in the chasm behind. What was that? "Stay here," Shallan whispered. Then, incredibly, she started to move toward the sounds. Still holding the spheres awkwardly with one hand, he reached out with the other and snatched her. She turned back to him, then looked down. Inadvertently, he'd grabbed her by the safehand. He let go immediately. "I have to see it," Shallan whispered to him. "We're so close." "Are you insane?" "Probably." She continued toward the beast. Kaladin debated, cursing her in his mind. Finally, he put his spear down and dropped her pack and satchel over its spheres to muffle the light. Then he followed. What else could he do? Explain to Adolin? Yes, princeling. I let your betrothed wander off alone in the darkness to get eaten by a chasmfiend. No, I didn't go with her. Yes, I'm a coward. There was light ahead. It showed Shallanher outline, at leastcrouching beside a turn in the chasm, peeking around. Kaladin stepped up to her, crouching down and taking a look. There it was. The beast filled the chasm. Long and narrow, it wasn't bulbous or bulky, like some small cremlings. It was sinuous, sleek, with that arrowlike face and sharp mandibles. It was also wrong. Wrong in a way difficult to describe. Big creatures were supposed to be slow and docile, like chulls. Yet this enormous beast moved with ease, its legs up on the sides of the chasm, holding it so that its body barely touched the ground. It ate the corpse of a fallen soldier, grasping the body in smaller claws by its mouth, then ripping it in half with a gruesome bite. That face was like something from a nightmare. Evil, powerful, almost intelligent. "Those spren," Shallan whispered, so soft he could barely hear. "I've seen those . . ." They danced around the chasmfiend, and were the source of the light. They looked like small glowing arrows, and they surrounded the beast in schools, though occasionally one would drift away from the others and then vanish like a small plume of smoke rising into the air. "Skyeels," Shallan whispered. "They follow skyeels too. The chasmfiend likes corpses. Could its kind be carrion feeders by nature? No, those claws, they look like they're meant for breaking shells. I suspect we'd find herds of wild chulls near where these things live naturally. But they come to the Shattered Plains to pupate, and here there's very little food, which is why they attack men. Why has this one remained after pupating?" The chasmfiend was almost done with its meal. Kaladin took her by the shoulder, and she allowed himwith obvious reluctanceto pull her away. They returned to their things, gathered them up, andas silently as possible retreated farther into the darkness. * * * They walked for hours, going in a completely different direction from the one they'd taken before. Shallan allowed Kaladin to lead again, though she tried her best to keep track of the chasms. She'd need to draw it out to be certain of their location. Images of the chasmfiend tumbled in her head. What a majestic animal! Her fingers practically itched to sketch it from the Memory she'd taken. The legs were larger than she'd imagined; not like a legger, with spindly little spinelike legs holding up a thick body. This creature had exuded power. Like the whitespine, only enormous and more alien. They were far from it now. Hopefully that meant they were safe. The night was dragging on her, after she'd risen early to get moving on the expedition. She covertly checked the spheres in her pouch. She'd drained them all dun in their flight. Bless the Almighty for the Stormlightshe would need to make a glyphward in thanks. Without the strength and endurance it lent, she'd never have been able to keep up with Kaladin longlegs. Now, however, she was storming exhausted. As if the Light had inflated her capacity, but now left her deflated and worn out. At the next intersection, Kaladin paused and looked her over. She gave him a weak smile. "We'll need to stop for the night," he said. "Sorry." "It's not just you," he said, looking up at the sky. "I honestly have no idea if we're going the right direction or not. I'm all turned around. If we can get an idea in the morning of where the sun is rising, it will tell us which direction to walk." She nodded. "We should still be able to get back in plenty of time," he added. "No need to worry." The way he said it immediately made her start worrying. Still, she helped him find a relatively dry portion of ground, and they settled down, spheres in the center like a little mock fire. Kaladin dug in the pack she'd foundshe'd taken it off a dead soldierand came out with some rations of flatbread and dried chull jerky. Not the most appetizing of food by any stretch, but it was something. She sat with her back to the wall and ate, looking upward. The flatbread was from Soulcast grainthat stale taste was obvious. Clouds above prevented her from seeing the stars, but some starspren moved in front of those, forming distant patterns. "It's strange," she whispered as Kaladin ate. "I've only been down here half a night, but it feels like so much longer. The tops of the plateaus seem so distant, don't they?" He grunted. "Ah yes," she said. "The bridgeman grunt. A language unto itself. I'll need to go over the morphemes and tones with you; I'm not quite fluent yet." "You'd make a terrible bridgeman." "Too short?" "Well, yes. And too female. I doubt you'd look good in the traditional short trousers and open vest. Or, rather, you'd probably look too good. It might be a little distracting for the other bridgemen." She smiled at that, digging into her satchel and pulling out her sketchbook and pencils. At least she had fallen with those. She started sketching, humming softly to herself and stealing one of the spheres for light. Pattern still lay on her skirts, content to be silent in Kaladin's presence. "Storms," Kaladin said. "You're not drawing a picture of you wearing one of those outfits . . ." "Yes, of course," she said. "I'm drawing salacious pictures of myself for you after only a few hours together in the chasm." She scratched at a line. "You have quite the imagination, bridgeboy." "Well it's what we were talking about," he grumbled, rising and walking over to look at what she was doing. "I thought you were tired." "I'm exhausted," she said. "So I need to relax." Obviously. This first sketch wouldn't be the chasmfiend. She needed a warmup. So she drew their path through the chasms. A map, kind of, but more a picture of the chasms as if she could see them from above. It was imaginative enough to be interesting, though she was certain she got a few of the ridges and corners wrong. "What is that?" Kaladin asked. "A picture of the Plains?" "Something of a map," she said, though she grimaced. What did it say about her that she couldn't just draw a few lines giving their location, like a regular person? She had to do it like a picture. "I don't know the full shapes of the plateaus we walked around, just the chasm pathways we used." "You remember it that well?" Stormwinds. Hadn't she intended to keep her visual memory more secret than this? "Uh . . . No, not really. I'm guessing at a lot of this." She felt foolish for revealing her skill. Veil would have had words with her. It was too bad Veil wasn't down here, actually. She would be better at this whole survivinginthewilderness thing. Kaladin took the picture from her fingers, standing up and using his sphere to light it. "Well, if your map is correct, we've been making our way southward instead of westward. I need light to navigate better." "Perhaps," she said, taking out another sheet to begin her sketch of the chasmfiend. "We'll wait for the sun tomorrow," he said. "That will tell me which way to go." She nodded, beginning her sketch as he made a place for himself and settled down, coat folded into a pillow. She wanted to turn in herself, but this sketch would not wait. She at least had to get something down. She only lasted about a half hourfinishing perhaps a quarter of the sketch before she had to put it away, curl up on the hard ground with the pack as a pillow, and fall asleep. * * * It was still dark when Kaladin nudged her awake with the butt of his spear. Shallan groaned, rolling over on the chasm floor, and drowsily tried to put her pillow over her head. Which, of course, spilled dried chull meat onto her. Kaladin chuckled. Sure, that got a laugh out of him. Storming man. How long had she been able to sleep? She blinked bleary eyes and focused on the open crack of the chasm far above. Nope, not a single glimmer of light. Two, perhaps three hours of sleep, then? Or, rather, "sleep." The definition of what she'd done was debatable. She'd probably have called it "tossing and turning on the rocky ground, occasionally waking with a start to find that she'd drooled a small puddle." That didn't really roll off the tongue, though. Unlike the aforementioned drool. She sat up and stretched sore limbs, checking to make sure her sleeve hadn't come unbuttoned in the night or anything equally embarrassing. "I need a bath," she grumbled. "A bath?" Kaladin asked. "You have only been away from civilization for one day." She sniffed. "Just because you're accustomed to the stench of unwashed bridgeman does not mean I need to join in." He smirked, taking a piece of dried chull meat from her shoulder and popping it in his mouth. "In my home town growing up, bath day was once a week. I think even the local lighteyes would have found it strange that everyone out here, even the common soldiers, finds a bath more frequently." How dare he be this chipper in the morning? Or, rather, the "morning." She threw another piece of chull meat at him when he wasn't looking. The storming man caught it. I hate him. "We didn't get eaten by that chasmfiend while we slept," he said, refilling the pack save for a single waterskin. "I'd say that was about as much a blessing as we could expect, under the circumstances. Come on, up on your toes. Your map gives me an idea of which way to go, and we can watch for sunlight to make certain we're on the right path. We want to beat that highstorm, right?" "You're the one I want to beat," she grumbled. "With a stick." "What was that?" "Nothing," she said, standing up and trying to make something of her frazzled hair. Storms. She must look like the aftereffect of a lightning bolt hitting a jar of red ink. She sighed. She didn't have a brush, and he didn't look like he was going to give her time for a proper braid, so she put on her bootswearing the same pair of socks two days in a row was the least of her indignitiesand picked up her satchel. Kaladin carried the pack. She trailed after him as he led the way through the chasm, her stomach complaining about how little she'd eaten the night before. Food didn't sound good, so she let it growl. Serves it right, she thought. Whatever that meant. Eventually, the sky did start to brighten, and from a direction that indicated that they were going the right way. Kaladin fell into his customary quiet, and his chipper mien from earlier in the morning evaporated. Instead, he looked like he was consumed by difficult thoughts. She yawned, pulling up beside him. "What are you thinking about?" "I was considering how nice it was to have a little silence," he said. "With nobody bothering me." "Liar. Why do you try so hard to put people off?" "Maybe I just don't want to have another argument." "You won't," she said, yawning again. "It's far too early for arguments. Try it. Give me an insult." "I don't" "Insult! Now!" "I'd rather walk these chasms with a compulsive murderer than you. At least then, when the conversation got tedious, I'd have an easy way out." "And your feet stink," she said. "See? Too early. I can't possibly be witty at this hour. So no arguments." She hesitated, then continued more softly. "Besides, no murderer would agree to accompany you. Everyone needs to have some standards, after all." Kaladin snorted, lips tugging up to the sides. "Be careful," she said, hopping over a fallen log. "That was almost like a smileand earlier this morning, I could swear that you were cheerful. Well, mildly content. Anyway, if you start to be in a better mood, it will destroy the whole variety of this trip." "Variety?" he asked. "Yes. If we're both pleasant, there's no artistry to it. You see, great art is a matter of contrast. Some lights and some darks. The happy, smiling, radiant lady and the dark, brooding, malodorous bridgeman." "That" He stopped. "Malodorous?" "A great figure painting," she said, "shows the hero with inherent contrast strong, yet hinting at vulnerability, so that the viewer can relate to him. Your little problem would make for a dynamic contrast." "How would you even convey that in a painting?" Kaladin said, frowning. "Besides, I'm not malodorous." "Oh, so you're getting better? Yay!" He looked at her, dumbfounded. "Confusion," she said. "I will graciously take that as a sign that you're amazed that I can be so humorous at such an early hour." She leaned in conspiratorially, whispering. "I'm really not very witty. You just happen to be stupid, so it seems that way. Contrast, remember?" She smiled at him, then continued on her way, humming to herself. Actually, the day was looking much better. Why had she been in a bad mood earlier? Kaladin jogged to catch up with her. "Storms, woman," he said. "I don't know what to make of you." "Preferably not a corpse." "I'm surprised someone hasn't already done that." He shook his head. "Give me an honest answer. Why are you here?" "Well, there was this bridge that collapsed, and I fell . . ." He sighed. "Sorry," Shallan said. "Something about you encourages me to crack wise, bridgeboy. Even in the morning. Anyway, why did I come here? You mean to the Shattered Plains in the first place?" He nodded. There was a sort of rugged handsomeness to the fellow. Like the beauty of a natural rock formation, as opposed to a fine sculpture like Adolin. But Kaladin's intensity, that frightened her. He seemed like a man who constantly had his teeth clenched, a man who couldn't let himselfor anyone elsejust sit down and take a nice rest. "I came here," Shallan said, "because of Jasnah Kholin's work. The scholarship she left behind must not be abandoned." "And Adolin?" "Adolin is a delightful surprise." They passed an entire wall covered in draping vines that were rooted in a broken section of rock above. They wriggled and pulled up as Shallan passed. Very alert, she noted. Faster than most vines. These were the opposite of those in the gardens back home, where the plants had been sheltered for so long. She tried to snatch one for a cutting, but it moved too quickly. Drat. She needed a bit of one so that when they got back, she could grow a plant for experimentation. Pretending she was here to explore and record new species helped push back the gloom. She heard Pattern humming softly from her skirt, as if he realized what she was doing, distracting herself from the predicament and the danger. She swatted at him. What would the bridgeman think if he heard her clothing buzz? "Just a moment," she said, finally snatching one of the vines. Kaladin watched, leaning on his spear, as she cut the tip off the vine with the small knife from her satchel. "Jasnah's research," he said. "It had something to do with structures hidden out here, beneath the crem?" "What makes you say that?" She tucked the tip of the vine away in an empty ink jar she'd kept for specimens. "You made too much of an effort to get out here," he said. "Ostensibly all to investigate a chasmfiend's chrysalis. A dead one, even. There has to be more." "You don't understand the compulsive nature of scholarship, I see." She shook the jar. He snorted. "If you'd really wanted to see a chrysalis, you could have just had them tow one back for you. They have those chull sleds for the wounded; one of those might have worked. There was no need for you to come all the way out here yourself." Blast. A solid argument. It was a good thing Adolin hadn't thought of that. The prince was wonderful, and he certainly wasn't stupid, but he was also . . . mentally direct. This bridgeman was proving himself different. The way he watched her, the way he thought. Even, she realized, the way he spoke. He talked like an educated lighteyes. But what of those slave brands on his forehead? The hair got in the way, but she thought that one of them was a shash brand. Perhaps she should spend as much time wondering about this man's motives as he apparently fretted about hers. "Riches," he said, as they continued on. He held back some dead branches sticking from a crack so she could pass. "There's a treasure of some sort out here, and that's what you seek? But . . . no. You could have wealth easily enough by marriage." She didn't say anything, stepping through the gap he made for her. "Nobody had heard of you before this," he continued. "The Davar house really does have a daughter your age, and you match the description. You could be an impostor, but you're actually lighteyed, and that Veden house isn't particularly significant. If you were going to bother to impersonate someone, wouldn't you pick someone more important?" "You seem to have thought about this a great deal." "It's my job." "I'm being truthful with youJasnah's research is why I came to the Shattered Plains. I think the world itself could be in danger." "That's why you talked to Adolin about the parshmen." "Wait. How do you . . . Your guards were there on that terrace with us. They told you? I didn't realize they were close enough to listen." "I made a point of telling them to stay close," Kaladin said. "At the time, I was half convinced you were here to assassinate Adolin." Well, he was nothing if not honest. And blunt. "My men said," Kaladin continued, "that you seemed to want to get the parshmen murdered." "I said nothing of the sort," she said. "Though I am worried that they might betray us. It's a moot point, as I doubt I'll persuade the highprinces without more evidence." "If you got your way, though," Kaladin said, sounding curious, "what would you do? About the parshmen." "Have them exiled," Shallan said. "And who will replace them?" Kaladin said. "Darkeyes?" "I'm not saying it would be easy," Shallan said. "They'd need more slaves," Kaladin said, contemplative. "A lot of honest men might find themselves with brands." "Still sore about what happened to you, I assume." "Wouldn't you be?" "Yes, I suppose I would. I am sorry that you were treated in such a way, but it could have been worse. You could have been hanged." "I wouldn't have wanted to be the executioner who tried that." He said it with a quiet intensity. "Me neither," Shallan said. "I think hanging people is a poor choice of professions for an executioner. Better to be the guy with an axe." He frowned at her. "You see," she said, "with the axe, it's easier to get ahead. . . ." He stared. Then, after a moment, he winced. "Oh, storms. That was awful." "No, it was funny. You seem to get those two mixed up a lot. Don't worry. I'm here to help." He shook his head. "It's not that you aren't witty, Shallan. I just feel like you try too hard. The world is not a sunny place, and frantically trying to turn everything into a joke is not going to change that." "Technically," she said, "it is a sunny place. Half the time." "To people like you, perhaps," Kaladin said. "What does that mean?" He grimaced. "Look, I don't want to fight again, all right? I just . . . Please. Let's let the topic drop." "What if I promise not to get angry?" "Are you capable of that?" "Of course. I spend most of my time not being angry. I'm terribly proficient at it. Most of those times aren't around you, granted, but I think I'll be all right." "You're doing it again," he said. "Sorry." They walked in silence for a moment, passing plants in bloom with a shockingly wellpreserved skeleton underneath them, somehow barely disturbed by the flowing of water in the chasm. "All right," Kaladin said. "Here it is. I can imagine how the world must appear to someone like you. Growing up pampered, with everything you want. To someone like you, life is wonderful and sunny and worth laughing over. That's not your fault, and I shouldn't blame you. You haven't had to deal with pain or death like I have. Sorrow is not your companion." Silence. Shallan didn't reply. How could she reply to that? "What?" Kaladin finally asked. "I'm trying to decide how to react," Shallan said. "You see, you just said something very, very funny." "Then why aren't you laughing?" "Well, it isn't that kind of funny." She handed him her satchel and stepped onto a small dry rise of rock running through the middle of a deep pond on the chasm floor. The ground was usually flatall of that crem settlingbut the water in this pool looked a good two or three feet deep. She crossed with hands out to the sides, balancing. "So, let me see," she said as she stepped carefully. "You think I've lived a simple, happy life full of sunshine and joy. But you also imply that I've got dark, evil secrets, so you're suspicious of and even hostile to me. You tell me I'm arrogant and assume that I consider darkeyes to be playthings, but when I tell you what I'm trying to do to protect themand everyone elseyou imply I'm meddling and should just leave well enough alone." She reached the other side and turned about. "Would you say that's an accurate summary of our conversations up to this point, Kaladin Stormblessed?" He grimaced. "Yes. I suppose." "Wow," she said, "you sure do seem to know me well. Particularly considering that you started this conversation by professing that you don't know what to make of me. An odd statement from someone who seems, from my perspective, to have figured it all out. Next time I'm trying to decide what to do, I'll just ask you, since you appear to understand me better than I understand myself." He crossed the same ridge of rock in the path, and she watched anxiously, as he was carrying her satchel. She trusted him better with it over the water than she trusted herself, though. She reached for it when he arrived on the other side, but found herself taking his arm to draw his attention. "How about this?" she said, holding his eyes. "I promise, solemnly and by the tenth name of the Almighty, that I mean no harm to Adolin or his family. I mean to prevent a disaster. I might be wrong, and I might be misguided, but I vow to you that I'm sincere." He stared into her eyes. So intense. She felt a shiver meeting that expression. This was a man of passion. "I believe you," he said. "And I guess that will do." He looked upward, then cursed. "What?" she asked, looking toward the distant light above. The sun was peeking out over the lip of the ridge there. The wrong ridge. They weren't going west any longer. They'd strayed again, pointing southward. "Blast," Shallan said. "Give me that satchel. I need to draw this out." He bears the weight of God's own divine hatred, separated from the virtues that gave it context. He is what we made him to be, old friend. And that is what he, unfortunately, wished to become. "I was young," Teft said, "so I didn't hear much. Kelek, I didn't want to hear much. The things my family did, they weren't the sort of things you want your parents doing, all right? I didn't want to know. So it's not surprising I can't remember." Sigzil nodded in that mild, yet infuriating way of his. The Azish man just knew things. And he made you tell him things too. Unfair, that was. Terribly. Why did Teft have to end up with him on watch duty? The two sat on rocks near the chasms just east of Dalinar's warcamp. A cold wind blew in. Highstorm tonight. He'll be back before then. Surely by then. A cremling scuttled past. Teft threw a rock at it, driving it toward a nearby crack. "I don't know why you want to hear all of these things anyway. They aren't any use." Sigzil nodded. Storming foreigner. "All right, fine," Teft said. "It was some kind of cult, you see, called the Envisagers. They . . . well, they thought if they could find a way to return the Voidbringers, then the Knights Radiant would return as well. Stupid, right? Only, they knew things. Things they shouldn't, things like what Kaladin can do." "I see this is hard for you," Sigzil said. "Want to play another hand of michim to pass the time instead?" "You just want my storming spheres," Teft snapped, wagging his finger at the Azish man. "And don't call it by that name." "Michim is the game's actual name." "That's a holy word, and ain't no game named a holy word." "The word isn't holy where it came from," Sigzil said, obviously annoyed. "We ain't there now, are we? Call it something else." "I thought you'd like it," Sigzil said, picking up the colored rocks that were used in the game. You bet them, in a pile, while trying to guess the ones your opponent had hidden. "It's a game of skill, not chance, so it doesn't offend Vorin sensibilities." Teft watched him pick up the rocks. Maybe it would be better if he just lost all of his spheres in that storming game. It wasn't good for him to have money again. He couldn't be trusted with money. "They thought," Teft said, "that people were more likely to manifest powers if their lives were in danger. So . . . they'd put lives in danger. Members of their own groupnever an innocent outsider, bless the winds. But that was bad enough. I watched people let themselves be pushed off cliffs, watched them tied in place with a candle slowly burning a rope until it snapped and dropped a rock to crush them. It was bad, Sigzil. Awful. The sort of thing nobody should have to watch, especially a boy of six." "So what did you do?" Sigzil asked softly, pulling tight the string on his little bag of rocks. "Ain't none of your business," Teft said. "Don't know why I'm even talking to you." "It's all right," Sigzil said. "I can see" "I turned them in," Teft blurted out. "To the citylord. He held a trial for them, a big one. Had them all executed in the end. Never did understand that. They were only a danger to themselves. Their punishment for threatening suicide was to be killed. Nonsense, that is. Should have found a way to help them . . ." "Your parents?" "Mother died in that rockstring contraption," Teft said. "She really believed, Sig. That she had it in her, you know? The powers? That if she were about to die, they'd come out in her, and she'd save herself . . ." "And you watched?" "Storms, no! You think they'd let her son watch that? Are you mad?" "But" "Did watch my father die, though," Teft said, looking out over the Plains. "Hanged." He shook his head, digging in his pocket. Where had he put that flask? As he turned, however, he caught sight of that other lad sitting back there, fiddling with his little box as he often did. Renarin. Teft wasn't one for all that nonsense like Moash had talked about, wanting to overturn lighteyes. The Almighty had put them in their place, and who had business questioning him? Not spearmen, that's for certain. But in a way, Prince Renarin was as bad as Moash. Neither one knew their place. A lighteyes wanting to join Bridge Four was as bad as a darkeyes talking stupid and lofty to the king. It didn't fit, even if the other bridgemen seemed to like the lad. And, of course, Moash was one of them now. Storms. Had he left his flask back at the barrack? "Heads up, Teft," Sigzil said, rising. Teft turned around and saw men in uniform approaching. He scrambled to his feet, grabbing his spear. It was Dalinar Kholin, accompanied by several of his lighteyed advisors, along with Drehy and Skar from Bridge Four, the day's guards. With Moash promoted away and Kaladin . . . well, not there . . . Teft had taken over daily assignments. Nobody else would storming do it. They said he was in command now. Idiots. "Brightlord," Teft said, slapping his chest in salute. "Adolin told me you men were coming here," the highprince said. He spared a glance for Prince Renarin, who had also stood and saluted, as if this weren't his own father. "A rotation, I understand?" "Yes, sir," Teft said, looking toward Sigzil. It was a rotation. Teft was just on nearly every shift. "You really think he's alive out there, soldier?" Dalinar asked. "He is, sir," Teft said. "It's not about what I or anyone thinks." "He fell hundreds of feet," Dalinar said. Teft continued to stand at attention. The highprince hadn't asked a question, so Teft didn't give a reply. He did have to banish a few terrible images in his head. Kaladin having knocked his head while falling. Kaladin having been crushed by the falling bridge. Kaladin lying with a broken leg, unable to find spheres to heal himself. The fool boy thought he was immortal, sometimes. Kelek. They all thought he was. "He is going to come back, sir," Sigzil said to Dalinar. "He's going to come climbing right up out of that chasm right there. It will be well if we're here to meet him. Uniforms on, spears polished." "We wait on our own time, sir," Teft said. "Neither of us three are supposed to be anywhere else." He blushed as soon as he said it. And here he'd been thinking about how Moash talked back to his betters. "I didn't come to order you away from your chosen task, soldier," Dalinar said. "I came to make certain you were caring for yourselves. No men are to skip meals to wait here, and I don't want you getting any ideas about waiting during a highstorm." "Er, yes, sir," Teft said. He had used his morning meal break to put in duty here. How had Dalinar known? "Good luck, soldier," Dalinar said, then continued on his way, flanked by attendants, apparently off to inspect the battalion that was nearest to the eastern edge of camp. Soldiers there scurried like cremlings after a storm, carrying supply bags and piling them inside their barracks. The time for Dalinar's full expedition onto the Plains was quickly approaching. "Sir," Teft called after the highprince. Dalinar turned back toward him, his attendants pausing midsentence. "You don't believe us," Teft said. "That he'll come back, I mean." "He's dead, soldier. But I understand that you need to be here anyway." The highprince touched his hand to his shoulder, a salute to the dead, then continued on his way. Well, Teft supposed that was all right, Dalinar not believing. He'd just be that much more surprised when Kaladin did return. Highstorm tonight, Teft thought, settling back down on his rock. Come on, lad. What are you doing out there? * * * Kaladin felt like one of the ten fools. Actually, he felt like all of them. Ten times an idiot. But most specifically Eshu, who spoke of things he did not understand in front of those who did. Navigation this deep in the chasms was hard, but he could usually read directions by the way that the debris was deposited. Water blew in from the east to the west, but then it drained out the other wayso cracks on walls where debris was smashed in tight usually marked a western direction, but places where debris had been deposited more naturallyas water drainedmarked where water had flowed east. His instincts told him which way to go. They'd been wrong. He shouldn't have been so confident. This far from the warcamps, the waterflows must be different. Annoyed at himself, he left Shallan drawing and walked out a ways. "Syl?" he asked. No response. "Sylphrena!" he said, louder. He sighed and walked back to Shallan, who knelt on the mossy ground she'd obviously given up on protecting the oncefine dress from stains and rips drawing on her sketchpad. She was another reason he felt like a fool. He shouldn't let her provoke him so. He could hold in the retorts against other, far more annoying lighteyes. Why did he lose control when talking with her? Should have learned my lesson, he thought as she sketched, her expression growing intense. She's won every argument so far, hands down. He leaned against a section of the chasm wall, spear in the crook of his arm, light shining from the spheres tied tightly at its head. He had made invalid assumptions about her, as she had so poignantly noted. Again and again. It was like a part of him frantically wanted to dislike her. If only he could find Syl. Everything would be better if he could see her again, if he could know that she was all right. That scream . . . To distract himself, he moved over to Shallan, then leaned down to see her sketch. Her map was more of a picture, one that looked eerily like the view Kaladin had had, nights ago, when flying above the Shattered Plains. "Is all that necessary?" he asked as she shaded in the sides of a plateau. "Yes." "But" "Yes." It took longer than he'd have preferred. The sun passed through the crack overhead, vanishing from sight. Already past noon. They had seven hours until the highstorm, assuming the timing prediction was righteven the best stormwardens got the calculations wrong sometimes. Seven hours. The hike out here, he thought, took about that long. But surely they'd made some progress toward the warcamps. They'd been walking all morning. Well, no use rushing Shallan. He left her to it, walking back along the chasm, looking up at the shape of the rift up above and comparing it to her drawing. From what he could see, her map was dead on. She was drawing, from memory, their entire path as if seen from aboveand she did it perfectly, every little knob and ledge accounted for. "Stormfather," he whispered, jogging back. He'd known she had skill in drawing, but this was something entirely different. Who was this woman? She was still drawing when he arrived. "Your picture is amazingly accurate," he said. "I may have . . . underplayed my skill a little last night," Shallan said. "I can remember things pretty well, though to be honest, I didn't realize how far off our path was until I drew it. A lot of these plateau shapes are unfamiliar to me; we might be into the areas that haven't been mapped yet." He looked to her. "You remember the shapes of all of the plateaus on the maps?" "Uh . . . yes?" "That's incredible." She sat back on her knees, holding up her sketch. She brushed aside an unruly lock of red hair. "Maybe not. Something's very odd here." "What?" "I think my sketch must be off." She stood up, looking troubled. "I need more information. I'm going to walk around one of the plateaus here." "All right . . ." She started walking, still focused on her sketch, barely paying attention to where she was going as she stumbled over rocks and sticks. He kept up with ease, but didn't bother her as she turned her eyes toward the rift ahead. She walked them all the way around the base of the plateau to their right. It took a painfully long time, even walking quickly. They were losing minutes. Did she know where they were or not? "Now that plateau," she said, pointing to the next wall. She began walking around the base of that plateau. "Shallan," Kaladin said. "We don't have" "This is important." "So is not getting crushed in a highstorm." "If we don't find out where we are, we won't ever escape," she said, handing him the sheet of paper. "Wait here. I'll be right back." She jogged off, skirt swishing. Kaladin stared at the paper, inspecting the path she'd drawn. Though they'd started the morning going the right way, it was as he'd fearedKaladin had eventually wound them around until they were going directly south again. He'd even somehow turned them back going east for a while! That put them even farther from Dalinar's camp than when they'd begun the night before. Please let her be wrong, he thought, going around the plateau the other direction to meet her halfway. But if she was wrong, they wouldn't know where they were at all. Which option was worse? He got a short distance down the chasm before freezing. The walls here were scraped free of moss, the debris on the floor pushed around and scratched. Storms, this was fresh. Since the last highstorm at least. The chasmfiend had come this way. Maybe . . . maybe it had gone past on its way farther out into the chasms. Shallan, distracted and muttering to herself, appeared around the other side of the plateau. She walked, still staring at the sky, muttering to herself. ". . . I know I said that I saw these patterns, but this is too grand a scale for me to know instinctively. You should have said something. I" She cut off abruptly, jumping as she saw Kaladin. He found himself narrowing his eyes. That had sounded like . . . Don't be silly. She's no warrior. The Knights Radiant had been soldiers, hadn't they? He didn't really know much about them. Still, Syl had seen several strange spren about. Shallan gave a glance to the wall of the chasm and the scrapes. "Is that what I think it is?" "Yeah," he said. "Delightful. Here, give me that paper." He handed it back and she slipped a pencil out of her sleeve. He gave her the satchel, which she set on the floor, using the stiff side as a place to sketch. She filled in the two plateaus closest to them, the ones she'd walked around to get a full view. "So is your drawing off or not?" Kaladin asked. "It's accurate," Shallan said as she drew, "it's just strange. From my memory of the maps, this set of plateaus nearest to us should be farther to the north. There is another group of them up there that are exactly the same shape, only mirrored." "You can remember the maps that well?" "Yes." He didn't press further. From what he'd seen, maybe she could do just that. She shook her head. "What are the chances that a series of plateaus would take the exact same shape as those on another part of the Plains? Not just one, but an entire sequence . . ." "The Plains are symmetrical," Kaladin said. She froze. "How do you know that?" "I . . . it was a dream. I saw the plateaus arrayed in a wide symmetrical formation." She looked back at her map, then gasped. She began scribbling notes on the side. "Cymatics." "What?" "I know where the Parshendi are." Her eyes widened. "And the Oathgate. The center of the Shattered Plains. I can see it allI can map almost the entire thing." He shivered. "You . . . what?" She looked up sharply, meeting his eyes. "We have to get back." "Yes, I know. The highstorm." "More than that," she said, standing. "I know too much now to die out here. The Shattered Plains are a pattern. This isn't a natural rock formation." Her eyes widened further. "At the center of these Plains was a city. Something broke it apart. A weapon . . . Vibrations? Like sand on a plate? An earthquake that could break rock . . . Stone became sand, and at the blowing of the highstorms, the cracks full of sand were hollowed out." Her eyes seemed eerily distant, and Kaladin didn't understand half of what she'd said. "We need to reach the center," Shallan said. "I can find it, the heart of these Plains, by following the pattern. And there will be . . . things there . . ." "The secret you're searching for," Kaladin said. What had she said just earlier? "Oathgate?" She blushed deeply. "Let's keep moving. Didn't you mention how little time we had? Honestly, if one of us weren't chatting away all the time and distracting everyone, I'm half certain we'd be back already." He cocked an eyebrow at her, and she grinned, then pointed the direction for them to go. "I'm leading now, by the way." "Probably for the best." "Though," she said, "as I consider, it might be better to let you lead. That way, we might find our way to the center by accident. Assuming we don't end up in Azir." He gave her a chuckle at that because it seemed the right thing to do. Inside, however, it ripped him apart. He'd failed. The next few hours were excruciating. After walking the length of two plateaus, Shallan had to stop and update her map. It was correct to do sothey couldn't risk getting off track again. It just took so much time. Even moving as quickly as they could between drawing sessions, practically running the entire way, their progress was too slow. Kaladin shuffled from foot to foot, watching the sky as Shallan filled in her map again. She cursed and grumbled, and he noticed her brushing away a drop of sweat that had fallen from her brow onto the increasingly crumpled paper. Maybe four hours left until the storm, Kaladin thought. We aren't going to make it. "I'll try for scouts again," he said. Shallan nodded. They had entered the territory where Dalinar's polewielding scouts watched for new chrysalises. Shouting to them was a slim hopeeven if they were lucky enough to find one of those groups, he doubted they had enough rope handy to reach to the bottom of the chasm. But it was a chance. So he moved awayso as to not disturb her drawing cupped his mouth, and began shouting. "Hello! Please reply! We're trapped in the chasms! Please reply!" He walked for a time, shouting, then stopped to listen. Nothing came back. No questioning shouts echoing down from above, no signs of life. They've probably all withdrawn into their cubbies by now, Kaladin thought. They've broken down their watchposts and are waiting for the highstorm. He stared up with frustration at that slot of attenuated sky. So distant. He remembered this feeling, being down here with Teft and the others, longing to climb out and escape the horrible life of a bridgeman. For the hundredth time, he tried drawing in the Stormlight of those spheres. He clutched the sphere until his hand and the glass were sweaty, but the Stormlightthe power withindid not flow to him. He couldn't feel the Light anymore. "Syl!" he yelled, tucking away the sphere, cupping his hands around his mouth. "Syl! Please! Are you there, anywhere . . . ?" He trailed off. "I still don't know," he said more softly. "Is this a punishment? Or is it something more? What is wrong?" No reply. Surely if she were watching him, she wouldn't let him die down here. Assuming she could think to notice. He had a horrible image of her riding the winds, mingling with the windspren, having forgotten herself and him becoming terribly, blissfully ignorant of what she truly was. She'd feared that. She'd been terrified of it. Shallan's boots scratched the ground as she walked up. "No luck?" He shook his head. "Well, onward, then." She took a deep breath. "Through soreness and exhaustion we go. You wouldn't be willing to carry me a little ways . . ." He glared at her. She shrugged with a smile. "Think how grand it would be! I could even get a reed to whip you with. You'd be able to go back and tell all the other guards what an awful person I am. It'll be a wonderful opportunity for griping. No? Well, all right then. Off we go." "You're a strange woman." "Thank you." He fell into step beside her. "My," she noted, "you've brewed another storm over your head, I see." "I've killed us," he whispered. "I took the lead, and I got us lost." "Well, I didn't notice we were going the wrong way either. I wouldn't have done any better." "I should have thought to have you map our progress from the start today. I was too confident." "It's done," she said. "If I'd been more clear with you about how well I could draw these plateaus, then you'd probably have made better use of my maps. I didn't, and you didn't know, so here we are. You can't blame yourself for everything, right?" He walked in silence. "Uh, right?" "It's my fault." She rolled her eyes exaggeratedly. "You are really intent on beating yourself up, aren't you?" His father had said the same thing time and time again. It was who Kaladin was. Did they expect him to change? "We'll be fine," Shallan said. "You'll see." That darkened his mood further. "You still think I'm too optimistic, don't you?" Shallan said. "It's not your fault," Kaladin said. "I'd rather be like you. I'd rather not have lived the life I have. I would that the world was only full of people like you, Shallan Davar." "People who don't understand pain." "Oh, all people understand pain," Kaladin said. "That's not what I'm talking about. It's . . ." "The sorrow," Shallan said softly, "of watching a life crumble? Of struggling to grab it and hold on, but feeling hope become stringy sinew and blood beneath your fingers as everything collapses?" "Yes." "The sensationit's not sorrow, but something deeperof being broken. Of being crushed so often, and so hatefully, that emotion becomes something you can only wish for. If only you could cry, because then you'd feel something. Instead, you feel nothing. Just . . . haze and smoke inside. Like you're already dead." He stopped in the chasm. She turned and looked to him. "The crushing guilt," she said, "of being powerless. Of wishing they'd hurt you instead of those around you. Of screaming and scrambling and hating as those you love are ruined, popped like a boil. And you have to watch their joy seeping away while you can't do anything. They break the ones you love, and not you. And you plead. Can't you just beat me instead?" "Yes," he whispered. Shallan nodded, holding his eyes. "Yes. It would be nice if nobody in the world knew of those things, Kaladin Stormblessed. I agree. With everything I have." He saw it in her eyes. The anguish, the frustration. The terrible nothing that clawed inside and sought to smother her. She knew. It was there, inside. She had been broken. Then she smiled. Oh, storms. She smiled anyway. It was the single most beautiful thing he'd seen in his entire life. "How?" he asked. She shrugged lightly. "Helps if you're crazy. Come on. I do believe we're under a slight time constraint . . ." She started down the chasm. He stood behind, feeling drained. And oddly brightened. He should feel like a fool. He'd done it againhe'd been telling her how easy her life was, while she'd had that hiding inside of her all along. This time, though, he didn't feel like an idiot. He felt like he understood. Something. He didn't know what. The chasm just seemed a little brighter. Tien always did that to me . . . he thought. Even on the darkest day. He stood still long enough that frillblooms opened around him, their wide, fanlike fronds displaying veined patterns of orange, red, and violet. He eventually jogged after Shallan, shocking the plants closed. "I think," she said, "we need to focus on the positive side of being down here in this terrible chasm." She eyed him. He didn't say anything. "Come on," she said. "I . . . have the sense that it would be better not to encourage you." "What's the fun in that?" "Well, we are about to get hit by a highstorm's flood." "So our clothing will get washed," she said with a grin. "See! Positive." He snorted. "Ah, that bridgeman grunt dialect again," she noted. "That grunt meant," he said, "that at least if the waters come, it will wash away some of your stench." "Ha! Mildly amusing, but no points to you. I already established that you're the malodorous one. Reuse of jokes is strictly forbidden on pain of getting dunked in a highstorm." "All right then," he said. "It's a good thing we're down here because I had guard duty tonight. Now I'm going to miss it. That is practically like getting the day off." "To go swimming, no less!" He smiled. "I," she proclaimed, "am glad we are down here because the sun is far too bright up above, and it tends to give me a sunburn unless I wear a hat. It is much better to be down in the dank, dark, smelly, moldy, potentially lifethreatening depths. No sunburns. Just monsters." "I'm glad to be down here," he said, "because at least it was me, and not one of my men, who fell." She hopped over a puddle, then eyed him. "You're not very good at this." "Sorry. I meant that I'm glad to be down here because when we get out, everyone will cheer me for being a hero for rescuing you." "Better," Shallan said. "Except for the fact that I do believe that I am the one rescuing you." He glanced at her map. "Point." "I," she said, "am glad to be down here because I've always wondered what it's like to be a chunk of meat traveling through a digestive system, and these chasms remind me of the intestines." "I hope you're not serious." "What?" She looked shocked. "Of course I'm not. Ew." "You really do try too hard." "It's what keeps me insane." He scrambled up a large pile of debris, then offered a hand to help her. "I," he said, "am happy to be here because it reminds me of how lucky I am to be free of Sadeas's army." "Ah," she said, stepping up to the top with him. "His lighteyes sent us down here to gather," Kaladin said, sliding down the other side. "And didn't pay us much at all for the effort." "Tragic." "You could say," he told her as she stepped down off the pile, "that we were given only a pittance." He grinned at her. She cocked her head. "Pittance," he said, gesturing toward the depth of the hole they were in. "You know. We're in a pit . . ." "Oh, storms," she said. "You don't actually expect that to count. That was terrible!" "I know. I'm sorry. My mother would be disappointed." "She didn't like wordplay?" "No, she loved it. She'd just be mad I tried to do it when she wasn't around to laugh at me." Shallan smiled, and they continued on, keeping a brisk pace. "I am glad we're down here," she said, "because by now, Adolin will be worried sick about me so when we get back, he'll be ecstatic. He might even let me kiss him in public." Adolin. Right. That dampened his mood. "We probably need to stop so I can draw out our map," Shallan said, frowning at the sky. "And so that you can yell some more for our potential salvation." "I suppose," he said as she settled down to get out her map. He cupped his hands. "Hey, up there? Anyone? We're down here, and we're making bad puns. Please save us from ourselves!" Shallan chuckled. Kaladin smiled, then started as he actually heard something echoing back. Was that a voice? Or . . . Wait . . . A trumping soundlike a horn's call, but overlapping itself. It grew louder, washing over them. Then an enormous, skittering mass of carapace and claws crashed around the corner. Chasmfiend. Kaladin's mind panicked, but his body simply moved. He snatched Shallan by the arm, hauling her to her feet and pulling her into a run. She shouted, dropping her satchel. Kaladin pulled her after him and did not look back. He could feel the thing, too close, the walls of the chasm shaking from its pursuit. Bones, twigs, shell, and plants cracked and snapped. The monster trumped again, a deafening sound. It was almost upon them. Storms, but it could move. He'd never have imagined something so large being so quick. There was no distracting it this time. It was almost upon them; he could feel it right behind . . . There. He whipped Shallan in front of him and thrust her into a fissure in the wall. As a shadow loomed over him, he threw himself into the fissure, shoving Shallan backward. She grunted as he pressed her against some of the refuse of twigs and leaves that had been packed into this crack by floodwaters. The chasm fell silent. Kaladin could hear only Shallan's panting and his own heartbeat. They'd left most of their spheres on the ground, where Shallan had been preparing to draw. He still had his spear, his improvised lantern. Slowly, Kaladin twisted about, putting his back to Shallan. She held him from behind, and he could feel her tremble. Stormfather. He trembled himself. He twisted his spear to give light, peering out at the chasm. This fissure was shallow, and only a few feet stood between him and the opening. The frail, washedout light of his diamond spheres twinkled off the wet floor. It illuminated broken frillblooms on the walls and several writhing vines on the ground, severed from their plants. They twisted and flopped, like men arching their backs. The chasmfiend . . . Where was it? Shallan gasped, arms tightening around his waist. He looked up. There, higher up the crack, a large, inhuman eye watched them. He couldn't see the bulk of the chasmfiend's head; just part of the face and jaw, with that terrible glassy green eye. A large claw slammed against the side of the hole, trying to force its way in, but the crack was too small. The claw dug at the hole, and then the head withdrew. Scraping rock and chitin sounded in the chasm, but the thing didn't go far before stopping. Silence. A steady drip somewhere fell into a pool. But otherwise, silence. "It's waiting," Shallan whispered, head near his shoulder. "You sound proud of it!" Kaladin snapped. "A little." She paused. "How long, do you suppose, until . . ." He looked upward, but couldn't see the sky. The crack didn't run all the way up the side of the chasm, and was barely ten or fifteen feet tall. He leaned forward to look at the slot high above, not extending all the way out of the crack, just getting a little closer to the lip so he could see the sky. It was getting dark. Not sunset yet, but getting close. "Two hours, maybe," he said. "I" A crashing tempest of carapace charged down the chasm. Kaladin jumped back, pressing Shallan against the refuse again as the chasmfiend triedwithout successto get one of its legs into the fissure. The leg was still too large, and though the chasmfiend could shove the tip in toward themgetting close enough to brush Kaladinit wasn't enough to hurt them. That eye returned, reflecting the image of Kaladin and Shallantattered and dirtied from their time in the chasm. Kaladin looked less frightened than he felt, staring that thing in the eye, spear held up wardingly. Shallan, rather than looking terrified, seemed fascinated. Crazy woman. The chasmfiend withdrew again. It stopped just down the chasm. He could hear it settling down to watch. "So . . ." Shallan said, "we wait?" Sweat trickled down the sides of Kaladin's face. Wait. How long? He could imagine staying in here, like a frightened rockbud trapped in its shell, until the waters came crashing through the chasms. He'd survived a storm once. Barely, and only then with the aid of Stormlight. In here, it would be far different. The waters would whip them in a surge through the chasms, smashing them into walls, boulders, churning them with the dead until they drowned or were ripped limb from limb . . . It would be a very, very bad way to die. His grip tightened on his spear. He waited, sweating, worrying. The chasmfiend didn't leave. Minutes passed. Finally, Kaladin made his decision. He moved to step forward. "What are you doing!" Shallan hissed, sounding terrified. She tried to hold him back. "When I'm out," he said, "run the other way." "Don't be stupid!" "I'll distract it," he said. "Once you're free, I'll lead it away from you, then escape. We can meet back up." "Liar," she whispered. He twisted about, meeting her eyes. "You can get back to the warcamps on your own," he said. "I can't. You have information that needs to get to Dalinar. I don't. I have combat training. I might be able to get away from the thing after distracting it. You couldn't. If we wait here, we both die. Do you need more logic than that?" "I hate logic," she whispered. "Always have." "We don't have time to talk about it," Kaladin said, twisting around, his back to her. "You can't do this." "I can." He took a deep breath. "Who knows," he said more softly, "maybe I'll get in a lucky hit." He reached up and ripped the spheres off his spearhead, then tossed them out into the chasm. He'd need a steadier light. "Get ready." "Please," she whispered, sounding more frantic. "Don't leave me down in these chasms alone." He smiled wryly. "Is it really this hard for you to let me win one single argument?" "Yes!" she said. "No, I mean . . . Storms! Kaladin, it will kill you." He gripped his spear. The way things had been going with him lately, perhaps that was what he deserved. "Apologize to Adolin for me. I actually kind of like him. He's a good man. Not just for a lighteyes. Just . . . a good person. I've never given him the credit he deserves." "Kaladin . . ." "It has to happen, Shallan." "At least," she said, reaching her hand over his shoulder and past his head, "take this." "Take what?" "This," Shallan said. Then she summoned a Shardblade. I suspect that he is more a force than an individual now, despite your insistence to the contrary. That force is contained, and an equilibrium reached. Kaladin stared at the glistening length of metal, which dripped with condensation from its summoning. It glowed softly the color of garnet along several faint lines down its length. Shallan had a Shardblade. He twisted his head toward her, and in so doing, his cheek brushed the flat of the blade. No screams. He froze, then cautiously raised a finger and touched the cold metal. Nothing happened. The screech he had heard in his mind when fighting alongside Adolin did not recur. It seemed a very bad sign to him. Though he did not know the meaning of that terrible sound, it was related to his bond with Syl. "How?" he asked. "It's not important." "I rather think it is." "Not at the moment! Look, are you going to take this thing? Holding it this way is awkward. If I drop it by accident and cut off your foot, it's going to be your fault." He hesitated, regarding his face reflected in its metal. He saw corpses, friends with burning eyes. He'd refused these weapons each time one was offered to him. But always before, it had been after the fight, or at least on the practice grounds. This was different. Besides, he wasn't choosing to become a Shardbearer; he would only use this weapon to protect someone's life. Making a decision, he reached up and seized the Shardblade by the hilt. At least this told him one thingShallan wasn't likely to be a Surgebinder. Otherwise, he suspected she'd hate this Blade as much as he did. "You're not supposed to let people use your Blade," Kaladin said. "By tradition, only the king and the highprinces do that." "Great," she said. "You can report me to Brightness Navani for being wildly indecent and ignorant of protocol. For now, can we just survive, please?" "Yeah," he said, hefting the Blade. "That sounds wonderful." He barely knew how to use one of these. Training with a practice sword did not make you an expert with the real thing. Unfortunately, a spear was going to be of little use against a creature so large and so well armored. "Also . . ." Shallan said. "Could you not do that 'reporting me' thing I mentioned? That was a joke. I don't think I'm supposed to have that Blade." "Nobody would believe me anyway," Kaladin said. "You are going to run, right? As I instructed?" "Yes. But if you could, please lead the monster to the left." "That's toward the warcamps," Kaladin said, frowning. "I was planning to lead it deeper into the chasms, so that you" "I need to get back to my satchel," Shallan said. Crazy woman. "We're fighting for our lives, Shallan. The satchel is unimportant." "No, it's very important," she said. "I need it to . . . Well, the sketches in there show the pattern of the Shattered Plains. I'll need that to help Dalinar. Please, just do it." "Fine. If I can." "Good. And, um, please don't die, all right?" He was suddenly aware of her pressed against his back. Holding him, breath warm on his neck. She trembled, and he thought he could hear in her voice both terror and fascination at their situation. "I'll do my best," he said. "Get ready." She nodded, letting go of him. One. Two. Three. He leaped out into the chasm, then turned and dashed left, toward the chasmfiend. Storming woman. The beast lurked in the shadows in that direction. No, it was a shadow. An enormous, looming shadow, long and eellike, lifted above the floor of the chasm and gripping the walls with its legs. It trumped and surged forward, carapace scraping on rock. Holding tightly to the Shardblade, Kaladin threw himself to the ground and ducked underneath the monster. The ground heaved as the beast smashed claws toward him, but Kaladin came up unscathed. He swung wildly with the Shardblade, carving a line in the rock wall beside him but missing the chasmfiend. It curled in the chasm, twisting underneath itself, then turning about. The maneuver went far more smoothly for the monster than Kaladin would have hoped. How do I even kill something like this? Kaladin wondered, backing up as the chasmfiend settled on the floor of the chasm to inspect him. Hacking at that enormous body was unlikely to kill it quickly enough. Did it have a heart? Not the stone gemheart, but a real one? He'd have to try to get underneath it again. Kaladin continued to back down the chasm, trying to lead the creature away from Shallan. It moved more carefully than Kaladin would have expected. He was relieved to catch sight of Shallan escaping the crack and scrambling away down the passage. "Come on, you," Kaladin said, waving the Shardblade at the chasmfiend. It reared up in the chasm, but did not strike at him. It watched, eyes hidden in its darkened face. The only light came from the distant slit high above and the spheres he'd tossed out into the chasm, which now were behind the monster. Shallan's Blade glowed softly too, from a strange pattern along its length. Kaladin had never seen one do that before, but then, he'd never seen a Shardblade in the dark before. Looking up at the rearing, alien silhouette before himwith its too many legs, its twisted head, its segmented armorKaladin thought he must know what a Voidbringer looked like. Surely nothing more terrible than this could exist. Stepping backward, Kaladin stumbled on an outcropping of shalebark sprouting from the floor. The chasmfiend struck. Kaladin regained his balance easily, but had to throw himself into a roll which required dropping the Shardblade, lest he slice himself. Shadowy claws smashed around him as he came out of his roll and sprang one way, then the other. He ended up pressed against the slimy side of the chasm just in front of the monster, puffing. He was too close for the claws to get him, perhaps, and The head snapped down, mandibles gaping. Kaladin cursed, hurling himself to the side again. He grunted, rolling to his feet and scooping up the discarded Shardblade. It hadn't vanishedhe knew enough about them to understand that once Shallan instructed it to remain, it would stay until she summoned it back. Kaladin turned around as a claw came down where he had just been. He got a swipe at it, cutting through the claw's tip as it crashed into rock. His cut didn't seem to do much. The Blade scored the carapace and killed the flesh insideprompting a trump of angerbut the claw was enormous. He'd done the equivalent of cutting off the tip of an enemy soldier's big toe. Storms. He wasn't fighting the beast; he was just annoying it. It came more aggressively, sweeping at him with a claw. Fortunately, the confines of the chasm made it difficult for the creature to swing; its arms brushed the walls, and it couldn't pull back for full leverage. That was probably why Kaladin was still alive. He got out of the way of the sweep, barely, but tripped in the darkness again. He could hardly see. As another claw crashed toward him, Kaladin got to his feet and dashed away running farther down the corridor, farther from the light, passing plants and flotsam. The chasmfiend trumped and charged after him, clacking and scraping. Kaladin felt so slow without Stormlight. So clumsy and awkward. The chasmfiend was close. He judged his next move by instinct. Now! He stopped with a lurch, then sprinted back toward the creature. It slowed with great difficulty, carapace grinding on the walls, and Kaladin ducked and ran beneath it. He slammed the Shardblade upward, sinking it deep into the creature's underside. The beast trumped more frantically. He seemed to have actually hurt it, for it immediately lifted upward to pull itself off the sword. Then it twisted down upon itself in an eyeblink, and Kaladin found those frightful jaws coming at him. He threw himself forward, but the snapping jaws caught his leg. Blinding pain ran up the limb, and he struck out with the Blade even as the beast flung him about. He thought he hit its face, though he couldn't be certain. The world spun. He hit the ground and rolled. No time to be dizzy. With everything still spinning, he groaned and turned over. He'd lost the Shardbladehe didn't know where it was. His leg. He couldn't feel it. He looked down, expecting to see nothing but a ragged stump. It wasn't quite so bad. Bloodied, the trousers ripped, but he couldn't see bone. The numbness was from shock. His mind had gone analytical and focused on the wounds. That wasn't good. He needed the soldier at the moment, not the surgeon. The chasmfiend was righting itself in the chasm, and a chunk of its facial carapace was missing. Get. Away. Kaladin turned over and climbed to hands and knees, then lurched to his feet. The leg worked, kind of. His boot squished as he stepped. Where was the Shardblade? There, ahead. It had flown far, embedding itself in the ground near the spheres he'd tossed from the rift. Kaladin hobbled toward it, but had trouble walking, let alone running. He was halfway there when his leg gave out. He hit hard, scraping his arm on shalebark. The chasmfiend trumped and "Hey! Hey!" Kaladin twisted about. Shallan? What was that fool woman doing, standing in the chasm, waving her hands like a maniac? How had she even gotten past him? She yelled again, getting the chasmfiend's attention. Her voice echoed oddly. The chasmfiend turned from Kaladin to Shallan, then began to smash at her. "No!" Kaladin yelled. But what was the use in shouting? He needed his weapon. Gritting his teeth, he twisted about and scrambledas best he could to the Shardblade. Storms. Shallan . . . He ripped the sword from the rock, but then he collapsed again. The leg just wouldn't hold him. He twisted back, holding out the Blade, searching the chasm. The monster continued to swipe about, trumping, the terrible sound echoing and reverberating in the narrow confines. Kaladin couldn't see a corpse. Had Shallan escaped? Stabbing the blasted thing through the chest only seemed to have made it angrier. The head. His only chance was the head. Kaladin struggled to his feet. The monster stopped smashing against the ground and with a trump surged toward him. Kaladin gripped the sword in two hands, then wavered. His leg buckled beneath him. He tried to go down on one knee, but the leg gave out completely, and he slumped to the side and narrowly avoided slicing himself with the Shardblade. He splashed into a pool of water. In front of him, one of the spheres he'd tossed shone with a bright white light. He reached into the water, snatching it, clutching the chilled glass. He needed that Light. Storms, his life depended on it. Please. The chasmfiend loomed above. Kaladin sucked in a breath, straining, like a man gasping for air. He heard . . . as if distantly . . . Weeping. No power entered him. The chasmfiend swung and Kaladin twisted, and strangely found himself. The other version of him stood above him, sword raised, larger than life. It was bigger than him by half. What in the Almighty's own eyes . . . ? Kaladin thought, dumbfounded, as the chasmfiend smashed an arm down onto the figure beside Kaladin. That nothim shattered into a puff of Stormlight. What had he done? How had he done it? No matter. He lived. With a cry of desperation, he threw himself back to his feet and lurched toward the chasmfiend. He needed to get close, as he had before, too close for the claws to swing in these confines. So close that . . . The chasmfiend reared, then snapped down for a bite, mandibles extending, terrible eyes bearing down. Kaladin thrust upward. * * * The chasmfiend crashed down, chitin snapping, legs spasming. Shallan cried out, freehand to mouth, from where she hid behind a boulder, her skin and clothing turned deep black. The chasmfiend had fallen on Kaladin. Shallan dropped her paperit bore a drawing of her and another of Kaladin and scrambled across the rocks, dismissing the blackness around her. She'd needed to be close to the fighting for the illusions to work. Better if she'd been able to send them on Pattern, but that was problematic because She stopped in front of the stilltwitching beast, a heap of flesh and carapace like a fallen avalanche of stone. She shifted from one foot to another, uncertain what to do. "Kaladin?" she called out. Her voice was frail in the darkness. Stop it, she told herself. No timidity. You're past that. Taking a deep breath, she moved forward, picking her way over the huge armored legs. She tried to shove aside a claw, but it was far too heavy for her, so she climbed over it and skidded down the other side. She froze as she heard something. The chasmfiend's head lay nearby, massive eyes cloudy. Spren started to rise from it, like trails of smoke. The same ones as before, only . . . leaving? She held her light closer. The bottom half of Kaladin's body protruded from the chasmfiend's mouth. Almighty above! Shallan gasped, then scrambled forward. She tried, with difficulty, to pull Kaladin from the closed maw before summoning her Shardblade and cutting away at several mandibles. "Kaladin?" she asked, nervously peering into the thing's mouth from the side, where she'd removed a mandible. "Ow," a weak voice trailed back to her. Alive! "Hang on!" she said, hacking at the thing's head, careful not to cut too close to Kaladin. Violet ichor spurted out, coating her arms, smelling like wet mold. "This is kind of uncomfortable . . ." Kaladin said. "You're alive," Shallan said. "Stop complaining." He was alive. Oh, Stormfather. Alive. She would have a whole heap of prayers to burn when they got back. "Smells awful in here," Kaladin said weakly. "Almost as bad as you do." "Be glad," Shallan said as she worked. "Here, I have a reasonably perfect specimen of a chasmfiendwith only a minor case of being deadand I'm chopping it apart for you instead of studying it." "I'm eternally grateful." "How did you get in its mouth, anyway?" Shallan asked, prying off a piece of carapace with a sickening sound. She tossed it aside. "Stabbed it through the roof of its mouth," Kaladin said, "into the brain. Only way I could figure to kill the blasted thing." She leaned down, reaching her hand through the large hole she'd opened. With some workand with a little cutting at the front mandiblesshe managed to help Kaladin wiggle out the side of the mouth. Covered in ichor and blood, face pale from apparent blood loss, he looked like death itself. "Storms," she whispered, as he lay back on the rocks. "Bind my leg," Kaladin said weakly. "The rest of me should be fine. Heal right up . . ." She looked at the mess of his leg, and shivered. It looked like . . . Like . . . Balat . . . Kaladin wouldn't be walking on that leg anytime soon. Oh, Stormfather, she thought, cutting off the skirt of her dress at the knees. She wrapped his leg tightly, as he instructed. He seemed to think he didn't need a tourniquet. She listened to him; he'd probably bound far more wounds than she had. She cut the sleeve off her right arm and used that to bind a second wound on his side, where the chasmfiend had started to rip him in half as it bit. Then she settled down next to him, feeling drained and cold, legs and arm now exposed to the chill air of the chasm bottom. Kaladin took a deep breath, resting on the rock ground, eyes closed. "Two hours until the highstorm," he whispered. Shallan checked the sky. It was almost dark. "If that long," she whispered. "We beat it, but we're dead anyway, aren't we?" "Seems unfair," he said. Then he groaned, sitting up. "Shouldn't you" "Bah. I've had far worse wounds than this." She raised an eyebrow at him as he opened his eyes. He looked dizzy. "I have," he insisted. "That's not just soldier bravado." "This bad?" she asked. "How often?" "Twice," he admitted. He looked over the hulking form of the chasmfiend. "We actually killed the thing." "Sad, I know," she said, feeling depressed. "It was beautiful." "It would be more beautiful if it hadn't tried to eat me." "From my perspective," Shallan noted, "it didn't try, it succeeded." "Nonsense," Kaladin said. "It didn't manage to swallow me. Doesn't count." He held his hand out to her, as if for help getting to his feet. "You want to try to keep going?" "You expect me to just lie here in the chasm until the waters come?" "No, but . . ." She looked up. The chasmfiend was big. Maybe twenty feet tall, as it lay on its side. "What if we climbed up that thing, then tried to scale up to the top of the plateau?" The farther westward they'd gone, the shallower the chasms had grown. Kaladin looked up. "That's still a good eighty feet of climbing, Shallan. And what would we do on the top of the plateau? The storm would blow us off." "We could at least try to find some kind of shelter . . ." she said. "Storms, it really is hopeless, isn't it?" Oddly, he cocked his head. "Probably." "Only 'probably'?" "Shelter . . . You have a Shardblade." "And?" she asked. "I can't cut away a wall of water." "No, but you can cut stone." He looked up, toward the wall of the chasm. Shallan's breath caught in her throat. "We can carve out a cubby! Like the scouts use." "High up the wall," he said. "You can see the water line up there. If we can get above that . . ." It still meant climbing. She wouldn't have to go all the way to where the chasm got narrow at the top, but it wouldn't be an easy climb, by any means. And she had very little time. But it was a chance. "You're going to have to do it," Kaladin said. "I might be able to stand, with help. But climbing while wielding a Shardblade . . ." "Right," Shallan said, standing up. She took a deep breath. "Right." She started by scaling the back of the chasmfiend. The smooth carapace made for slippery climbing, but she found footholds between plates. Once on its back, she looked up toward the water line. It seemed much higher than it had from below. "Cut handholds," Kaladin called. Right. She kept forgetting about the Shardblade. She didn't want to think about it . . . No. No time for that now. She summoned the Blade and cut out a series of long strips of rock, sending chunks falling to bounce off the carapace. She tucked her hair behind her ear, working in the dim light to create a ladderlike series of handholds up the side of the wall. She started climbing them. Standing on one and clinging to the highest one, she summoned the Blade again and tried to cut a step even higher, but the thing was just so blasted long. Obligingly, it shrank in her hand to the size of a much shorter sword, really a big knife. Thank you, she thought, then cut out the next line of rock. Up she went, handhold after handhold. It was sweaty work, and she periodically had to climb back down and rest her hands from clinging. Eventually, she got about as high as she figured she could, just over the water line. She hung there awkwardly, then began hacking out sections of rock, trying to cut them so they wouldn't tumble backward onto her head. Falling stone made a beating sound on the dead chasmfiend's armor. "You're doing great!" Kaladin called up to her. "Keep at it!" "When did you get so peppy?" she shouted. "Ever since I assumed I was dead, then I suddenly wasn't." "Then remind me to try to kill you once in a while," she snapped. "If I succeed, it will make me feel better, and if I fail, it will make you feel better. Everyone wins!" She heard him chuckling as she dug deeper into the stone. It was more difficult than she'd have imagined. Yes, the Blade cut the rock easily, but she kept cutting sections that just wouldn't fall out. She had to chop them to pieces, then dismiss the Blade and grab chunks to pull them out. After over an hour of frantic work, however, she managed to craft a semblance of a refuge. She didn't get the cubby hollowed out as deeply as she wanted, but it would have to do. Drained, she crawled back down her improvised ladder one last time and flopped on the chasmfiend's back amid the rubble. Her arms felt like she'd been lifting something heavyand technically she probably had, since climbing meant lifting herself. "Done?" Kaladin called up from the chasm floor. "No," Shallan said, "but close enough. I think we might fit." Kaladin was silent. "You are coming up into the hole I just cut, Kaladin bridgeboy, chasmfiendslayer and gloombringer." She leaned over the side of the chasmfiend to look at him. "We are not having another stupid conversation about you dying in here while I bravely continue on. Understand?" "I'm not sure if I can walk, Shallan," Kaladin said with a sigh. "Let alone climb." "You're going," Shallan said, "if I have to carry you." He looked up, then grinned, face covered in dried violet ichor that he'd wiped away as best he could. "I'd like to see that." "Come on," Shallan said, rising with some difficulty herself. Storms, she was tired. She used the Blade to hack a vine off the wall. It took two hits to get it free, amusingly. The first severed its soul. Then, dead, it could actually be cut by the sword. The upper part withdrew, curling like a corkscrew to get height. She tossed down one side of the length she'd cut free. Kaladin took it with one hand, and favoring his bad legcarefully made his way up to the top of the chasmfiend. Once up, he flopped down beside her, sweat making trails through the grime on his face. He looked up at the ladder cut into the rock. "You're really going to make me climb that." "Yes," she said. "For perfectly selfish reasons." He looked to her. "I'm not going to have your last sight in life be a view of me standing in half a filthy dress, covered in purple blood, my hair an utter mess. It's undignified. On your feet, bridgeboy." In the distance, she heard a rumbling. Not good . . . "Climb up," he said. "I'm not" "Climb up," he said more firmly, "and lie down in the cubby, then reach your hand over the edge. Once I near the top, you can help me the last few feet." She fretted for a moment, then fetched her satchel and made the climb. Storms, those handholds were slick. Once up, she crawled into the shallow cubby and perched precariously, reaching down with one hand as she braced herself with the other. He looked up at her, then set his jaw and started climbing. He mostly pulled himself with his hands, wounded leg dangling, the other one steadying him. Heavily muscled, his soldier's arms slowly pulled him up slot by slot. Below, water trickled down the chasm. Then it started to gush. "Come on!" she said. Wind howled through the chasms, a haunting, eerie sound that called through the many rifts. Like the moaning of spirits long dead. The high sound was accompanied by a low, rumbling roar. All around, plants withdrew, vines twisting and pulling tight, rockbuds closing, frillblooms folding away. The chasm hid. Kaladin grunted, sweating, his face tense with pain and exertion, his fingers trembling. He pulled himself up another rung, then reached his hand up toward hers. The stormwall hit. ONE YEAR AGO Shallan slipped into Balat's room, holding a short note between her fingers. Balat spun, standing. He relaxed. "Shallan! You nearly killed me with fright." The small room, like many in the manor house, had open windows with simple reed shuttersthose were closed and latched today, as a highstorm was approaching. The last one before the Weeping. Servants outside pounded on the walls as they affixed sturdy stormshutters over the reed ones. Shallan wore one of her new dresses, the expensive kind that Father bought for her, after the Vorin style, straight and slimwaisted with a pocket on the sleeve. A woman's dress. She also wore the necklace he had given her. He liked it when she did that. Jushu lounged on a chair nearby, rubbing some kind of plant between his fingers, his face distant. He had lost weight during the two years since his creditors had dragged him from the house, though with those sunken eyes and the scars on his wrists, he still didn't look much like his twin. Shallan eyed the bundles Balat had been preparing. "Good thing Father never checks in on you, Balat. Those bundles look so fishy, we could make a stew out of them." Jushu chuckled, rubbing the scar on one wrist with the other hand. "Doesn't help that he jumps every time a servant so much as sneezes out in the hallway." "Quiet, both of you," Balat said, eyeing the window where workers locked a stormshutter in place. "This is not a time for levity. Damnation. If he discovers that I'm planning to leave . . ." "He won't," Shallan said, unfolding the letter. "He's too busy getting ready to parade himself in front of the highprince." "Does it feel odd to anyone else," Jushu said, "to be this rich? How many deposits of valuable stone are there on our lands?" Balat turned back to packing his bundles. "So long as it keeps Father happy, I don't care." The problem was, it hadn't made Father happy. Yes, House Davar was now wealthythe new quarries provided a fantastic income. Yet, the better off they were, the darker Father grew. Walking the hallways grumbling. Lashing out at servants. Shallan scanned the letter's contents. "That's not a pleased face," Balat said. "They still haven't been able to find him?" Shallan shook her head. Helaran had vanished. Really vanished. No more contact, no more letters; even the people he'd been in touch with earlier had no idea where he'd gone. Balat sat down on one of his bundles. "So what do we do?" "You will need to decide," Shallan said. "I have to get out. I have to." He ran his hand through his hair. "Eylita is ready to go with me. Her parents are away for the month, visiting Alethkar. It's the perfect time." "If you can't find Helaran, then what?" "I'll go to the highprince. His bastard said that he'd listen to anyone willing to speak against Father." "That was years ago," Jushu said, leaning back. "Father's in favor now. Besides, the highprince is nearly dead; everyone knows it." "It's our only chance," Balat said. He stood up. "I'm going to leave. Tonight, after the storm." "But Father" Shallan began. "Father wants me to ride out and check on some of the villages along the eastern valley. I'll tell him I'm doing that, but instead I'll pick up Eylita and we'll ride for Vedenar and go straight to the highprince. By the time Father arrives a week later, I'll have had my say. It might be enough." "And Malise?" Shallan asked. The plan was still for him to take their stepmother to safety. "I don't know," Balat said. "He's not going to let her go. Maybe once he leaves to visit the highprince, you can send her away someplace safe? I don't know. Either way, I have to go. Tonight." Shallan stepped forward, laying a hand on his arm. "I'm tired of the fear," Balat said to her. "I'm tired of being a coward. If Helaran has vanished, then I really am eldest. Time to show it. I won't just run, spending my life wondering if Father's minions are hunting us. This way . . . this way it will be over. Decided." The door slammed open. For all her complaints that Balat was acting suspicious, Shallan jumped just as high as he did, letting out a squeak of surprise. It was only Wikim. "Storms, Wikim!" Balat said. "You could at least knock or" "Eylita is here," Wikim said. "What?" Balat leaped forward, grabbing his brother. "She wasn't to come! I was going to pick her up." "Father summoned her," Wikim said. "She arrived with her handmaid just now. He's speaking with her in the feast hall." "Oh no," Balat said, shoving Wikim aside, barreling through the door. Shallan followed, but stopped in the doorway. "Don't do anything foolish!" she called after him. "Balat, the plan!" He didn't appear to have heard her. "This could be bad," Wikim said. "Or it could be wonderful," Jushu said from behind them, still lounging. "If Father pushes Balat too far, maybe he'll stop whining and do something." Shallan felt cold as she stepped into the hallway. That coldness . . . was that panic? Overwhelming panic, so sharp and strong it washed away everything else. This had been coming. She'd known this had been coming. They tried to hide, they tried to flee. Of course that wouldn't work. It hadn't worked with Mother either. Wikim passed her, running. She stepped slowly. Not because she was calm, but because she felt pulled forward. A slow pace resisted the inevitability. She turned up the steps instead of going down to the feast hall. She needed to fetch something. It took only a minute. She soon returned, the pouch given to her long ago tucked into the safepouch in her sleeve. She walked down the steps and to the doorway of the feast hall. Jushu and Wikim waited just outside of it, watching tensely. They made way for her. Inside the feast hall, there was shouting, of course. "You shouldn't have done this without talking to me!" Balat said. He stood before the high table, Eylita at his side, holding to his arm. Father stood on the other side of the table, halfeaten meal before him. "Talking to you is useless, Balat. You don't hear." "I love her!" "You're a child," Father said. "A foolish child without regard for your house." Bad, bad, bad, Shallan thought. Father's voice was soft. He was most dangerous when his voice was soft. "You think," Father continued, leaning forward, palms on the tabletop, "I don't know about your plan to leave?" Balat stumbled back. "How?" Shallan stepped into the room. What is that on the floor? she thought, walking along the wall toward the door into the kitchens. Something blocked the door from closing. Rain began to pelt the rooftop outside. The storm had come. The guards were in their guardhouse, the servants in their quarters to wait the storm's passing. The family was alone. With the windows closed, the only light in the room was the cool illumination of spheres. Father did not have a fire burning in the hearth. "Helaran is dead," Father said. "Did you know that? You can't find him because he's been killed. I didn't even have to do it. He found his own death on a battlefield in Alethkar. Idiot." The words threatened Shallan's cold calm. "How did you find out I was leaving?" Balat demanded. He stepped forward, but Eylita held him back. "Who told you?" Shallan knelt by the obstruction in the kitchen doorway. Thunder rumbled, making the building vibrate. The obstruction was a body. Malise. Dead from several blows to the head. Fresh blood. Warm corpse. He had killed her recently. Storms. He'd found out about the plan, had sent for Eylita and waited for her to arrive, then killed his wife. Not a crime of the moment. He'd murdered her as punishment. So it has come to this, Shallan thought, feeling a strange, detached calm. The lie becomes the truth. This was Shallan's fault. She stood up and rounded the room toward where servants had left a pitcher of wine, with cups, for Father. "Malise," Balat said. He hadn't looked toward Shallan; he was just guessing. "She broke down and told you, didn't she? Damnation. We shouldn't have trusted her." "Yes," Father said. "She talked. Eventually." Balat's sword made a whispering rasp as he pulled it from its leather sheath. Father's sword followed. "Finally," Father said. "You show hints of a backbone." "Balat, no," Eylita said, clinging to him. "I won't fear him any longer, Eylita! I won't!" Shallan poured wine. They clashed, Father leaping over the high table, swinging in a twohanded blow. Eylita screamed and scrambled back while Balat swung at his father. Shallan did not know much of swordplay. She had watched Balat and the others spar, but the only real fights she'd seen were duels at the fair. This was different. This was brutal. Father bashing his sword down again and again toward Balat, who blocked as best he could with his own sword. The clang of metal on metal, and above it all the storm. Each blow seemed to shake the room. Or was that the thunder? Balat stumbled before the onslaught, falling on one knee. Father batted the sword out of Balat's fingers. Could it really be over that quickly? Only seconds had passed. Not like the duels at all. Father loomed over his son. "I've always despised you," Father said. "The coward. Helaran was noble. He resisted me, but he had passion. You . . . you crawl about, whining and complaining." Shallan moved up to him. "Father?" She handed the wine toward him. "He's down. You've won." "I always wanted sons," Father said. "And I got four. All worthless! A coward, a drunkard, and a weakling." He blinked. "Only Helaran . . . Only Helaran . . ." "Father?" Shallan said. "Here." He took the wine, gulping it down. Balat grabbed his sword. Still on one knee, he struck with a lunge. Shallan screamed, and the sword made a strange clang as it barely missed Father, stabbing through his coat and out the back, connecting with something metallic. Father dropped the cup. It smashed, empty, to the ground. He grunted, feeling at his side. Balat pulled the sword back and stared upward at his father in horror. Father's hand came back with a touch of blood on it, but not much. "That's the best you have?" Father demanded. "Fifteen years of sword training, and that's your best attack? Strike at me! Hit me!" He held his sword out to the side, raising his other hand. Balat started to blubber, sword slipping from his fingers. "Bah!" Father said. "Useless." He tossed his sword onto the high table, then stepped over to the hearth. He grabbed an iron poker, then walked back. "Useless." He slammed the poker down on Balat's thigh. "Father!" Shallan screamed, trying to take his arm. He shoved her aside as he struck again, smashing his poker against Balat's leg. Balat screamed. Shallan hit the ground hard, knocking her head against the floor. She could only hear what happened next. Shouts. The poker connecting with a sound like a dull thump. The storm raging above. "Why." Smack. "Can't." Smack. "You." Smack. "Do." Smack. "Anything." Smack. "Right?" Shallan's vision cleared. Father drew deep breaths. Blood had splattered his face. Balat whimpered on the floor. Eylita held to him, face buried in his hair. Balat's leg was a bloody mess. Wikim and Jushu still stood in the doorway to the hall, looking horrified. Father looked to Eylita, murder in his eyes. He raised his poker to strike. But then the weapon slipped from his fingers and clanged to the ground. He looked at his hand as if surprised, then stumbled. He grabbed the table for support, but fell to his knees, then slumped to the side. Rain pelted the roof. It sounded like a thousand scurrying creatures looking for a way into the building. Shallan forced herself to her feet. Coldness. Yes, she recognized that coldness inside of her now. She'd felt it before, on the day when she'd lost her mother. "Bind Balat's wounds," she said, approaching the weeping Eylita. "Use his shirt." The woman nodded through her tears and began working with trembling fingers. Shallan knelt beside her father. He lay motionless, eyes open and dead, staring at the ceiling. "What . . . what happened?" Wikim asked. She hadn't noticed him and Jushu timidly entering the room, rounding the table and joining her. Wikim peered over her shoulder. "Did Balat's strike to the side . . ." Father was bleeding there; Shallan could feel it through the clothing. It wasn't nearly bad enough to have caused this though. She shook her head. "You gave me something a few years ago," she said. "A pouch. I kept it. You said it grows more potent over time." "Oh, Stormfather," Wikim said, raising his hand to his mouth. "The blackbane? You . . ." "In his wine," Shallan said. "Malise is dead by the kitchen. He went too far." "You've killed him," Wikim said, staring at their father's corpse. "You've killed him!" "Yes," Shallan said, feeling exhausted. She stumbled over to Balat, then began helping Eylita with the bandages. Balat was conscious and grunting at the pain. Shallan nodded to Eylita, who fetched him some wine. Unpoisoned, of course. Father was dead. She'd killed him. "What is this?" Jushu asked. "Don't do that!" Wikim said. "Storms! You're going through his pockets already?" Shallan glanced over to see Jushu pulling something silvery from Father's coat pocket. It was shrouded in a small black bag, mildly wet with blood, only pieces of it showing from where Balat's sword had struck. "Oh, Stormfather," Jushu said, pulling it out. The device consisted of several chains of silvery metal connecting three large gemstones, one of which was cracked, its glow lost. "Is this what I think it is?" "A Soulcaster," Shallan said. "Prop me up," Balat said as Eylita returned with the wine. "Please." Reluctantly the girl helped him sit. His leg . . . his leg was not in good shape. They would need to get him a surgeon. Shallan stood, wiping bloodied hands on her dress, and took the Soulcaster from Jushu. The delicate metal was broken where the sword had struck it. "I don't understand," Jushu said. "Isn't that blasphemy? Don't those belong to the king, only to be used by ardents?" Shallan rubbed her thumb across the metal. She couldn't think. Numbness . . . shock. That was it. Shock. I killed Father. Wikim yelped suddenly, jumping back. "His leg twitched." Shallan spun on the body. Father's fingers spasmed. "Voidbringers!" Jushu said. He looked up at the ceiling, and at the raging storm. "They're here. They're inside of him. It" Shallan knelt next to the body. The eyes trembled, then focused on her. "It wasn't enough," she whispered. "The poison wasn't strong enough." "Oh, storms!" Wikim said, kneeling next to her. "He's still breathing. It didn't kill him, it just paralyzed him." His eyes widened. "And he's waking." "We need to finish the job, then," Shallan said. She looked to her brothers. Jushu and Wikim stumbled away, shaking their heads. Balat, dazed, was barely conscious. She turned back to her father. He was looking at her, his eyes moving easily now. His leg twitched. "I'm sorry," she whispered, unhooking her necklace. "Thank you for what you did for me." She wrapped the necklace around his neck. Then she began to twist. She used the handle of one of the forks that had fallen from the table as her father tried to steady himself. She looped one side of the closed necklace around it, and in twisting, pulled the chain very tight around Father's throat. "Now go to sleep," she whispered, "in chasms deep, with darkness all around you . . ." A lullaby. Shallan spoke the song through her tearsthe song he'd sung for her as a child, when she was frightened. Red blood speckled his face and covered her hands. "Though rock and dread may be your bed, so sleep my baby dear." She felt his eyes on her. Her skin squirmed as she held the necklace tight. "Now comes the storm," she whispered, "but you'll be warm, the wind will rock your basket . . ." Shallan had to watch as his eyes bulged out, his face turning colors. His body trembling, straining, trying to move. The eyes looked to her, demanding, betrayed. Almost, Shallan could imagine that the storm's howls were part of a nightmare. That soon she would awaken in terror, and Father would sing to her. As he'd done when she was a child . . . "The crystals fine . . . will glow sublime . . ." Father stopped moving. "And with a song . . . you'll sleep . . . my baby dear." You, however, have never been a force for equilibrium. You tow chaos behind you like a corpse dragged by one leg through the snow. Please, hearken to my plea. Leave that place and join me in my oath of nonintervention. Kaladin caught Shallan's hand. Boulders crashed above, smashing against the plateaus, breaking off chunks and tossing them down around him. Wind raged. Water swelled below, rising toward him. He clung to Shallan, but their wet hands started to slip. And then, in a sudden surge, her grip tightened. With a strength that seemed to belie her smaller form, she heaved. Kaladin shoved with his good leg as water washed over it, and forced himself up the remaining distance to join her in the rocky alcove. The hollow was barely three or four feet deep, shallower than the crack they'd hid in. Fortunately, it faced westward. Though icy wind twisted about and sprayed water on them, the brunt of the storm was broken by the plateau. Puffing, Kaladin pulled against the wall of the alcove, his injured leg smarting like nothing else, Shallan clinging to him. She was a warmth in his arms, and he held to her as much as she did him, both of them sitting hunched against the rock, his head brushing the top of the hollowed hole. The plateau shuddered, quivering like a frightened man. He couldn't see much; the blackness was absolute except when lightning came. And the sound. Thunder crashing, seemingly disconnected from the sprays of lightning. Water roared like an angry beast, and the flashes illuminated a frothing, churning, raging river in the chasm. Damnation . . . it was almost up to their alcove. It had risen fifty or more feet in moments. The dirty water was filled with branches, broken plants, vines ripped from their mountings. "The sphere?" Kaladin asked in the blackness. "You had a sphere with you for light." "Gone," she shouted over the roar. "I must have dropped it when I grabbed you!" "I didn't" A crash of thunder, accompanied by a blinding flash of light, sent him stuttering. Shallan pulled more tightly against him, fingers digging into his arm. The light left an afterimage in his eyes. Storms. He could swear that afterimage was a face, horribly twisted, the mouth pulled open. The next lightning bolt lit the flood just outside with a sequence of crackling light, and it showed water bobbing with corpses. Dozens of them pulled past in the current, dead eyes toward the sky, many just empty sockets. Men and Parshendi. The water surged upward, and a few inches of it flooded the chamber. The water of dead men. The storm went dark again, as black as a cavern beneath the ground. Just Kaladin, Shallan, and the bodies. "That was," Shallan said, her head near his, "the most surreal thing I've ever seen." "Storms are strange." "You speak from experience?" "Sadeas hung me out in one," he said. "I was supposed to die." That tempest had tried to rip the skin, then muscles, from his skeleton. Rain like knives. Lightning like a cauterizing iron. And a small figure, all white, standing before him with hands forward, as if to part the tempest for him. Tiny and frail, yet as strong as the winds themselves. Syl . . . what have I done to you? "I need to hear the story," Shallan said. "I'll tell it to you sometime." Water washed up over them again. For a moment, they became lighter, floating in the sudden burst of water. The current pulled with unexpected strength, as if eager to tow them out into the river. Shallan screamed and Kaladin gripped the rock on either side, holding on in a panic. The river retreated, though he could still hear it rushing. They settled back into the alcove. Light came from above, too steady to be lightning. Something was glowing on the plateau. Something that moved. It was hard to see, since water streamed off the side of the plateau above, falling in a sheet before their refuge. He swore he saw an enormous figure walking up there, a glowing inhuman form, followed by another, alien and sleek. Striding the storm. Leg after leg, until the glow passed. "Please," Shallan said. "I need to hear something other than that. Tell me." He shivered, but nodded. Voices. Voices would help. "It started when Amaram betrayed me," he said, tone hushed, just loud enough for herpressed closeto hear. "He made me a slave for knowing the truth, that he'd killed my men in his lust to get a Shardblade. That it mattered more to him than his own soldiers, more to him than honor . . ." He continued on, talking of his days as a slave, of his attempts to escape. Of the men he'd gotten killed for trusting him. It gushed from him, a story he'd never told. Who would he have told it to? Bridge Four had lived most of it with him. He told her of the wagon and of Tvlakvthat name earned a gasp. She apparently knew him. He spoke of the numbness, the . . . nothing. The thinking he should kill himself, but the trouble believing that it was worth the effort. And then, Bridge Four. He didn't talk about Syl. Too much pain there right now. Instead, he talked of bridge runs, of terror, of death, and of decision. Rain washed over them, blown in swirls, and he swore he could hear chanting out there somewhere. Some kind of strange spren zipped past their enclosure, red and violet and reminiscent of lightning. Was that what Syl had seen? Shallan listened. He would have expected questions from her, but she didn't ask a single one. No pestering for details, no chattering. She apparently did know how to be quiet. He got through it all, amazingly. The last bridge run. Rescuing Dalinar. He wanted to spill it all out. He talked about facing the Parshendi Shardbearer, about how he'd offended Adolin, about holding the bridgehead on his own . . . When he finished, they both let the silence settle on them, and shared warmth. Together, they stared out at the rushing water just out of reach and lit by flashing. "I killed my father," Shallan whispered. Kaladin looked toward her. In a flash of light, he saw her eyes as she looked up from where her head had been resting against his chest, beads of water on her eyelashes. With his hands around her waist, hers around him, it was as close as he'd held a woman since Tarah. "My father was a violent, angry man," Shallan said. "A murderer. I loved him. And I strangled him as he lay on the floor, watching me, unable to move. I killed my own father . . ." He didn't prod her, though he wanted to know. Needed to know. She went on, fortunately, speaking of her youth and the terrors she had known. Kaladin had thought his life terrible, but there was one thing he'd had, and perhaps not cherished enough: parents who loved him. Roshone had brought Damnation itself to Hearthstone, but at least Kaladin's mother and father had always been there to rely upon. What would he have done, if his father had been like the abusive, hateful man Shallan described? If his mother had died before his own eyes? What would he have done if, instead of living off Tien's light, he had been required to bring light to the family? He listened with wonder. Storms. Why wasn't this woman broken, truly broken? She described herself that way, but she was no more broken than a spear with a chipped bladeand a spear like that could still be as sharp a weapon as any. He preferred one with a score or two on the blade, a worn handle. A spearhead that had known fighting was just . . . better than a new one. You could know it had been used by a man fighting for his life, and that it had remained sure and not broken. Marks like those were signs of strength. He did feel a chill as she mentioned her brother Helaran's death, anger in her voice. Helaran had been killed in Alethkar. At Amaram's hands. Storms . . . I killed him, didn't I? Kaladin thought. The brother she loved. Had he told her about that? No. No, he hadn't mentioned that he'd killed the Shardbearer, only that Amaram had killed Kaladin's men to cover up his lust for the weapon. He'd gotten used to, over the years, referencing the event without mentioning that he'd killed a Shardbearer. His first few months as a slave had beaten into him the dangers of talking about an event like that. He hadn't even realized he'd fallen into that habit of speaking here. Did she realize? Had she inferred that Kaladin, not Amaram, had been the one to actually kill the Shardbearer? She didn't seem to have made that connection. She continued talking, speaking of the nightalso during a stormwhen she'd poisoned, then murdered her father. Almighty above. This woman was stronger than he'd ever been. "And so," she continued, pressing her head back against his chest, "we decided that I would find Jasnah. She . . . had a Soulcaster, you see." "You wanted to see if she could fix yours?" "That would have been too rational." He couldn't see her scowl at herself, but he heard it, somehow. "My planbeing stupid and naivewas to swap mine for hers and bring back a working one to make money for the family." "You had never left your family's lands before." "Yes." "And you went to rob one of the smartest women in the world?" "Er . . . yes. Remember that bit about 'stupid and naive'? Anyway, Jasnah found out. Fortunately, I intrigued her and she agreed to take me on as a ward. The marriage to Adolin was her idea, a way to protect my family while I trained." "Huh," he said. Lightning flashed outside. The winds seemed to be building even further, if that was possible, and he had to raise his voice even though Shallan was right there. "Generous, for a woman you intended to rob." "I think she saw something in me that" Silence. Kaladin blinked. Shallan was gone. He panicked for a moment, searching about himself, until he realized that his leg no longer hurt and the fuzziness in his headfrom blood loss, shock, and possible hypothermiawas gone too. Ah, he thought. This again. He took a deep breath and stood up, stepping out of the blackness to the lip of the opening. The stream below had stopped, as if frozen solid, and the opening of the alcovewhich Shallan had made far too low to stand up incould now hold him standing at full height. He looked out and met the gaze of a face as wide as eternity itself. "Stormfather," Kaladin said. Some named him Jezerezeh, Herald. This didn't fit what Kaladin had heard of any Herald, however. Was the Stormfather a spren, perhaps? A god? It seemed to stretch forever, yet he could see it, make out the face in its infinite expanse. The winds had stopped. Kaladin could hear his own heartbeat. CHILD OF HONOR. It spoke to him this time. Last time, in the middle of the storm, it had notthough it had done so in dreams. Kaladin looked to the side, again checking to see if Shallan was there, but he couldn't see her any longer. She wasn't part of this vision, whatever it was. "She's one of them, isn't she?" he asked. "Of the Knights Radiant, or at least a Surgebinder. That's what happened when fighting the chasmfiend, that's how she survived the fall. It wasn't me either time. It was her." The Stormfather rumbled. "Syl," Kaladin said, looking back to the face. The plateaus in front of him had vanished. It was just him and the face. He had to ask. It hurt him, but he had to. "What have I done to her?" YOU HAVE KILLED HER. The voice shook everything. It was as if . . . as if the shaking of the plateau and his own body made the sounds for the voice. "No," Kaladin whispered. "No!" IT HAPPENED AS IT ONCE DID, the Stormfather said, angry. A human emotion. Kaladin recognized it. MEN CANNOT BE TRUSTED, CHILD OF TANAVAST. YOU HAVE TAKEN HER FROM ME. MY BELOVED ONE. The face seemed to withdraw, fading. "Please!" Kaladin screamed. "How can I fix it? What can I do?" IT CANNOT BE FIXED. SHE IS BROKEN. YOU ARE LIKE THE ONES WHO CAME BEFORE, THE ONES WHO KILLED SO MANY OF THOSE I LOVE. FAREWELL, SON OF HONOR. YOU WILL NOT RIDE MY WINDS AGAIN. "No, I" The storm returned. Kaladin collapsed back into the alcove, gasping at the sudden restoration of pain and cold. "Kelek's breath!" Shallan said. "What was that?" "You saw the face?" Kaladin asked. "Yes. So vast . . . I could see stars in it, stars upon stars, infinity . . ." "The Stormfather," Kaladin said, tired. He reached around beneath him for something that was suddenly glowing. A sphere, the one Shallan had dropped earlier. It had gone dun, but was now renewed. "That was amazing," she whispered. "I need to draw it." "Good luck," Kaladin said, "in this rain." As if to punctuate his point, another wave of it washed over them. It would swirl in between the chasms, twisting about and sometimes blowing back at them. They sat in water a few inches deep, but it didn't threaten to pull them away again. "My poor drawings," Shallan said, pulling her satchel to her breast with her safehand as she held to himthe only thing to hold towith her other. "The satchel is waterproof, but . . . I don't know that it's highstormproof." Kaladin grunted, staring out at the rushing water. There was a mesmerizing pattern to it, surging with broken plants and leaves. No corpses, not anymore. The flowing water rose in a large bump before them, as if rushing over something large beneath. The chasmfiend's carcass, he realized, was still wedged down there. It was too heavy for even the flood to budge. They fell silent. With light, the need to speak had passed, and though he considered confronting her about what he was increasingly sure she was, he said nothing. Once they were free, there would be time. For now, he wanted to thinkthough he was still glad for her presence. And aware of it in more ways than one, pushed against him and wearing the wet, increasingly tattered dress. His conversation with the Stormfather, however, drew his attention away from that sort of thought. Syl. Had he really . . . killed her? He had heard her weeping earlier, hadn't he? He tried, just out of futile experimentation, to pull in some Stormlight. He kind of wanted Shallan to see, to gauge her reaction. It didn't work, of course. The storm slowly passed, the floodwaters receding bit by bit. After the rains slackened to the level of an ordinary storm, the waters started flowing in the other direction. It was as he'd always assumed, though never seen. Now rain was falling more on the ground west of the Plains than on the Plains themselves, and the drainage was all to the east. The river churnedfar more lethargicallyback out the way it had come. The chasmfiend's corpse emerged from the river. Then, finally, the flood was donethe river reduced to a trickle, the rain a drizzle. The drops that dripped from the plateaus above were far larger and heavier than the rain itself. He shifted to move to climb down, but realized that Shallan, curled up against him, had fallen asleep. She snored softly. "You must be the only person," he whispered, "to ever fall asleep while outside in a highstorm." Uncomfortable though he was, he realized he really didn't fancy the idea of climbing down with this wounded leg. Strength sapped, feeling a crushing darkness at what the Stormfather had said about Syl, he let himself succumb to the numbness, and fell asleep. The cosmere itself may depend upon our restraint. "At least speak with him, Dalinar," Amaram said. The man walked quickly to match Dalinar's pace, his cloak of the Knights Radiant billowing behind him, as they inspected the lines of troops loading up wagons with supplies for the trip out onto the Shattered Plains. "Come to an accommodation with Sadeas before you leave. Please." Dalinar, Navani, and Amaram passed a group of spearmen running to get into place with their battalion, which was counting ranks. Just beyond them, the men and women of the camp acted similarly excited. Cremlings scuttled this way and that, moving through pools of water left by the storm. Last night's highstorm was the final one of the season. Sometime tomorrow, the Weeping would begin. Wet though it would be, it provided a window. Safety from storms, time to strike out. He planned to leave by midday. "Dalinar?" Amaram asked. "Will you talk to him?" Careful, Dalinar thought. Don't make any judgments just yet. This had to be done with precision. At his side, Navani eyed him. He'd shared his plans regarding Amaram with her. "I" Dalinar began. A series of horns interrupted him, blaring above through the camp. They seemed more urgent than usual. A chrysalis had been spotted. Dalinar counted the rhythms, placing the plateau location. "Too far," he said, pointing to one of his scribes, a tall, lanky woman that often helped Navani with her experiments. "Who is on the schedule for today's runs?" "Highprinces Sebarial and Roion, sir," the scribe said, consulting her ledger. Dalinar grimaced. Sebarial never sent troops, even when commanded. Roion was slow. "Send the signal flags to tell those two the gemheart is too far out to try for. We'll be marching for the Parshendi camp later today, and I can't have some of our troops splitting off and running for a gemheart." He made the order as if either man would commit any troops to his march. He had hopes for Roion. Almighty send that the man didn't get frightened at the last minute and refuse to go on the expedition. The attendant rushed away to call off the plateau run. Navani pointed to a group of scribes who were tabulating supply lists, and he nodded, stopping while she walked over to talk to the women and get an estimate on readiness. "Sadeas won't like a gemheart being left unharvested," Amaram said as the two of them waited. "When he hears you called off the run, he'll send his own troops for it." "Sadeas will do as he wishes, regardless of my intervention." "Each time you allow him to disobey openly," Amaram said, "it drives a wedge between him and the Throne." Amaram took Dalinar by the arm. "We have bigger problems than you and Sadeas, my friend. Yes, he betrayed you. Yes, he likely will again. But we can't afford to let the two of you go to war. The Voidbringers are coming." "How can you be certain of that, Amaram?" Dalinar asked. "Instinct. You gave me this title, this position, Dalinar. I can feel something from the Stormfather himself. I know that a disaster is coming. Alethkar needs to be strong. That means you and Sadeas working together." Dalinar shook his head slowly. "No. The opportunity for Sadeas to work with me has long since passed. The road to unity in Alethkar is not at the table of negotiation, it's out there." Across the plateaus, to the Parshendi camp, wherever it was. An end to this war. Closure for both him and his brother. Unite them. "Sadeas wants you to try this expedition," Amaram said. "He's certain you will fail." "And when I do not," Dalinar said, "he will lose all credibility." "You don't even know where you'll find the Parshendi!" Amaram said, throwing his hands into the air. "What are you going to do, just wander out there until you run across them?" "Yes." "Madness. Dalinar, you appointed me to this positionan impossible position, mind youwith the charge to be a light to all nations. I'm finding it hard to even get you to listen to me. Why should anyone else?" Dalinar shook his head, looking eastward, over those broken plains. "I have to go, Amaram. The answers are out there, not here. It's like we walked all the way to the shore, then huddled there for years, peering out at the waters but afraid to get wet." "But" "Enough." "Eventually, you're going to have to give away authority and let it stay given, Dalinar," Amaram said softly. "You can't hold it all, pretending you aren't in charge, but then ignore orders and advice as if you were." The words, problematically truthful, slapped him hard. He did not react, not outwardly. "What of the matter I assigned you?" Dalinar asked him. "Bordin?" Amaram said. "So far as I can tell, his story checks out. I really think that the madman is only raving about having had a Shardblade. It's patently ridiculous that he might have actually had one. I" "Brightlord!" A breathless young woman in a messenger uniformnarrow skirt slit up the sides, with silk leggings beneathscrambled up to him. "The plateau!" "Yes," Dalinar said, sighing. "Sadeas is sending out troops?" "No, sir," the woman said, flush in the cheeks from her run. "Not . . . I mean . . . He came out of the chasms." Dalinar frowned, looking sharply toward her. "Who?" "Stormblessed." * * * Dalinar ran the entire way. When he drew close to the triage pavilion at the edge of campnormally reserved for tending to the wounded who came back from plateau runshe had trouble seeing because of the crowd of men in cobalt blue uniforms blocking the path. A surgeon was yelling for them to back up and give him room. Some of the men saw Dalinar and saluted, hastily pulling out of the way. The blue parted like waters blown in a storm. And there he was. Ragged, hair matted in snarls, face scratched and leg wrapped in an improvised bandage. He sat on a triage table and had removed his uniform coat, which sat on the table beside him, tied into a round bundle with what looked like a vine wrapping it. Kaladin looked up as Dalinar approached, and then moved to pull himself to his feet. "Soldier, don't" Dalinar began, but Kaladin didn't listen. He hauled himself up tall, using a spear to support his bad leg. Then he raised hand to breast, a slow motion, as if the arm were tied with weights. It was, Dalinar figured, the most tired salute he'd ever seen. "Sir," Kaladin said. Exhaustionspren puffed around Kaladin like little jets of dust. "How . . ." Dalinar said. "You fell into a chasm!" "I fell facefirst, sir," Kaladin said, "and fortunately, I'm particularly hardheaded." "But . . ." Kaladin sighed, leaning on his spear. "I'm sorry, sir. I don't really know how I survived. Some spren were involved, we think. Anyway, I hiked back through the chasms. I had a duty to see to." He nodded to the side. Farther into the triage tent, Dalinar saw something he hadn't originally noticed. Shallan Davara tangle of red hair and ripped clothingsat amid a pack of surgeons. "One future daughterinlaw," Kaladin said, "delivered safe and sound. Sorry about the damage done to the packaging." "But there was a highstorm!" Dalinar said. "We really wanted to get back before that," Kaladin said. "Ran into some troubles along the way, I'm afraid." With lethargic movements, he took out his side knife and cut the vines off the package beside him. "You know how everyone kept saying there was a chasmfiend prowling about in the nearby chasms?" "Yes . . ." Kaladin lifted the remnants of his coat away from the table, revealing a massive green gemstone. Though bulbous and uncut, the gemheart shone with a powerful inner light. "Yeah," Kaladin said, taking the gemheart in one hand and tossing it to the ground before Dalinar. "We took care of that for you, sir." In the blink of an eye, gloryspren replaced his exhaustionspren. Dalinar stared mutely at the gemheart as it rolled and tapped against the front of his boot, its light almost blinding. "Oh, don't be so melodramatic, bridgeman," Shallan called. "Brightlord Dalinar, we found the beast already dead and rotting in the chasm. We survived the highstorm by climbing up its back to a crack in the side of the plateau, where we waited out the rains. We could only get the gemheart out because the thing was halfrotted already." Kaladin looked to her, frowning. He turned back to Dalinar almost immediately. "Yes," Kaladin said. "That's what happened." He was a far worse liar than Shallan was. Amaram and Navani finally arrived, the former having remained behind to escort the latter. Navani gasped when she saw Shallan, then ran to her, snapping angrily at the surgeons. She fussed and bustled around Shallan, who seemed far less the worse for wear than Kaladin, despite the terrible state of her dress and hair. In moments, Navani had Shallan wrapped in a blanket to cover her exposed skin, then she sent a runner back to prepare a warm bath and meal at Dalinar's complex, to be had in whichever order Shallan wished. Dalinar found himself smiling. Navani pointedly ignored Shallan's protests that none of this was necessary. The mother axehound had finally emerged. Shallan was apparently no longer an outsider, but one of Navani's clutchand Chana help the man or woman who stood between Navani and one of her own. "Sir," Kaladin said, finally letting the surgeons settle him back on the table. "The soldiers are gathering supplies. The battalions forming up. Your expedition?" "You needn't worry, soldier," Dalinar said. "I could hardly expect you to guard me in your state." "Sir," Kaladin said, more softly, "Brightness Shallan found something out there. Something you need to know. Talk to her before you set out." "I'll do so," Dalinar said. He waited for a moment, then waved the surgeons aside. Kaladin seemed to be in no immediate danger. Dalinar stepped closer, leaning in. "Your men waited for you, Stormblessed. They skipped meals, pulled triple shifts. I half think they'd have sat out here, at the head of the chasms, through the highstorm itself if I hadn't intervened." "They are good men," Kaladin said. "It's more than that. They knew you would return. What is it they understand about you that I don't?" Kaladin met his eyes. "I've been searching for you, haven't I?" Dalinar said. "All this time, without seeing it." Kaladin looked away. "No, sir. Maybe once, but . . . I'm just what you see, and not what you think. I'm sorry." Dalinar grunted, inspecting Kaladin's face. He had almost thought . . . But perhaps not. "Give him anything he wants or needs," Dalinar said to the surgeons, letting them approach. "This man is a hero. Again." He withdrew, letting the bridgemen crowd aroundwhich, of course, started the surgeons cursing at them again. Where had Amaram gone? The man had been here just a few minutes ago. As the palanquin arrived for Shallan, Dalinar decided to follow and find out just what it was that Kaladin said the girl knew. * * * One hour later, Shallan snuggled into a nest of warm blankets, wet hair on her neck, smelling of flowered perfume. She wore one of Navani's dresseswhich was too big for her. She felt like a child in her mother's clothing. That was, perhaps, exactly what she was. Navani's sudden affection was unexpected, but Shallan would certainly accept it. The bath had been glorious. Shallan wanted to curl up on this couch and sleep for ten days. For the moment, however, she let herself revel in the distinctive feeling of being clean, warm, and safe for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. "You can't take her, Dalinar." Navani's voice came from Pattern on the table beside Shallan's couch. She didn't feel a moment's guilt for sending him to spy on the two of them while she bathed. After all, they had been talking about her. "This map . . ." Dalinar's voice said. "She can draw you a better map and you can take it." "She can't draw what she hasn't seen, Navani. She'll need to be there, with us, to draw out the center of the pattern on the Plains once we penetrate in that direction." "Someone else" "Nobody else has been able to do this," Dalinar said, sounding awed. "Four years, and none of our scouts or cartographers saw the pattern. If we're going to find the Parshendi, I'm going to need her. I'm sorry." Shallan winced. She was not doing a very good job of keeping her drawing ability hidden. "She just got back from that terrible place," Navani's voice said. "I won't let a similar accident occur. She will be safe." "Unless you all die," Navani snapped. "Unless this entire expedition is a disaster. Then everything will be taken from me. Again." Pattern stopped, then spoke further in his own voice. "He held her at this point, and whispered some things I did not hear. From there, they got very close and made some interesting noises. I can reproduce" "No," Shallan said, blushing. "Too private." "Very well." "I need to go with them," Shallan said. "I need to complete that map of the Shattered Plains and find some way to correlate it with the ancient ones of Stormseat." It was the only way to find the Oathgate. Assuming it wasn't destroyed in whatever shattered the Plains, Shallan thought. And, if I do find it, will I even be able to open it? Only one of the Knights Radiant was said to be able to open the pathway. "Pattern," she said softly, clutching a mug of warmed wine, "I'm not a Radiant, right?" "I do not think so," he said. "Not yet. There is more to do, I believe, though I cannot be certain." "How can you not know?" "I was not me when the Knights Radiant existed. It is complex to explain. I have always existed. We are not 'born' as men are, and we cannot truly die as men do. Patterns are eternal, as is fire, as is the wind. As are all spren. Yet, I was not in this state. I was not . . . aware." "You were a mindless spren?" Shallan said. "Like the ones that gather around me when I draw?" "Less than that," Pattern said. "I was . . . everything. In everything. I cannot explain it. Language is insufficient. I would need numbers." "Surely there are others among you, though," Shallan said. "Older Cryptics? Who were alive back then?" "No," Pattern said softly. "None who experienced the bond." "Not a single one?" "All dead," Pattern said. "To us, this means they are mindlessas a force cannot truly be destroyed. These old ones are patterns in nature now, like Cryptics unborn. We have tried to restore them. It does not work. Mmmm. Perhaps if their knights still lived, something could be done . . ." Stormfather. Shallan pulled the blanket around her closer. "An entire people, all killed?" "Not just one people," Pattern said, solemn. "Many. Spren with minds were less plentiful then, and the majorities of several spren peoples were all bonded. There were very few survivors. The one you call Stormfather lived. Some others. The rest, thousands of us, were killed when the event happened. You call it the Recreance." "No wonder you're certain I will kill you." "It is inevitable," Pattern said. "You will eventually betray your oaths, breaking my mind, leaving me deadbut the opportunity is worth the cost. My kind is too static. We always change, yes, but we change in the same way. Over and over. It is difficult to explain. You, though, you are vibrant. Coming to this place, this world of yours, I had to give up many things. The transition was . . . traumatic. My memory returns slowly, but I am pleased at the chance. Yes. Mmm." "Only a Radiant can open the pathway," Shallan said, then took a sip of her wine. She liked the warmth it built inside of her. "But we don't know why, or how. Maybe I'll count as enough of a Radiant to make it work." "Perhaps," Pattern said. "Or you could progress. Become more. There is something more you must do." "Words?" Shallan said. "You have said the Words," Pattern said. "You said them long ago. No . . . it is not words that you lack. It is truth." "You prefer lies." "Mmm. Yes, and you are a lie. A powerful one. However, what you do is not just lie. It is truth and lie mixed. You must understand both." Shallan sat in thought, finishing her wine, until the door to the sitting room burst open, letting in Adolin. He stopped, wildeyed, regarding her. Shallan stood up, smiling. "It appears that I have failed at properly" She cut off as he grabbed her in an embrace. Drat. She'd had a perfectly clever quip prepared too. She'd worked on it during the entire bath. Still, it was nice to be held. This was the most physically forward he'd ever been. Surviving an impossible journey did have its benefits. She let herself wrap her arms around him, feel the muscles on his back through his uniform, breathe in his cologne. He held her for several heartbeats. Not enough. She twisted her head and forced a kiss, her mouth enclosing his, firm in his embrace. Adolin melted into the kiss, and did not pull back. Eventually, though, the perfect moment ended. Adolin took her head in his hands, looking into her eyes, and smiled. Then he grabbed her in another hug and laughed that barking, exuberant laugh of his. A real laugh, the one of which she was so fond. "Where were you?" she asked. "Visiting the other highprinces," Adolin said, "one at a time and delivering Father's final ultimatumto join us in this assault, or forever be known as those who refused to see the Vengeance Pact fulfilled. Father thought giving me something to do would help distract me from . . . well, you." He leaned back, holding her by the arms, and gave her a silly grin. "I have pictures to draw for you," Shallan said, grinning back. "I saw a chasmfiend." "A dead one, right?" "Poor thing." "Poor thing?" Adolin said, laughing. "Shallan, if you'd seen a live one, you'd have surely been killed!" "Almost surely." "I still can't believe . . . I mean, you fell. I should have saved you. Shallan, I'm sorry. I ran for Father first" "You did what you should have," she said. "No person on that bridge would have had you rescue one of us instead of your father." He embraced her once more. "Well, I won't let it happen again. Nothing like it. I'll protect you, Shallan." She stiffened. "I will make sure you aren't ever hurt," Adolin said fiercely. "I should have realized that you could be caught in an assassination attempt intended for Father. We'll have to make it so that you aren't ever in that kind of position again." She pulled away from him. "Shallan?" Adolin said. "Don't worry, they won't get to you. I'll protect you. I " "Don't say things like that," she hissed. "What?" He ran his hand through his hair. "Just don't," Shallan said, shivering. "The man who did this, who threw that lever, is dead now," Adolin said. "Is that what you're worried about? He was poisoned before we could get answers though we're sure he belonged to Sadeasbut you don't need to worry about him." "I will worry about what I wish to worry about," Shallan said. "I don't need to be protected." "But" "I don't!" Shallan said. She breathed in and out, calming herself. She reached out and took him by the hand. "I won't be locked away again, Adolin." "Again?" "It's not important." Shallan raised his hand and wove his fingers between her own. "I appreciate the concern. That's all that matters." But I won't let you, or anyone else, treat me like a thing to be hidden away. Never, never again. Dalinar opened the door into his study, letting Navani pass through first, then followed her into the room. Navani looked serene, her face a mask. "Child," Dalinar said to Shallan, "I have a somewhat difficult request to make of you." "Anything you wish, Brightlord," Shallan said, bowing. "But I do wish to make a request of you in turn." "What is it?" "I need to accompany you on your expedition." Dalinar smiled, shooting a glance at Navani. The older woman did not react. She can be so good with her emotions, Shallan thought. I can't even read what she's thinking. That would be a useful skill to learn. "I believe," Shallan said, looking back to Dalinar, "that the ruins of an ancient city are hidden on the Shattered Plains. Jasnah was searching for them. So, then, must I." "This expedition will be dangerous," Navani said. "You understand the risks, child?" "Yes." "One would think," Navani continued, "that considering your recent ordeal, you would wish for a time of shelter." "Uh, I wouldn't say things like that to her, Aunt," Adolin said, scratching at his head. "She's kind of funny about them." "It is not a matter of humor," Shallan said, lifting her head high. "I have a duty." "Then I shall allow it," Dalinar said. He liked anything having to do with duty. "And your request of me?" Shallan asked him. "This map," Dalinar said, crossing the room and holding up the crinkled map detailing her path back through the chasms. "Navani's scholars say this is as accurate as any map we have. You can truly expand this? Deliver a map of the entire Shattered Plains?" "Yes." Particularly if she used what she remembered of Amaram's map to fill in some details. "But Brightlord, might I make a suggestion?" "Speak." "Leave your parshmen behind in the warcamp," she said. He frowned. "I cannot accurately explain why," Shallan said, "but Jasnah felt that they were dangerous. Particularly to bring out onto the Plains. If you wish my help, if you trust me to create this map for you, then trust me on this one single point. Leave the parshmen. Conduct this expedition without them." Dalinar looked to Navani, who shrugged. "Once our things are packed, they won't be needed really. The only ones inconvenienced will be the officers, who will have to set up their own tents." Dalinar considered, chewing on her request. "This comes from Jasnah's notes?" Dalinar asked. Shallan nodded. To the side, blessedly, Adolin piped in. "She's told me some of it, Father. You should listen to her." Shallan shot him a grateful smile. "Then it shall be done," Dalinar said. "Gather your things and send word to your uncle Sebarial, Brightness. We're leaving within the hour. Without parshmen." THE END OF Part Four "Congratulations," Brother Lhan said. "You have found your way to the easiest job in the world." The young ardent pursed her lips, looking him up and down. She had obviously not expected her new mentor to be rotund, slightly drunk, and yawning. "You are the . . . senior ardent I've been assigned to?" "'To whom I've been assigned,'" Brother Lhan corrected, putting an arm around the young woman's shoulders. "You're going to have to learn how to speak punctiliously. Queen Aesudan likes to feel that those around her are refined. It makes her feel refined by association. My job is to mentor you on these items." "I have been an ardent here in Kholinar for over a year," the woman said. "I hardly think that I need mentoring at all" "Yes, yes," Brother Lhan said, guiding her out of the monastery's entryway. "It's just that, you see, your superiors say you might need a little extra direction. Being assigned to the queen's own retinue is a marvelous privilege! One, I understand, you have requested with some measure of . . . ah . . . persistence." She walked with him, and each step revealed her reluctance. Or perhaps confusion. They passed into the Circle of Memories, a round room with ten lamps on the walls, one for each of the ancient Epoch Kingdoms. An eleventh lamp represented the Tranquiline Halls, and a large ceremonial keyhole set into the wall represented the need for ardents to ignore borders, and look only at the hearts of men . . . or something like that. He wasn't sure, honestly. Outside the Circle of Memories, they entered one of the covered walkways between monastery buildings, a light rain sprinkling the rooftops. The last leg of the walkways, the sunwalk, gave a wonderful view of Kholinarat least on a clear day. Even today, Lhan could see much of the city, as both the temple and the high palace occupied a flattopped hill. Some said that the Almighty himself had drawn Kholinar in rock, scooping out sections of ground with a fluent finger. Lhan wondered how drunk he'd been at the time. Oh, the city was beautiful, but it was the beauty of an artist who wasn't quite right in the mind. The rock took the shape of rolling hills and steeply sloping valleys, and when the stone was cut into, it exposed thousands of brilliant strata of red, white, yellow, and orange. The most majestic formations were the windbladesenormous, curving spines of rock that cut through the city. Beautifully lined with colorful strata on the sides, they curved, curled, rose, and fell unpredictably, like fish leaping from the ocean. Supposedly, this all had to do with how the winds blew through the area. He did mean to get around to studying why that was. One of these days. Slippered feet fell softly on glossy marble, accompanying the sound of the rains, as Lhan escorted the girlwhat was her name again? "Look at that city," he said. "Everyone out there has to work, even the lighteyes. Bread to bake, lands to oversee, cobblestones to . . . ah . . . cobble? No, that's shoes. Damnation. What do you call people who cobble, but don't actually cobble?" "I don't know," the young woman said softly. "Well, it's no matter to us. You see, we have only one job, and it's an easy one. To serve the queen." "That is not easy work." "But it is!" Lhan said. "So long as we're all serving the same way. In a very . . . ah . . . careful way." "We are sycophants," the young woman said, staring out over the city. "The queen's ardents tell her only what she wants to hear." "Ah, and here we are, at the point of the matter." Lhan patted her on the arm. What was her name again? They'd told it to him. . . . Pai. Not a very Alethi name; she'd probably chosen it upon being made an ardent. It happened. A new life, a new name, often a simple one. "You see, Pai," he said, watching to notice if she reacted. Yes, it did seem he'd gotten the name right. His memory must be improving. "This is what your superiors wanted me to talk to you about. They fear that if you're not properly instructed, you might cause a bit of a storm here in Kholinar. Nobody wants that." He and Pai passed other ardents along the sunwalk, and Lhan nodded to them. The queen had a lot of ardents. A lot of ardents. "Here's the thing," Lhan said. "The queen . . . she sometimes worries that maybe the Almighty isn't pleased with her." "Rightly so," Pai said. "She" "Hush, now," Lhan said, wincing. "Just . . . hush. Listen. The queen figures that if she treats her ardents well, it will buy her favor with the One who makes the storms, so to speak. Nice food. Nice robes. Fantastic quarters. Lots of free time to do whatever we want. We get these things as long as she thinks she's on the right path." "Our duty is to give her the truth." "We do!" Lhan said. "She's the Almighty's chosen, isn't she? Wife of King Elhokar, ruler while he's off fighting a holy war of retribution against the regicides on the Shattered Plains. Her life is very hard." "She throws feasts every night," Pai whispered. "She engages in debauchery and excess. She wastes money while Alethkar languishes. People in outer towns starve as they send food here, with the understanding that it will be passed on to soldiers who need it. It rots because the queen can't be bothered." "They have plenty of food on the Shattered Plains," Lhan said. "They've got gemstones coming out of their ears there. And nobody is starving here either. You're exaggerating. Life is good." "It is if you're the queen or one of her lackeys. She even canceled the Beggars' Feasts. It is reprehensible." Lhan groaned inside. This one . . . this one was going to be hard. How to persuade her? He wouldn't want the child to do anything that endangered her. Or, well, him. Mostly him. They entered the palace's grand eastern hall. The carved pillars here were considered one of the greatest artworks of all time, and one could trace their history back to before the shadowdays. The gilding on the floor was ingenious a lustrous gold that had been placed beneath Soulcast ribbons of crystal. It ran like rivulets between floor mosaics. The ceiling had been decorated by Oolelen himself, the great ardent painter, and depicted a storm blowing in from the east. All of this could have been crem in the gutter for the reverence Pai gave it. She seemed to see only the ardents strolling about, contemplating the beauty. And eating. And composing new poems for Her Majestythough honestly, Lhan avoided that sort of thing. It seemed like work. Perhaps Pai's attitude came from a residual jealousy. Some ardents were envious of the queen's personal chosen. He tried to explain some of the luxuries that were now hers: warm baths, horseback riding using the queen's personal stables, music and art . . . Pai's expression grew darker with each item. Bother. This wasn't working. New plan. "Here," Lhan said, steering her toward the steps. "There's something I want to show you." The steps twisted down through the palace complex. He loved this place, every bit of it. White stone walls, golden sphere lamps, and an age. Kholinar had never been sacked. It was one of the few eastern cities that hadn't suffered that fate in the chaos after the Hierocracy's fall. The palace had burned once, but that fire had died out after consuming the eastern wing. Rener's miracle, it was called. The arrival of a highstorm to put out the fire. Lhan swore the place still smelled of smoke, three hundred years later. And . . . Oh, right. The girl. They continued down the steps and eventually entered the palace kitchens. Lunch had ended, though that didn't stop Lhan from snatching a plate of fried bread, Herdazian style, from the counter as they passed. Plenty was laid out for the queen's favorites, who might find themselves peckish at any time. Being a proper sycophant could work up an appetite. "Trying to lure me with exotic foods?" Pai asked. "For the past five years, I have eaten only a bowl of boiled tallew for each meal, with a piece of fruit on special occasions. This will not tempt me." Lhan stopped in place. "You're not serious, are you?" She nodded. "What is wrong with you?" She blushed. "I am of the Devotary of Denial. I wished to experience separation from the physical needs of my" "This is worse than I thought," Lhan said, taking her by the hand and pulling her through the kitchens. Near the back, they found the door leading out to the service yard, where supplies were delivered and refuse taken away. There, shaded from the rain by an awning, they found piles of uneaten food. Pai gasped. "Such waste! You bring me here to convince me not to make a storm? You are doing quite the opposite!" "There used to be an ardent who took all of this and distributed it to the poor," Lhan said. "She died a few years back. Since then, the others have made some effort to take care of it. Not much, but some. The food does get taken away eventually, usually dumped into the square to be picked through by beggars. It's mostly rotten by then." Storms. He could almost feel the heat of her anger. "Now," Lhan said, "if there were an ardent among us whose only hunger was to do good, think how much she could accomplish. Why, she could feed hundreds just from what is wasted." Pai eyed the piles of rotting fruit, the sacks of open grain, now ruined in the rain. "Now," Lhan said, "let us contemplate the opposite. If some ardent tried to take away that which we have . . . well, what might happen to her?" "Is that a threat?" she asked softly. "I do not fear physical harm." "Storms," Lhan said. "You think we'd Girl, I have someone else put my slippers on for me in the morning. Don't be dense. We're not going to hurt you. Too much work." He shivered. "You'd get sent away, quickly and quietly." "I do not fear that either." "I doubt you fear anything," Lhan said, "except maybe having a little fun. But what good would it do anyone if you were sent away? Our lives wouldn't change, the queen would remain the same, and that food out there would still spoil. But if you stay, you can do good. Who knows, maybe your example will help all of us reform, eh?" He patted her on the shoulder. "Think about it for a few minutes. I want to go finish my bread." He wandered off, checking over his shoulder a few times. Pai settled down beside the heaps of rotting food and stared at them. She didn't seem bothered by the ripe odor. Lhan watched her from inside until he got bored. When he got back from his afternoon massage, she was still there. He ate dinner in the kitchen, which wasn't terribly luxurious. The girl was entirely too interested in those heaps of garbage. Finally, as evening fell, he ambled back to her. "Don't you even wonder?" she asked, staring at those piles of refuse, rain pattering just beyond. "Don't you stop to think about the cost of your gluttony?" "Cost?" he asked. "I told you nobody starves because we" "I don't mean the monetary cost," she whispered. "I mean the spiritual cost. To you, to those around you. Everything's wrong." "Oh, it's not that bad," he said, settling down. "It is. Lhan, it's bigger than the queen, and her wasteful feasts. It wasn't much better before that, with King Gavilar's hunts and the wars, princedom against princedom. The people hear of the glory of the battle on the Shattered Plains, of the riches there, but none of it ever materializes here. "Does anyone among the Alethi elite care about the Almighty anymore? Sure, they curse by his name. Sure, they talk about the Heralds, burn glyphwards. But what do they do? Do they change their lives? Do they listen to the Arguments? Do they transform, recasting their souls into something greater, something better?" "They have Callings," Lhan said, fidgeting with his fingers. Digiting, then? "The devotaries help." She shook her head. "Why don't we hear from Him, Lhan? The Heralds said we defeated the Voidbringers, that Aharietiam was the great victory for mankind. But shouldn't He have sent them to speak with us, to counsel us? Why didn't they come during the Hierocracy and denounce us? If what the Church had been doing was so evil, where was the word of the Almighty against it?" "I . . . Surely you're not suggesting we return to that?" He pulled out his handkerchief and dabbed at his neck and head. This conversation was getting worse and worse. "I don't know what I'm suggesting," she whispered. "Only that something is wrong. All of this is just so very wrong." She looked to him, then climbed to her feet. "I have accepted your proposal." "You have?" "I will not leave Kholinar," she said. "I will stay here and do what good I can." "You won't get the other ardents into trouble?" "My problem is not with the ardents," she said, offering a hand to help him to his feet. "I will simply try to be a good example for all to follow." "Well, then. That seems like a fine choice." She walked off, and he dabbed his head. She hadn't promised, not exactly. He wasn't certain how worried he should be about that. Turned out, he should have been very worried. The next morning, he stumbled into the People's Halla large, open building in the shadow of the palace where the king or queen addressed the concerns of the masses. A murmuring crowd of horrified ardents stood just inside the perimeter. Lhan had already heard, but he had to see for himself. He forced his way to the front. Pai knelt on the floor here, head bowed. She'd painted all night, apparently, writing glyphs on the floor by spherelight. Nobody had noticed. The place was usually locked up tight when not in use, and she'd started working well after everyone was either asleep or drunk. Ten large glyphs, written directly on the stone of the floor running up to the dais with the king's Common Throne. The glyphs listed the ten foolish attributes, as represented by the ten fools. Beside each glyph was a written paragraph in women's script explaining how the queen exemplified each of the fools. Lhan read with horror. This . . . this didn't just chastise. It was a condemnation of the entire government, of the lighteyes, and of the Throne itself! Pai was executed the very next morning. The riots started that evening. That voice deep within Eshonai still screamed. Even when she didn't attune the old Rhythm of Peace. She kept herself busy to quiet it, walking the perfectly circular plateau just outside of Narak, the one where her soldiers often practiced. Her people had become something old, yet something new. Something powerful. They stood in lines on this plateau, humming to Fury. She divided them by combat experience. A new form would not a soldier make; many of these had been workers all their lives. They would have a part to play. They would bring about something grand. "The Alethi will come," Venli said, strolling at Eshonai's side and absently bringing energy to her fingers and letting it play between two of them. Venli smiled often while wearing this new form. Otherwise, it didn't seem to have changed her at all. Eshonai knew that she herself had changed. But Venli . . . Venli acted the same. Something felt wrong about that. "The agent who sent this report is certain of it," Venli continued. "Your visit to the Blackthorn seems to have encouraged them to action, and the humans intend to strike toward Narak in force. Of course, this could still turn into a disaster." "No," Eshonai said. "No. It is perfect." Venli looked to her, stopping on the rock field. "We need no more training. We should act, right now, to bring a highstorm." "We will do it when the humans near," Eshonai said. "Why? Let us do it tonight." "Foolishness," Eshonai said. "This is a tool to use in battle. If we produce an unexpected storm now, the Alethi won't come, and we won't win this war. We must wait." Venli seemed thoughtful. Finally, she smiled, then nodded. "What do you know that you aren't telling me?" Eshonai demanded, taking her sister by the shoulder. Venli smiled more broadly. "I'm simply persuaded. We must wait. The storm will blow the wrong way, after all. Or is it all other storms that have blown the wrong way, and this one will be the first to blow the right way?" The wrong way? "How do you know? About the direction?" "The songs." The songs. But . . . they said nothing about . . . Something deep within Eshonai nudged her to move on. "If that is true," she said, "we'll have to wait until the humans are practically on top of us to catch them in it." "Then that is what we do," Venli said. "I will set to the teaching. Our weapon will be ready." She spoke to the Rhythm of Craving, a rhythm like the old Rhythm of Anticipation, but more violent. Venli walked away, joined by her oncemate and many of her scholars. They seemed comfortable in these forms. Too comfortable. They couldn't have held these forms before . . . could they? Eshonai shoved down the screams and went to prepare another battalion of new soldiers. She had always hated being a general. How ironic, then, that she would be recorded in their songs as the warleader who had finally crushed the Alethi. Taravangian, king of Kharbranth, awoke to stiff muscles and an ache in his back. He didn't feel stupid. That was a good sign. He sat up with a groan. Those aches were perpetual now, and his best healers could only shake their heads and promise him that he was fit for his age. Fit. His joints cracked like logs on the fire and he couldn't stand quickly, lest he lose his balance and topple to the floor. To age truly was to suffer the ultimate treason, that of one's body against oneself. He sat up in his cot. Water lapped quietly against the hull of his cabin, and the air smelled of salt. He heard shouts in the near distance, however. The ship had arrived on schedule. Excellent. As he settled himself, one servant approached with a table and another with a warm, wet cloth for wiping his eyes and hands. Behind them waited the King's Testers. How long had it been since Taravangian had been alone, truly alone? Not since before the aches had come upon him. Maben knocked on the open door, bearing his morning meal on a tray, stewed and spiced grain mush. It was supposed to be good for his constitution. Tasted like dishwater. Bland dishwater. Maben stepped forward to set out the meal, but Mralla Thaylen man in a black leather cuirass who wore both his head and eyebrows shavedstopped her with a hand to the arm. "Tests first," Mrall said. Taravangian looked up, meeting the large man's gaze. Mrall could loom over a mountain and intimidate the wind itself. Everyone assumed he was Taravangian's head bodyguard. The truth was more disturbing. Mrall was the one who got to decide whether Taravangian would spend the day as king or as a prisoner. "Surely you can let him eat first!" Maben said. "This is an important day," Mrall said, voice low. "I would know the result of the testing." "But" "It is his right to demand this, Maben," Taravangian said. "Let us be on with it." Mrall stepped back, and the testers approached, a group of three stormwardens in deliberately esoteric robes and caps. They presented a series of pages covered in figures and glyphs. They were today's variation on a sequence of increasingly challenging mathematical problems devised by Taravangian himself on one of his better days. He picked up his pen with hesitant fingers. He did not feel stupid, but he rarely did. Only on the worst of days did he immediately recognize the difference. On those days, his mind was thick as tar, and he felt like a prisoner in his own mind, aware that something was profoundly wrong. Today wasn't one of those, fortunately. He wasn't a complete idiot. At worst, he'd just be very stupid. He set to his task, solving what mathematical problems he could. It took the better part of an hour, but during the process, he was able to gauge his capacity. As he had suspected, he was not terribly smartbut he was not stupid, either. Today . . . he was average. That would do. He turned over the problems to the stormwardens, who consulted in low voices. They turned to Mrall. "He is fit to serve," one proclaimed. "He may not offer binding commentary on the Diagram, but he may interact outside of supervision. He may change government policy so long as there is a threeday delay before the changes take effect, and he may also freely pass judgment in trials." Mrall nodded, looking to Taravangian. "Do you accept this assessment and these restrictions, Your Majesty?" "I do." Mrall nodded, then stepped back, allowing Maben to set out Taravangian's morning meal. The trio of stormwardens tucked away the papers he'd filled out, then they retreated to their own cabins. The testing was an extravagant procedure, and consumed valuable time each morning. Still, it was the best way he had found to deal with his condition. Life could be tricky for a man who awoke each morning with a different level of intelligence. Particularly when the entire world might depend upon his genius, or might come crashing down upon his idiocy. "How is it out there?" Taravangian asked softly, picking at his meal, which had gone cold during the testing. "Horrible," Mrall said with a grin. "Just as we wanted it." "Do not take pleasure in suffering," Taravangian replied. "Even when it is a work of our hands." He took a bite of the mush. "Particularly when it is a work of our hands." "As you wish. I will do so no more." "Can you really change that easily?" Taravangian asked. "Turn off your emotions on a whim?" "Of course," Mrall said. Something about that tickled at Taravangian, some thread of interest. If he had been in one of his more brilliant states, he might have seized upon itbut today, he sensed thought seeping away like water between fingers. Once, he had fretted about these missed opportunities, but he had eventually made his peace. Days of brilliancehe had come to learnbrought their own problems. "Let me see the Diagram," he said. Anything to distract from this slop they insisted on feeding him. Mrall stepped aside, allowing Adrotagiahead of Taravangian's scholarsto approach, bearing a thick, leatherbound volume. She set it onto the table before Taravangian, then bowed. Taravangian rested his fingers upon the leatherbound cover, feeling a moment of . . . reverence? Was that right? Did he revere anything anymore? God was dead, after all, and Vorinism therefore a sham. This book, though, was holy. He opened it to one of the pages marked with a reed. Inside were scribbles. Frenetic, bombastic, majestic scribbles that had been painstakingly copied from the walls of his former bedroom. Sketches laid atop one another, lists of numbers that seemed to make no sense, lines upon lines upon lines of script written in a cramped hand. Madness. And genius. Here and there, Taravangian could find hints that this writing was his own. The way he wiggled a line, the way he wrote along the edge of a wall, much like how he would write along the side of a page when he was running out of room. He didn't remember any of this. It was the product of twenty hours of lucid insanity, the most brilliant he had ever been. "Does it strike you as odd, Adro," Taravangian asked the scholar, "that genius and idiocy are so similar?" "Similar?" Adrotagia asked. "Vargo, I do not see them as similar at all." He and Adrotagia had grown up together, and she still used Taravangian's boyhood nickname. He liked that. It reminded him of days before all of this. "On both my most stupid days and my most incredible," Taravangian said, "I am unable to interact with those around me in a meaningful way. It is like . . . like I become a gear that cannot fit those turning beside it. Too small or too large, it does not matter. The clock will not work." "I had not considered that," Adrotagia said. When Taravangian was at his stupidest, he was not allowed from his room. Those were the days he spent drooling in a corner. When he was merely dullminded, he was allowed out under supervision. He spent those nights crying for what he had done, knowing that the atrocities he committed were important, but not understanding why. When he was dull, he could not change policy. Interestingly, he had decided that when he was too brilliant, he was also not allowed to change policy. He'd made this decision after a day of genius where he'd thought to fix all of Kharbranth's problems with a series of very rational edictssuch as requiring people to take an intelligence test of his own devising before being allowed to breed. So brilliant on one hand. So stupid on another. Is that your joke here, Nightwatcher? he wondered. Is that the lesson I'm to learn? Do you even care about lessons, or is what you do to us merely for your own amusement? He turned his attention back to the book, the Diagram. That grand plan he had devised on his singular day of unparalleled brilliance. Then, too, he'd spent the day staring at a wall. He'd written on it. Babbling the whole time, making connections no man had ever before made, he had scribbled all over his walls, floor, even parts of the ceiling he could reach. Most of it had been written in an alien scripta language he himself had devised, for the scripts he had known had been unable to convey ideas precisely enough. Fortunately, he'd thought to carve a key on the top of his bedside table, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to make sense of his masterpiece. They could barely make sense of it anyway. He flipped through several pages, copied exactly from his room. Adrotagia and her scholars had made notations here and there, offering theories on what various drawings and lists might mean. They wrote those in the women's script, which Taravangian had learned years ago. Adrotagia's notes on one page indicated that a picture there appeared to be a sketch of the mosaic on the floor of the Veden palace. He paused on that page. It might have relevance to this day's activities. Unfortunately, he wasn't smart enough today to make much sense of the book or its secrets. He had to trust that his smarter self was correct in his interpretations of his even smarter self's genius. He shut the book and put down his spoon. "Let us be on with it." He stood up and left the cabin, Mrall on one side of him and Adrotagia on the other. He emerged into sunlight and to the sight of a smoldering coastal city, complete with enormous terraced formationslike plates, or sections of shalebark, the remnants of city covering them and practically spilling over the sides. Once, this sight had been wondrous. Now, it was black, the buildingseven the palace destroyed. Vedenar, one of the great cities of the world, was now little more than a heap of rubble and ash. Taravangian idled by the rail. When his ship had sailed into the harbor the night before, the city had been dotted with the red glow of burning buildings. Those had seemed alive. More alive than this. The wind was blowing in off the ocean, pushing at him from behind. It swept the smoke inland, away from the ship, so that Taravangian could barely smell it. An entire city burned just beyond his fingertips, and yet the stench vanished into the wind. The Weeping would come soon. Perhaps it would wash away some of this destruction. "Come, Vargo," Adrotagia said. "They are waiting." He nodded, joining her in climbing into the rowboat for tendering to shore. There had once been grand docks for this city. No more. One faction had destroyed them in an attempt to keep out the others. "It's amazing," Mrall said, settling down into the tender beside him. "I thought you said you weren't going to be pleased any longer," Taravangian said, stomach turning as he saw one of the heaps at the edge of the city. Bodies. "I am not pleased," Mrall said, "but in awe. Do you realize that the Eighty's War between Emul and Tukar has lasted six years, and hasn't produced nearly this level of desolation? Jah Keved ate itself in a matter of months!" "Soulcasters," Adrotagia whispered. It was more than that. Even in his painfully normal state, Taravangian could see it was so. Yes, with Soulcasters to provide food and water, armies could march at speedno carts or supply lines to slow themand commence a slaughter in almost no time at all. But Emul and Tukar had their share of Soulcasters as well. Sailors started rowing them toward shore. "There was more," Mrall said. "Each highprince sought to seize the capital. That made them converge. It was almost like the wars of some Northern savages, with a time and place appointed for the shaking of spears and chanting of threats. Only here, it depopulated a kingdom." "Let us hope, Mrall, that you make an overstatement," Taravangian said. "We will need this kingdom's people." He turned away, stifling a moment of emotion as he saw bodies upon the rocks of the shore, men who had died by being shoved over the side of a nearby cliff into the ocean. That ridge normally sheltered the dock from highstorms. In war, it had been used to kill, one army pressing the other back off the drop. Adrotagia saw his tears, and though she said nothing, she pursed her lips in disapproval. She did not like how emotional he became when he was low of intellect. And yet, he knew for a fact that the old woman still burned a glyphward each morning as a prayer for her deceased husband. A strangely devout action for blasphemers such as they. "What is the day's news from home?" Taravangian asked to draw attention from the tears he wiped away. "Dova reports that the number of Death Rattles we're finding has dropped even further. She didn't find a single one yesterday, and only two the day before." "Moelach moves, then," Taravangian said. "It is certain now. The creature must have been drawn by something westward." What now? Did Taravangian suspend the murders? His heart yearned tobut if they could discover even one more glimmer about the future, one fact that could save hundreds of thousands, would it not be worth the lives of the few now? "Tell Dova to continue the work," he said. He had not anticipated that their covenant would attract the loyalty of an ardent, of all things. The Diagram, and its members, knew no boundaries. Dova had discovered their work on her own, and they'd needed to either induct her or assassinate her. "It will be done," Adrotagia said. The boatmen moved them up alongside some smoother rocks at the harbor's edge, then hopped out into the water. The men were servants of his, and were part of the Diagram. He trusted them, for he needed to trust some people. "Have you researched that other matter I requested?" Taravangian asked. "It is a difficult matter to answer," Adrotagia said. "The exact intelligence of a man is impossible to measure; even your tests only give us an approximation. The speed at which you answer questions and the way you answer them . . . well, it lets us make a judgment, but it is a crude one." The boatmen hauled them up onto the stony beach with ropes. Wood scraped stone with an awful sound. At least it covered up the moans in the near distance. Adrotagia took a sheet from her pocket and unfolded it. Upon it was a graph, with dots plotted in a kind of hump shape, a small trail to the left rising to a mountain in the center, then falling off in a similar curve to the right. "I took your last five hundred days' test results and assigned each one a number between zero and ten," Adrotagia said. "A representation of how intelligent you were that day, though as I said, it is not exact." "The hump near the middle?" Taravangian asked, pointing. "When you were average intelligence," Adrotagia said. "You spend most of your time near there, as you can see. Days of pure intelligence and days of ultimate stupidity are both rare. I had to extrapolate from what we had, but I think this graph is somewhat accurate." Taravangian nodded, then allowed one of the boatmen to help him debark. He had known that he spent more days average than he did otherwise. What he had asked her to figure out, however, was when he could expect another day like the one during which he'd created the Diagram. It had been years now since that day of transcendent mastery. She climbed out of the boat and Mrall followed. She stepped up to him with her sheet. "So this is where I was most intelligent," Taravangian said, pointing at the last point on the chart. It was far to the right, and very close to the bottom. A representation of high intelligence and a low frequency of occurrence. "This was that day, that day of perfection." "No," Adrotagia said. "What?" "That was the time you were the most intelligent during the last five hundred days," Adrotagia explained. "This point represents the day you finished the most complex problems you'd left for yourself, and the day you devised new ones for use in future tests." "I remember that day," he said. "It was when I solved Fabrisan's Conundrum." "Yes," she said. "The world may thank you for that, someday, if it survives." "I was smart on that day," he said. Smart enough that Mrall had declared he needed to be locked in the palace, lest he reveal his nature. He'd been convinced that if he could just explain his condition to the city, they would all listen to reason and let him control their lives perfectly. He'd drafted a law requiring that all people of less than average intellect be required to commit suicide for the good of the city. It had seemed reasonable. He had considered they might resist, but thought that the brilliance of the argument would sway them. Yes, he had been smart on that day. But not nearly as smart as the day of the Diagram. He frowned, inspecting the paper. "This is why I can't answer your question, Vargo," Adrotagia said. "That graph, it's what we call a logarithmic scale. Each step from that center point is not equalthey compound on one another the farther out you get. How smart were you on the day of the Diagram? Ten times smarter than your smartest otherwise?" "A hundred," Taravangian said, looking at the graph. "Maybe more. Let me do the calculations. . . ." "Aren't you stupid today?" "Not stupid. Average. I can figure this much. Each step to the side is . . ." "A measureable change in intelligence," she said. "You might say that each step sideways is a doubling of your intelligence, though that is hard to quantify. The steps upward are easier; they measure how frequently you have days of the given intelligence. So if you start at the center of the peak, you can see that for every five days you spend being average, you spend one day being mildly stupid and one day mildly smart. For every five of those, you spend one day moderately stupid and one day moderately genius. For every five days like that . . ." Taravangian stood on the rocks, his soldiers waiting above, as he counted on the graph. He moved sideways off the graph until he reached the point where he guessed the day of the Diagram might have been. Even that seemed conservative to him. "Almighty above . . ." he whispered. Thousands of days. Thousands upon thousands. "It should never have happened." "Of course it should have," she said. "But it's so unlikely as to be impossible!" "It's perfectly possible," she said. "The likelihood of it having happened is one, as it already occurred. That is the oddity of outliers and probability, Taravangian. A day like that could happen again tomorrow. Nothing forbids it. It's all pure chance, so far as I can determine. But if you want to know the likelihood of it happening again . . ." He nodded. "If you were to live another two thousand years, Vargo," she said, "you'd maybe have one single day like this among them. Maybe. Even odds, I'd say." Mrall snorted. "So it was luck." "No, it was simple probability." "Either way," Taravangian said, folding the paper. "This was not the answer I wanted." "Since when has it mattered what we want?" "Never," he said. "And it never will." He tucked the sheet into his pocket. They picked their way up the rocks, passing corpses bloated from too long in the sun, and joined a small group of soldiers at the top of the beach. They wore the burntorange crest of Kharbranth. He had few soldiers to his name. The Diagram called for his nation to be unthreatening. The Diagram was not perfect, however. They caught errors in it now and then. Or . . . not truly errors, just missed guesses. Taravangian had been supremely brilliant that day, but he had not been able to see the future. He had made educated guessesvery educatedand had been right an eerie amount of the time. But the farther they went from that day and the knowledge he'd had then, the more the Diagram needed tending and cultivation to stay on course. That was why he'd hoped for another such day soon, a day to revamp the Diagram. That would not come, most likely. They would have to continue, trusting in that man that he had once been, trusting his vision and understanding. Better that than anything else in this world. Gods and religion had failed them. Kings and highlords were selfish, petty things. If he was going to trust one thing to believe in, it would be himself and the raw genius of a human mind unfettered. It was difficult at times, though, to stay the course. Particularly when he faced the consequences of his actions. They entered the battlefield. Most of the fighting had apparently moved outside of the city, once the fire began. The men had continued warring even as their capital burned. Seven factions. The Diagram had guessed six. Would that matter? A soldier handed him a scented handkerchief to hold over his face as they passed the dead and dying. Blood and smoke. Scents he would come to know all too well before this was through. Men and women in the burntorange livery of Kharbranth picked through the dead and wounded. Throughout the East, the color had become synonymous with healing. Indeed, tents flying his bannerthe banner of the surgeondotted the battlefield. Taravangian's healers had arrived just before the battle, and had started ministering to the wounded immediately. As he left the fields of the dead, Veden soldiers began to stand up from where they sat in a dulleyed stupor at the edges of the battlefield. Then they started to cheer him. "Pali's mind," Adrotagia said, watching them rise. "I don't believe it." The soldiers sat separated in groups by banner, being tended to by Taravangian's surgeons, waterbearers, and comforters. Wounded and unwounded alike, any who could stand rose for the king of Kharbranth and cheered him. "The Diagram said it would happen," Taravangian said. "I thought for certain that was an error," she replied, shaking her head. "They know," Mrall said. "We are the only victors this day. Our healers, who earned the respect of all sides. Our comforters who helped the dying pass. Their highlords brought them only misery. You brought them life and hope." "I brought them death," Taravangian whispered. He had ordered the execution of their king, along with specific highprinces the Diagram indicated. In doing so, he had pushed the various factions into war with one another. He had brought this kingdom to its knees. Now they cheered him for it. He forced himself to stop with one of the groups, asking after their health, seeing if there was anything he could do for them. It was important to be seen by the people as a compassionate man. The Diagram explained this in casual sterility, as if compassion were something one could measure in a cup next to a pint of blood. He visited another group of soldiers, then a third. Many stepped up to him, touching his arms or his robe, weeping tears of thanks and joy. Many more of the Veden soldiers remained sitting in the tents, however, staring out over the fields of dead. Numb of mind. "The Thrill?" he whispered to Adrotagia as they left the latest group of men. "They fought through the night as their capital burned. It must have been in force." "I agree," she said. "It gives us a further reference point. The Thrill is at least as strong here as it is in Alethkar. Maybe stronger. I will speak to our scholars. Perhaps this will help pinpoint Nergaoul." "Do not spend too much effort on that," Taravangian said, approaching another group of Veden soldiers. "I'm not sure what we would even do if we found the thing." An ancient, evil spren was not something he had the resources to tackle. Not yet at least. "I would rather know where Moelach is moving." Hopefully, Moelach hadn't decided to slumber again. The Death Rattles had, so far, offered them the best way that they'd found to augment the Diagram. There was one answer, however, he'd never been able to determine. One he'd give almost anything to know. Would all of this be enough? He met with the soldiers, and adopted the air of a kindlyif not brightold man. Caring and helpful. He was almost that man in truth, today. He tried to do an imitation of himself when he was a little dumber. People accepted that man, and when he was of that intellect, he did not need to feign compassion nearly as much as he did when smarter. Blessed with intelligence, cursed with compassion to feel pain for what he had done. They came inversely. Why couldn't he have both at once? He did not think that in other people, intelligence and compassion were tied in such a way. The Nightwatcher's motives behind her boons and curses were unfathomable. Taravangian moved through the crowd of men, listening to them beg for more relief and for drugs to ease their pain. Listening to their thanks. These soldiers had suffered a fight thateven yetseemed to have no victor. They wanted something to hold to, and Taravangian was neutral, supposedly. It was shocking how easily they bared their souls to him. He came to the next soldier in line, a cloaked man clutching an apparently broken arm. Taravangian looked into the man's hooded eyes. It was SzethsonsonVallano. Taravangian felt a moment of sheer panic. "We need to speak," the Shin man said. Taravangian grabbed the assassin by the arm, hauling him away from the crowd of Veden soldiers. With his other hand, Taravangian felt in his pocket for the Oathstone he carried on his person at all times. He pulled it out just to see. Yes, it was no fake. Damnation, seeing Szeth there had made him think that he'd been bested somehow, the stone stolen and Szeth sent to kill him. Szeth let himself be pulled away. What had he said? That he needed to talk, you fool, Taravangian thought to himself. If he'd come to kill you, you would be dead. Had Szeth been seen here? What would people say if they saw Taravangian interacting with a bald Shin man? Rumors had started from less. If anyone got even a hint that Taravangian had been involved with the infamous Assassin in White . . . Mrall noticed immediately that something was wrong. He barked orders to the guards, separating Taravangian from the Veden soldiers. Adrotagiawho had been sitting with crossed arms nearby, watching and tapping her footleaped to stride over. She peeked at the person under the hood, then gasped, the color draining from her face. "How dare you come here?" Taravangian said to Szeth, speaking under his breath while maintaining a cheerful pose and expression. He was of only average intelligence today, but he was still a king, raised and trained to the court. He could maintain his composure. "A problem has arisen," Szeth said, face hooded, voice emotionless. Speaking to this creature was like speaking to one of the dead themselves. "Why have you failed to kill Dalinar Kholin?" Adrotagia demanded with quiet urgency. "We know you fled. Return and do the job!" Szeth glanced at her, but did not reply. She did not hold his Oathstone. He did seem to note her, however, with those tooblank eyes of his. Damnation. Their plan had been to keep Szeth from meeting or knowing of Adrotagia, just in case he decided to turn against Taravangian and kill him. The Diagram hypothesized this possibility. "Kholin has a Surgebinder," Szeth said. So, Szeth knew about Jasnah. Had she faked her death, then, as he'd suspected? Damnation. The battlefield seemed to grow still. To Taravangian, the moans of the wounded faded away. Everything narrowed to just him and Szeth. Those eyes. The tone of the man's voice. A dangerous tone. What He spoke with emotion, Taravangian realized. That last sentence was said with passion. It had sounded like a plea. As if Szeth's voice were being squeezed on the sides. This man was not sane. SzethsonsonVallano was the most dangerous weapon on all of Roshar, and he was broken. Storms, why couldn't this have happened on a day when Taravangian had more than half a wit? "What makes you say this?" Taravangian said, trying to buy time for his mind to lumber through the implications. He held Szeth's Oathstone before him, almost as if it could chase away problems like a superstitious woman's glyphward. "I fought him," Szeth said. "He protected Kholin." "Ah, yes," Taravangian said, thinking furiously. Szeth had been banished from Shinovar, made Truthless for something relating to a claim that the Voidbringers had returned. If he discovered that he wasn't wrong about that claim, then what Him? "You fought a Surgebinder?" Adrotagia said, glancing at Taravangian. "Yes," Szeth said. "An Alethi man who fed upon Stormlight. He healed a Bladesevered arm. He is . . . Radiant . . ." That strain in his voice did not sound safe. Taravangian glanced at Szeth's hands. They were clenching into fists time and time again, like hearts beating. "No, no," Taravangian said. "I have learned this only recently. Yes, it makes sense now. One of the Honorblades has vanished." Szeth blinked, and he focused on Taravangian, as if returning from a distant place. "One of the other seven?" "Yes," Taravangian said. "I have heard only hints. Your people are secretive. But yes . . . I see, it is one of the two that allow Regrowth. Kholin must have it." Szeth swayed back and forth, though he did not seem conscious of the motion. Even now, he moved with a fighter's grace. Storms. "This man I fought," Szeth said, "he summoned no Blade." "But he used Stormlight," Taravangian said. "Yes." "So he must have an Honorblade." "I . . ." "It is the only explanation." "It . . ." Szeth's voice grew colder. "Yes, the only explanation. I will kill him and retrieve it." "No," Taravangian said firmly. "You are to return to Dalinar Kholin and do the task assigned you. Do not fight this other man. Attack when he is not present." "But" "Have I your Oathstone?" Taravangian demanded. "Is my word to be questioned?" Szeth stopped swaying. His gaze locked with Taravangian's. "I am Truthless. I do as my master requires, and I do not ask for an explanation." "Stay away from the man with the Honorblade," Taravangian repeated. "Kill Dalinar." "It will be done." Szeth turned and strode away. Taravangian wanted to yell further instructions. Don't be seen! Don't ever come to me in public again! Instead, he sat right there on the path, composure crumbling. He gasped, trembling, sweat streaming down his brow. "Stormfather," Adrotagia said, settling on the ground beside him. "I thought we were dead." Servants brought Taravangian a chair while Mrall made excuses for him. The king is overcome with grief at the deaths of so many. He is old, you know. And so caring . . . Taravangian breathed in and out, struggling to regain control. He looked to Adrotagia, who sat in the middle of a circle of servants and soldiers, all sworn to the Diagram. "Who is it?" he asked softly. "Who is this Surgebinder?" "Jasnah's ward?" Adrotagia said. They had been startled when that one arrived on the Shattered Plains. Already they hypothesized that the girl had been trained. If not by Jasnah, then by the girl's brother, before his death. "No," Taravangian said. "A male. One of Dalinar's family members?" He thought for a time. "We need the Diagram itself." She went to fetch it from the ship. Nothing elsehis visits to the soldiers, more important meetings with Veden leadersmattered right now. The Diagram was off. They strayed into dangerous territory. She returned with it, and with the stormwardens, who set up a tent around Taravangian right there on the path. Excuses continued. The king is weak from the sun. He must rest and burn glyphwards to the Almighty for the preservation of your nation. Taravangian cares while your own lighteyes sent you to the slaughter . . . By the light of spheres, Taravangian picked through the tome, poring over translations of his own words written in a language he had invented and then forgotten. Answers. He needed answers. "Did ever I tell you, Adro, what I asked for?" he whispered as he read. "Yes." He was barely listening. "Capacity," he whispered, turning a page. "Capacity to stop what was coming. The capacity to save humankind." He searched. He was not brilliant today, but he had spent many days reading these pages, going over, and over, and over passages. He knew them. The answers would be here. They would. Taravangian worshipped only one god now. It was the man he had been on that day. There. He found it on a reproduction of one corner of his room, where he'd written in tiny script sentences over the top of one another because he'd run out of space. In his clarity of genius, the sentences had looked easy to separate, but it had taken his scholars years to piece together what this said. They will come. You cannot stop their oaths. Look for those who survive when they should not. That pattern will be your clue. "The bridgemen," Taravangian whispered. "What?" Adrotagia asked. Taravangian looked up, blinking bleary eyes. "Dalinar's bridgemen, the ones he took from Sadeas. Did you read the account of their survival?" "I didn't think it important. Just another game of power between Sadeas and Dalinar." "No. It's more." They had survived. Taravangian stood up. "Wake every Alethi sleeper we have; send every agent in the area. There will be stories told of one of these bridgemen. Miraculous survival. Favored of the winds. One is among them. He might not know yet exactly what he's doing, but he has bonded a spren and sworn at least the First Ideal." "If we find him?" Adrotagia asked. "We keep him away from Szeth at all costs." Taravangian handed her the Diagram. "Our lives depend upon it. Szeth is a beast who gnaws at his leg to escape his bonds. If he gets free . . ." She nodded, moving off to do as he commanded. She hesitated at the flaps to their temporary tent. "We might have to reassess our methods of determining your intelligence. What I have seen in the last hour makes me question whether 'average' can be applied to you today." "The assessments are not inaccurate," he said. "You simply underestimate the average man." Besides, in dealing with the Diagram, he might not remember what he had written or whybut there were echoes sometimes. She left, making way as Mrall stepped in. "Your Majesty," he said. "Time runs short. The highprince is dying." "He's been dying for years." Still, Taravangian did hasten his stepas much as he was capable of doing these daysas he resumed his hike. He didn't stop with any more of the soldiers, and gave only brief waves toward the cheers he received. Eventually, Mrall led him over a hillside away from the immediate stench of the battle and the smoldering city. A series of stormwagons here flew an optimistic flag, that of the king of Jah Keved. The guards there let Taravangian enter their ring of wagons, and he approached the largest one, an enormous vehicle almost like a mobile building on wheels. They found Highprince Valam . . . King Valam . . . in bed coughing. His hair had fallen out since Taravangian had last seen him, and his cheeks were so sunken that rainwater would have pooled in them. Redin, the king's bastard son, stood at the foot of the bed, head bowed. With the three guards who stood in the room, there wasn't room for Taravangian, so he stopped in the doorway. "Taravangian," Valam said, then coughed into his handkerchief. The cloth came back bloodied. "You've come for my kingdom, have you?" "I don't know what you mean, Your Majesty," Taravangian said. "Don't play coy," Valam snapped. "I can't stand it in women or in rivals. Stormfather . . . I don't know what they're going to make of you. I half think they'll have you assassinated by the end of the week." He waved with a sickly hand, all draped in cloth, and the guards made way for Taravangian to enter the small bedchamber. "Clever ploy," the king said. "Sending that food, those healers. The soldiers love you, I've heard. What would you have done if one side had won decisively?" "I'd have had a new ally," Taravangian said. "Grateful for my aid." "You helped all sides." "But the winner the most, Your Majesty," Taravangian said. "We can minister to survivors, but not the dead." Valam coughed again, a great hacking mess. His bastard stepped up, concerned, but the king waved him back. "Would have figured," the king said to him between wheezes, "you'd be the only one of my children to live, bastard." He turned to Taravangian. "Turns out, you have a legitimate claim on the throne, Taravangian. Through your mother's side, I think? A marriage to a Veden princess some three generations back?" "I am not aware," Taravangian said. "Didn't you hear me about being coy?" "We both have a role to play in this production, Your Majesty," Taravangian said. "I am merely speaking the lines as they were written." "You talk like a woman," Valam said. He spat blood to the side. "I know what you're up to. In a week or so, after caring for my people, your scribes will 'discover' your claim on the throne. You'll reluctantly step in to save the kingdom, as urged by my own storming people." "I see you've had the script read to you," Taravangian said softly. "That assassin will come for you." "He very well might." That was the truth. "Don't know why I even storming tried for this throne," Valam said. "At least I'll die as king." He heaved a deep breath, then raised his hand, gesturing impatiently at the scribes huddled outside the room. The women perked up, peeking around Taravangian. "I'm making this idiot my heir," Valam said, waving at Taravangian. "Ha! Let the other highprinces chew on that." "They're dead, Your Majesty," Taravangian said. "What? All of them?" "Yes." "Even Boriar?" "Yes." "Huh," Valam said. "Bastard." At first, Taravangian thought that was a reference to one of the deceased. Then, however, he noticed the king waving at his illegitimate son. Redin stepped up, going onto one knee beside the bed as Taravangian made room. Valam struggled with something beneath his blankets; his side knife. Redin helped him get it out, then held the knife awkwardly. Taravangian inspected this Redin, curious. This was the king's ruthless executioner that he had read about? This concerned, helplesslooking man? "Through my heart," Valam said. "Father, no . . ." Redin said. "Through my storming heart!" Valam shouted, spraying bloody spittle across his sheet. "I won't lie here and let Taravangian coax my own servants into poisoning me. Do it, boy! Or can't you do a single thing that" Redin slammed the knife down into his father's chest with such force, it made Taravangian jump. Redin then stood, saluted, and shoved his way out of the room. The king heaved a final gasp, eyes glazing over. "So the night will reign, for the choice of honor is life . . ." Taravangian raised an eyebrow. A Death Rattle? Here, now? Blast, and he wasn't in a position where he could write down the exact phrasing. He'd have to remember it. Valam's life faded away until he was simply meat. A Shardblade appeared from vapor beside the bed, then thumped to the wooden floor of the wagon. Nobody reached for it, and the soldiers in the room and scribes outside it looked to Taravangian, then knelt. "Cruel, what Valam did to that one," Mrall said, nodding toward the bastard, who shoved his way out of the stormwagon and into the light. "More than you know," Taravangian said, reaching out to touch the knife protruding through blanket and clothing from the old king's chest. He hesitated, fingers inches from the handle. "The bastard will be known as a patricide on the official records. If he had interest in the throne, this will make it . . . difficult for him, even more so than his parentage." Taravangian pulled his fingers away from the knife. "Might I have a moment with the fallen king? I would speak a prayer for him." The others left him, even Mrall. They shut the small door, and Taravangian sat down on the stool beside the corpse. He had no intention of saying any sort of prayer, but he did want a moment. Alone. To think. It had worked. Just as the Diagram instructed, Taravangian was king of Jah Keved. He had taken the first major step toward unifying the world, as Gavilar had insisted would need to happen if they were to survive. That was, at least, what the visions had proclaimed. Visions Gavilar had confided in him six years ago, the night of the Alethi king's death. Gavilar had seen visions of the Almighty, who was also now dead, and of a coming storm. Unite them. "I am doing my best, Gavilar," Taravangian whispered. "I am sorry that I need to kill your brother." That would not be the only sin upon his head when this was done. Not by a faint breeze or a stormwind. He wished, once again, that this day had been a day of brilliance. Then he wouldn't have felt so guilty. They will come you cannot stop their oaths look for those who survive when they should not that pattern will be your clue. From the Diagram, Coda of the Northwest Bottom Corner: paragraph 3 You have killed her. . . . Kaladin couldn't sleep. He knew he should sleep. He lay in his dark barrack room, surrounded by familiar stone, comfortable for the first time in days. A soft pillow, a mattress as good as the one he'd had back home in Hearthstone. His body felt wrung out, like a rag after the washing was done. He'd survived the chasms and brought Shallan home safely. Now he needed to sleep and heal. You have killed her. . . . He sat up in his bed, and felt a wave of dizziness. He gritted his teeth and let it pass. His leg wound throbbed inside his bandage. The camp surgeons had done a good job with that; his father would have been pleased. The camp outside felt too quiet. After showering him with praise and enthusiasm, the men of Bridge Four had gone to join the army for its expedition, along with all of the other bridge crews, who would be carrying bridges for the army. Only a small force from Bridge Four would remain behind to guard the king. Kaladin reached out in the darkness, feeling beside the wall until he found his spear. He took hold, then propped himself up and stood. The leg flared with immediate pain, and he gritted his teeth, but it wasn't so bad. He'd taken fathom bark for the pain, and it was working. He'd refused the firemoss the surgeons had tried to give him. His father had hated using the addictive stuff. Kaladin forced his way to the door of his small room, then shoved it open and stepped into the sunlight. He shaded his eyes and scanned the sky. No clouds yet. The Weeping, the worst part of the year, would roll in sometime tomorrow. Four weeks of ceaseless rain and gloom. It was a Light Year, so not even a highstorm in the middle. Misery. Kaladin longed for the storm within. That would have awakened his mind, made him feel like moving. "Hey, gancho?" Lopen said, popping up from where he sat beside the firepit. "You need something?" "Let's go watch the army leave." "You're not supposed to be walking, I think. . . ." "I'll be fine," Kaladin said, hobbling with difficulty. Lopen rushed over to help him, getting up under Kaladin's arm, lifting weight off the bad leg. "Why don't you glow a bit, gon?" Lopen asked softly. "Heal that problem?" He'd prepared a lie: something about not wanting to alert the surgeons by healing too quickly. He couldn't force it out. Not to a member of Bridge Four. "I've lost the ability, Lopen," he said softly. "Syl has left me." The lean Herdazian fell unusually silent. "Well," he finally said, "maybe you should buy her something nice." "Buy something nice? For a spren?" "Yeah. Like . . . I don't know. A nice plant, maybe, or a new hat. Yes, a hat. Might be cheap. She's small. If a tailor tries to charge you full price for a hat that small, you thump him real good." "That's the most ridiculous piece of advice I've ever been given." "You should rub yourself with curry and go prancing through the camp singing Horneater lullabies." Kaladin looked at Lopen, incredulous. "What?" "See? Now the bit about the hat is only the second most ridiculous piece of advice you've ever been given, so you should try it. Women like hats. I have this cousin who makes them. I can ask her. You might not even need the actual hat. Just the spren of the hat. That'll make it even cheaper." "You're a very special kind of weird, Lopen." "Of course I am, gon. There's only one of me." They continued through the empty camp. Storms, the place seemed hollow. They passed empty barrack after empty barrack. Kaladin walked with care, glad for Lopen's help, but even this was draining. He shouldn't be moving on the leg. Father's words, the words of a surgeon, floated up from the depths of his mind. Torn muscles. Bind the leg, ward against infection, and keep the subject from putting weight on it. Further tearing could lead to a permanent limp, or worse. "You want to get a palanquin?" Lopen asked. "Those are for women." "Ain't nothing wrong with being a woman, gancho," Lopen said. "Some of my relatives are women." "Of course they . . ." He trailed off at Lopen's grin. Storming Herdazian. How much of what he said was to deliberately sound obtuse? Well, Kaladin had heard men telling jokes about how stupid Herdazians were, but Lopen could talk rings around those men. Of course, half of Lopen's own jokes were about Herdazians. He seemed to find those extra funny. As they approached the plateaus, the dead silence gave way to the low roar of thousands of people assembled in a limited area. Kaladin and Lopen finally broke free of the barrack rows, emerging onto the natural terrace just above the parade grounds that debouched onto the Shattered Plains. Thousands of soldiers were gathered there. Spearmen in huge blocks, lighteyed archers in thinner ranks, officers prancing on horseback in gleaming armor. Kaladin gasped softly. "What?" Lopen asked. "It's what I always thought I'd find." "What? Today?" "As a young man in Alethkar," Kaladin said, unexpectedly emotional. "When I dreamed of the glory of war, this is what I imagined." He hadn't pictured the greenvines and barely capable soldiers that Amaram had trained in Alethkar. Neither had he pictured the crude, if effective, brutes of Sadeas's armyor even the quick strike teams of Dalinar's plateau runs. He'd imagined this. A full army, arrayed for a grand march. Spears held high, banners fluttering, drummers and trumpeters, messengers in livery, scribes on horses, even the king's Soulcasters in their own sectionedoff square, hidden from sight by walls of cloth carried on poles. Kaladin knew the truth of battle now. Fighting was not about glory, but about men lying on the ground screaming and thrashing, tangled in their own viscera. It was about bridgemen thrown against a wall of arrows, or of Parshendi cut down while they sang. Yet in this moment, Kaladin let himself dream again. He gave his youthful self still there deep inside himthe spectacle he'd always imagined. He pretended that these soldiers were about something wonderful, instead of just another pointless slaughter. "Hey, someone else is actually coming," Lopen said, pointing. "Look at that." By the banners, Dalinar had been joined by only a single highprince: Roion. However, as Lopen pointed out, another forcenot quite as large or as well organizedwas flowing northward up the wide, open pathway along the eastern rim of the warcamps. At least one other highprince had responded to Dalinar's call. "Let's find Bridge Four," Kaladin said. "I want to see the men off." * * * "Sebarial?" Dalinar asked. "Sebarial's troops are joining us?" Roion grunted, wringing his handsas if wishing to wash themas he sat in the saddle. "I guess we should be glad for any support at all." "Sebarial," Dalinar said, dumbfounded. "He wouldn't even send troops on close plateau runs, where there was no risk of Parshendi. Why would he send men now?" Roion shook his head and shrugged. Dalinar turned Gallant and trotted the horse toward the oncoming group, as did Roion. They passed Adolin, who rode just behind with Shallan, side by side, her guards and his following. Renarin was over with the bridgemen, of course. Shallan was riding one of Adolin's own horses, a petite gelding over which Sureblood towered. Shallan wore a traveling dress of the kind messenger women preferred, with the front and back slit all the way to the waist. She wore leggings basically silk trousers, but women preferred other namesunderneath. Behind them rode a large group of Navani's scholars and cartographers, including Isasik, the ardent who was the royal cartographer. These passed around the map Shallan had drawn, Isasik riding to the side, chin raised, as if pointedly ignoring the praise the women were giving Shallan's map. Dalinar needed all these scholars, though he wished he didn't. Each scribe he brought was another life he risked. That was made worse by Navani herself coming. He couldn't dismiss her argument. If you think it's safe enough for you to bring the girl, then it's safe enough for me. As Dalinar made his way toward Sebarial's oncoming procession, Amaram rode up, wearing his Shardplate, his golden cloak trailing behind. He had a fine warhorse, the hulking breed used in Shinovar to pull heavy carts. It still looked like a pony beside Gallant. "Is that Sebarial?" Amaram asked, pointing at the oncoming force. "Apparently." "Should we send him away?" "Why would we do that?" "He's untrustworthy," Amaram said. "He keeps his word, so far as I know," Dalinar said. "That is more than I can say for most." "He keeps his word because he never promises anything." Dalinar, Roion, and Amaram trotted up to Sebarial, who stepped out of a carriage at the front of the army. A carriage. For a war procession. Well, it wouldn't slow Dalinar any more than all of these scribes. In fact, he should probably have a few more carriages made ready. It would be nice for Navani to have a way to ride in comfort once the days wore long. "Sebarial?" Dalinar asked. "Dalinar!" the plump man said, shading his eyes. "You look surprised." "I am." "Ha! That's reason enough to have come. Wouldn't you say, Palona?" Dalinar could barely make out the woman sitting in the carriage, wearing an enormous fashionable hat and a sleek gown. "You brought your mistress?" Dalinar asked. "Sure. Why not? If we fail out there, I'll be dead and she'll be out on her ear. She insisted, anyway. Storming woman." Sebarial walked up right beside Gallant. "I've got a feeling about you, Dalinar old man. I think it's wise to stay close to you. Something's going to happen out there on the Plains, and opportunity rises like the dawn." Roion sniffed. "Roion," Sebarial said, "shouldn't you be hiding under a table somewhere?" "Perhaps I should, if only to get away from you." Sebarial laughed. "Well said, you old turtle! Maybe this trip won't be a complete bore. Onward, then! To glory and some such nonsense. If we find riches, remember that I get my part! I got here before Aladar. That has to count for something." "Before . . ." Dalinar said with a start. He twisted around, looking back toward the warcamp bordering his own to the north. There, an army wearing Aladar's colors of white and dark green spilled out onto the Shattered Plains. "Now that," Amaram said, "I really didn't expect." * * * "We could try a coup," Ialai said. Sadeas turned in his saddle toward his wife. Their guards scattered the hills around them, distant enough to be out of earshot as the highprince and his wife enjoyed a gentle "ride through the hills." In reality, the two of them had wanted a closer look at Sebarial's expansions out here west of the warcamps, where he was setting up fullscale farming operations. Ialai rode with eyes forward. "Dalinar will be gone from the camp, and with him Roion, his only supporter. We could seize the Pinnacle, execute the king, and take the throne." Sadeas turned his horse, looking eastward over the warcamps. He could just barely make out Dalinar's army gathering distantly on the Shattered Plains. A coup. One last step, a slap in the face of old Gavilar. He'd do it. Storm it, he would. Except for the fact that he didn't need to. "Dalinar has committed to this foolish expedition," Sadeas said. "He'll be dead soon, surrounded and destroyed on those Plains. We don't need a coup; if I'd known that he would actually do this, we wouldn't have even needed your assassin." Ialai looked away. Her assassin had failed. She considered it a strong fault on her part, though the plan had been executed with exactness. These things were never certain. Unfortunately, now that they'd tried and failed, they'd need to be careful about . . . Sadeas turned his horse, frowning as a messenger approached on horseback. The youth was allowed to pass the guards and proffered a letter to Ialai. She read it, and her disposition darkened. "You aren't going to like this," she said, looking up. * * * Dalinar kicked Gallant into motion, tearing across the landscape, startling plants into their dens. He passed his army in a few minutes of hard riding and approached the new force. Aladar sat on horseback here, surveying his army. He wore a fashionable uniform, black with maroon stripes on the sleeves and a matching stock at the neck. Soldiers swarmed around him. He had one of the largest forces on the Plainsstorms, with Dalinar's numbers reduced, Aladar's army might be the largest. He was also one of Sadeas's greatest supporters. "How are we going to do this, Dalinar?" Aladar asked as Dalinar trotted up. "Do we all go out on our own, crossing different plateaus but meeting back up, or do we march in an enormous column?" "Why?" Dalinar asked. "Why have you come?" "You made such passionate arguments all along, and now you act surprised that someone listened?" "Not someone. You." Aladar pressed his lips to a line, finally turning to meet Dalinar's eyes. "Roion and Sebarial, the two biggest cowards in our midst, are marching to war. Am I to stay behind and let them seek the fulfillment of the Vengeance Pact without me?" "The other highprinces seem content to do so." "I suspect they are better at lying to themselves than I am." Suddenly, all of Aladar's vehement argumentsat the forefront of the faction against Dalinartook on a different cast. He was arguing to convince himself, Dalinar thought. He was worried all along that I was right. "Sadeas will not be pleased," Dalinar said. "Sadeas can storm off. He doesn't own me." Aladar fiddled with his reins for a moment. "He wants to, though. I can feel it in the deals he forces me to make, the knives he slowly places at everyone's throats. He'd have us all as his slaves by the end of this." "Aladar," Dalinar said, moving his horse right up alongside the other man's so the two of them faced each other directly. He held Aladar's eyes. "Tell me Sadeas didn't put you up to this. Tell me this isn't part of another plot to abandon or betray me." Aladar smiled. "You think I'd just tell you if it were?" "I would hear a promise from your own lips." "And you'll trust that promise? How well did that serve you, Dalinar, when Sadeas professed his friendship?" "A promise, Aladar." Aladar met his eyes. "I think the things you say about Alethkar are naive at best, and undoubtedly impossible. Those delusions of yours aren't a sign of madness, as Sadeas wants us to thinkthey're just the dreams of a man who wants desperately to believe in something, something foolish. 'Honor' is a word applied to the actions of men from the past who have had their lives scrubbed clean by historians." He hesitated. "But . . . storm me for a fool, Dalinar, I wish they could be true. I came for myself, not Sadeas. I won't betray you. Even if Alethkar can't ever be what you want, we can at least crush the Parshendi and avenge old Gavilar. It's just the right thing to do." Dalinar nodded. "I could be lying," Aladar said. "But you aren't." "How do you know?" "Honestly? I don't. But if this is all going to work, I am going to have to trust some of you." To an extent. He would never put himself in another position like the Tower. Either way, Aladar's presence meant this incursion was actually possible. Together, the four of them would likely outnumber the Parshendithough he wasn't certain how trustworthy the scribes' counts of their numbers were. It was not the grand coalition of all highprinces that Dalinar had wanted, but even with the chasms favoring the Parshendi, this could be enough. "We march together," Dalinar said, pointing. "I don't want us spread out. We keep to plateaus next to one another, or the same plateau when possible. And you'll need to leave your parshmen behind." "That's an unusual requirement," Aladar said with a frown. "We're marching against their cousins," Dalinar said. "Best to not risk the possibility of them turning against us." "But they'd never . . . Bah, whatever. It can be done." Dalinar nodded, extending a hand to Aladar as, behind, Roion and Amaram finally trotted up; Dalinar had outstripped them on Gallant. "Thank you," Dalinar said to Aladar. "You really do believe in all of this, don't you?" "Yes." Aladar extended his hand, but hesitated. "You realize that I'm stained through and through. I've got blood on these hands, Dalinar. I'm not some perfect, honorable knight as you seem to want to pretend." "I know you're not," Dalinar said, taking the hand. "I'm not either. We will have to do." They shared a nod, then Dalinar turned Gallant and began to trot back toward his own army. Roion groaned, complaining about his thighs after having galloped all the way over. The ride today was not going to be pleasant for him. Amaram fell in beside Dalinar. "First Sebarial, then Aladar? Your trust seems to come cheaply today, Dalinar." "Would you have me turn them away?" "Think how spectacular this victory would be if we did it on our own." "I hope we're above such vainglory, old friend," Dalinar said. They rode for a time, passing Adolin and Shallan again. Dalinar scanned his force and noticed something. A tall man in blue sat on a stone in the midst of Bridge Four's bodyguards. Speaking of fools . . . "Come with me," Dalinar said to Amaram. Amaram let his horse lag behind. "I think I should go see to" "Come," Dalinar said sharply. "I want you to speak to that young man so we can put a stop to the rumors and the things he's been saying about you. Those don't do anyone any good." "Very well," Amaram said, catching up. * * * Kaladin found himself standing up amid the bridgemen, despite the pain of his leg, as he noticed Adolin and Shallan riding past. He followed the pair with his eyes. Adolin, astride his thickhooved Ryshadium, and Shallan on a more modestly sized brown animal. She looked gorgeous. Kaladin was willing to admit it, if only to himself. Brilliant red hair, ready smile. She said something clever; Kaladin could almost hear the words. He waited, hoping that she'd look toward him, meet his eyes across the short distance. She didn't. She rode on, and Kaladin felt like an utter fool. A part of him wanted to hate Adolin for holding her attention, but he found that he couldn't. The truth was, he liked Adolin. And those two were good for one another. They fit. Perhaps Kaladin could hate that. He settled back down on a rock, bowing his head. The bridgemen crowded in around him. Hopefully they hadn't seen Kaladin following Shallan with his eyes, straining to hear her voice. Renarin stood, like a shade, at the back of the group. The bridgemen were coming to accept him, but he still seemed very awkward around them. Of course, he seemed awkward around most people. I need to talk to him more about his condition, Kaladin thought. Something seemed off to him about that man and his explanation of the epilepsy. "Why are you here, sir?" Bisig asked, drawing Kaladin's attention back to the other bridgemen. "I wanted to see you off," Kaladin said, sighing. "I assumed you'd be happy to see me." "You are like child," Rock said, wagging a thick finger at Kaladin. "What would you do, great Captain Stormblessed, if you caught one of these men walking about with hurt leg? You would have that man beaten! Once he healed, of course." "I thought," Kaladin noted, "that I was your commander." "Nah, can't be," Teft said, "because our commander would be smart enough to stay in bed." "And eat much stew," Rock said. "I left you stew to eat while I am gone." "You're going on the expedition?" Kaladin asked, looking up at the large Horneater. "I thought you were just seeing the men off. You aren't willing to fight. What will you do out there?" "Someone must fix food for them," Rock said. "This expedition, it will take days. I will not leave my friends to the mercy of camp chefs. Ha! The food they cook will all be from Soulcast grain and meat. Tastes like crem! Someone must come with proper spices." Kaladin looked up at the group of frowning men. "Fine," he said. "I'll go back. Storms, I . . ." Why were the bridgemen parting? Rock looked over his shoulder, then laughed, backing away. "Now we shall see real trouble." Behind them, Dalinar Kholin was climbing from his saddle. Kaladin sighed, then waved for Lopen to help him to his feet so he could salute properly. He got uprightearning a glare from Teftbefore noticing that Dalinar was not alone. Amaram. Kaladin stiffened, straining to keep his face expressionless. Dalinar and Amaram approached. The pain in Kaladin's leg seemed to fade, and for the moment he could only see that man. That monster of a man. Wearing Plate Kaladin had earned, a golden cloak billowing out behind, bearing the symbol of the Knights Radiant. Control yourself, Kaladin thought. He managed to swallow his rage. Last time it had gotten the better of him, he'd earned himself weeks in prison. "You should be resting, soldier," Dalinar said. "Yes, sir," Kaladin replied. "My men have already made that abundantly clear." "Then you trained them well. I'm proud to have them along with me on this expedition." Teft saluted. "If there is danger to you, Brightlord, it will be out there on the Plains. We can't protect you if we wait back here." Kaladin frowned, realizing something. "Skar is here . . . Teft . . . so who is watching the king?" "We've seen to it, sir," Teft said. "Brightlord Dalinar asked me leave our best man behind with a team of his own selection. They'll watch the king." Their best man . . . Coldness. Moash. Moash had been left in charge of the king's safety, and had a team of his own choosing. Storms. "Amaram," Dalinar said, waving for the highlord to step up. "You told me that you'd never seen this man before arriving here on the Shattered Plains. Is that true?" Kaladin met the eyes of a murderer. "Yes," Amaram said. "What of his claim that you took your Blade and Plate from him?" Dalinar asked. "Brightlord," Amaram said, taking Dalinar by the arm, "I don't know if the lad is touched in the head or merely starved for attention. Perhaps he served in my army, as he claimshe certainly bears the correct slave brand. But his allegations regarding me are obviously preposterous." Dalinar nodded to himself, as if this were all expected. "I believe an apology is due." Kaladin struggled to remain upright, his leg feeling weak. So this would be his final punishment. Apologizing to Amaram in public. A humiliation above all others. "I" Kaladin began. "Not you, son," Dalinar said softly. Amaram turned, posture suddenly more alertlike that of a man preparing for a fight. "Surely you don't believe these allegations, Dalinar!" "A few weeks ago," Dalinar said, "I received two special visitors in camp. One was a trusted servant who had come from Kholinar in secret, bringing a precious cargo. The other was that cargo: a madman who had arrived at the gates of Kholinar carrying a Shardblade." Amaram paled and stepped back, hand going to his side. "I told my servant," Dalinar said calmly, "to go drinking with your personal guardhe knew many of themand talk of a treasure that the madman said had been hidden for years outside the warcamp. By my order, he then placed the madman's Shardblade in a nearby cavern. After that, we waited." He's summoning his Blade, Kaladin thought, looking at Amaram's hand. Kaladin reached for his side knife, but Dalinar was already raising his own hand. White mist coalesced in Dalinar's fingers, and a Shardblade appeared, tip to Amaram's throat. Wider than most, it was almost cleaverlike in appearance. A Blade formed in Amaram's hand a second latera second too late. His eyes went wide as he stared at the silvery Blade held to his throat. Dalinar had a Shardblade. "I thought," Dalinar said, "that if you had been willing to murder for one Blade, you would certainly be willing to lie for a second. And so, after I knew you'd sneaked in to see the madman on your own, I asked you to investigate his claims for me. I gave your conscience plenty of time to come clean, out of respect for our friendship. When you told me you'd found nothingbut in fact you had actually recovered the ShardbladeI knew the truth." "How?" Amaram hissed, looking at the Blade Dalinar held. "How did you get it back? I removed it from the cave. My men had it safe!" "I wasn't about to risk it just to prove a point," Dalinar said, cold. "I bonded this Blade before we hid it away." "That week you spent ill," Amaram said. "Yes." "Damnation." Dalinar exhaled, a hissing sound through his teeth. "Why, Amaram? Of all people, I thought that you . . . Bah!" Dalinar's grip on the weapon tightened, knuckles white. Amaram raised his chin, as if thrusting his neck toward the point of the Shardblade. "I did it," Amaram said, "and I would do it again. The Voidbringers will soon return, and we must be strong enough to face them. That means practiced, accomplished Shardbearers. In sacrificing a few of my soldiers, I planned to save many more." "Lies!" Kaladin said, stumbling forward. "You just wanted the Blade for yourself!" Amaram looked Kaladin in the eyes. "I am sorry for what I did to you and yours. Sometimes, good men must die so that greater goals may be accomplished." Kaladin felt a gathering chill, a numbness that spread from his heart outward. He's telling the truth, he thought. He . . . honestly believes that he did the right thing. Amaram dismissed his Blade, turning back to Dalinar. "What now?" "You are guilty of murderof killing men for personal wealth." "And what is it," Amaram said, "when you send thousands of men to their deaths so that you may secure gemhearts, Dalinar? Is that different somehow? We all know that sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good." "Take off that cloak," Dalinar growled. "You are no Radiant." Amaram reached up and undid it, then dropped it to the rock. He turned and started to walk away. "No!" Kaladin said, stumbling after him. "Let him go, son," Dalinar said, sighing. "His reputation is broken." "He is still a murderer." "And we will try him fairly," Dalinar said, "once I return. I can't imprison him Shardbearers are above that, and he'd cut his way out anyway. Either you execute a Shardbearer or you leave him free." Kaladin sagged, and Lopen appeared on one side, holding him up while Teft got under his other arm. He felt drained. Sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good. . . . "Thank you," Kaladin said to Dalinar, "for believing me." "I do listen sometimes, soldier," Dalinar said. "Now go back to camp and get some rest." Kaladin nodded. "Sir? Stay safe out there." Dalinar smiled grimly. "If possible. At least now I've got a way to fight that assassin, if he arrives. With all of these Shardblades flying around lately, I figured having one myself made too much sense to ignore." He narrowed his eyes, turning eastward. "Even if it feels . . . wrong somehow to hold one. Strange, that. Why should it feel wrong? Perhaps I just miss my old Blade." Dalinar dismissed the Blade. "Go," he said, walking back toward his horse, where Highprince Roionlooking stunnedwas watching Amaram stalk away, his personal guard of fifty joining him. * * * Yes, that was Aladar's banner, joining Dalinar's. Sadeas could make it out through the spyglass. He lowered it, and sat quietly for a long, long time. So long that his guards, and even his wife, started to fidget and looked nervous. But there was no reason. He quelled his annoyance. "Let them die out there," he said. "All four. Ialai, make a report for me. I would like to know . . . Ialai?" His wife started, looking toward him. "Is all well?" "I was merely thinking," she said, seeming distant. "About the future. And what it is going to bring. For us." "It is going to bring Alethkar new highprinces," Sadeas said. "Make a report of which among our sworn highlords would be appropriate to take the place of those who will fall on Dalinar's trip." He tossed the spyglass back to the messenger. "We do nothing until they're dead. This will end, it appears, with Dalinar killed by the Parshendi after all. Aladar can go with him, and to Damnation with the lot of them." He turned his horse and continued the day's ride, his back pointedly toward the Shattered Plains. One danger in deploying such a potent weapon will be the potential encouragement of those exploring the Nahel bond. Care must be taken to avoid placing these subjects in situations of powerful stress unless you accept the consequences of their potential Investiture. From the Diagram, Floorboard 27: paragraph 6 Like a river suddenly undammed, the four armies flooded out onto the plateaus. Shallan watched from horseback, excited, anxious. Her little part of the convoy included Vathah and her soldiers, along with Marri, her lady's maid. Gaz, notably, hadn't arrived yet, and Vathah claimed to not know where he was. Perhaps she should have looked more into the nature of his debts. She'd been so busy with other things . . . storms, if the man vanished, how would she feel about that? Adolin trotted up beside her on Sureblood. The beautiful animal was pure whitenot dusty grey, like some horses she'd seen, but actually white. That Adolin should have the larger horse was patently unfair. She was shorter than he was, so she should be on the taller horse. "You purposely gave me a slow one," Shallan complained, "didn't you?" "Sure did." "I'd smack you. If I could reach you up there." He chuckled. "You said you don't have a lot of experience riding, so I picked a horse that had a lot of experience being ridden. Trust me, you'll be thankful." "I want to ride in a majestic charge as we begin our expedition!" "And you can do so." "Slowly." "Technically, slow speeds can be very majestic." "Technically," she said, "a man doesn't need all of his toes. Shall we remove a few of yours and prove it?" He laughed. "As long as you don't hurt my face, I suppose." "Don't be ridiculous. I like your face." He grinned, Shardplate helm hanging from his saddle so as to not mess up his hair. She waited for him to add a quip to hers, but he didn't. That was all right. She liked Adolin as he was. He was kind, noble, and genuine. It didn't matter that he wasn't brilliant or . . . or whatever else Kaladin was. She couldn't even define it. So there. Passionate, with an intense, smoldering resolve. A leashed anger that he used, because he had dominated it. And a certain tempting arrogance. Not the haughty pride of a highlord. Instead, the secure, stable sense of determination that whispered that no matter who you wereor what you didyou could not hurt him. Could not change him. He was. Like the wind and rocks were. Shallan completely missed what Adolin said next. She blushed. "What was that?" "I said that Sebarial has a carriage. You might want to travel with him." "Because I'm too delicate for riding?" Shallan said. "Did you miss that I walked back through the chasms in the middle of a highstorm?" "Um, no. But walking and riding are different. I mean, the soreness . . ." "Soreness?" Shallan asked. "Why would I be sore? Doesn't the horse do all of the work?" Adolin looked at her, eyes widening. "Um," she said. "Dumb question?" "You said you'd ridden before." "Ponies," she said, "on my father's estates. Around in circles . . . All right, from that expression, I'm led to believe I'm being an idiot. When I get sore, I'll go ride with Sebarial." "Before you get sore," Adolin said. "We'll give it an hour." As annoyed as she was at this turn, she couldn't deny his expertise. Jasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired results. She determined to not be bothered, and instead enjoy the ride. The army as a whole moved slowly, considering that each piece seemed to be so efficient. Spearmen in blocks, scribes on horseback, scouts roving outward. Dalinar had six of the massive mechanical bridges, but he had also brought all of the former bridgemen and their simpler, mancarried bridges, designed as copies of the ones they'd left in Sadeas's camp. That was good, since Sebarial only had a couple of bridge crews. She allowed herself a moment of personal satisfaction at the fact that he'd come on the expedition. As she was thinking on that, she noticed someone running up the line of troops behind her. A short man, with an eye patch, who drew glares from Adolin's bridgeman guards for the day. "Gaz?" Shallan said with relief as he hustled up, carrying a package under his arm. Her fears that he'd been knifed in an alley somewhere were unfounded. "Sorry, sorry," he said. "It came. You owe the merchant two sapphire broams, Brightness." "It?" Shallan asked, accepting the package. "Yeah. You asked me to find one for you. I storming did." He seemed proud of himself. She unwrapped the cloth around the rectangular object, and found inside a book. Words of Radiance, the cover said. The sides were worn, and the pages fadedone patch across the top was even stained from spilled ink sometime in the past. Rarely had she been as pleased to receive something so damaged. "Gaz!" she said. "You're wonderful!" He grinned, shooting Vathah a triumphant smile. The taller man rolled his eyes, muttering something Shallan didn't hear. "Thank you," Shallan said. "Thank you truly, Gaz." * * * As the time passed and one day led into another, Shallan found the distraction of the book extremely welcome. The armies moved about as fast as a herd of sleepy chulls, and the scenery was actually quite boring, though she'd never admit that to Kaladin or Adolin, considering what she'd told them last time she was out here. Still, she had learned a great deal. For example, each order had different Ideals, or standards, to determine advancement. Some were specific, others left to the interpretation of the spren. Also, some orders were individualistic, while otherslike the Windrunnersfunctioned in teams, with a specific hierarchy. She settled back, thinking about the powers described. Would the others be appearing, then? As she and Jasnah had? Men who could glide elegantly across the ground as if they weighed nothing, women who could melt stone with a touch. Pattern had offered some few insights, but mostly he had been of use telling her what sounded likely to have been real, and what from the book was a mistake based on hearsay. His memory was spotty, but growing much better, and hearing what the book said often made him remember more. Right now, he buzzed on the seat beside her in a contented way. The carriage hit a bumpit was rough out herebut at least in the coach, she could read and reference other books at the same time. That would have been practically impossible while riding. The coach did make her feel shut away, though. Not everyone who tries to take care of you is trying to do what your father did, she told herself firmly. Adolin's warnedof soreness had never manifested, of course. Originally, she'd felt a small amount of pain in her thighs from holding herself in place in the saddle, but Stormlight had made it vanish. "Mmm," Pattern said, climbing onto the door of the carriage. "It comes." Shallan looked out the window and felt a drop of water sprinkle against her face. Rock darkened as rain coated it. Soon, the air filled with a steady drizzle, light and pleasant. Though colder, it reminded her of some of the rainfalls back in Jah Keved. Here in the stormlands, it seemed that rain was rarely this soft. She pulled down the shades and scooted to the center of the seat so she wouldn't get rained on. She soon found that the pleasing sound of water muffled the soldiers' voices and the monotonous sound of marching feet, making it a nice accompaniment to reading. A quote sparked her interest, and so she dug out her sketch of the Shattered Plains and her old maps of Stormseat. I need to find out how these maps relate, she thought. Multiple points of reference, preferably. If she could identify two places on the Shattered Plains that matched points on her map of Stormseat, she could judge how large Stormseat had beenthe old map had no scaleand then overlay it on the map of the Shattered Plains. That would give them some context. What really drew her attention was the Oathgate. On the map of Stormseat, Jasnah thought it was represented by a round disc, like a dais, on the southwestern side of the city. Was there a doorway there on that dais somewhere? A magical portal to Urithiru? How did one of the knights operate it? "Mmm," Pattern said. Shallan's carriage started to slow. She frowned, scooting to the door, meaning to peek out the window. The door opened, however, to reveal Highlady Navani standing outside, Dalinar himself holding up an umbrella for her. "Would you mind company?" Navani asked. "Not at all, Brightness," Shallan said, scrambling to pick up her papers and books, which she'd spread about on all of the seats. Navani patted Dalinar fondly on the arm, then climbed into the coach, using a towel to dry her feet and legs. She sat once Dalinar shut the door. They started rolling again, and Shallan fidgeted with her papers. What was her relationship with Navani? She was Adolin's aunt, but she was romantically involved with his father. So she was kind of Shallan's future motherinlaw, though by Vorin tradition Dalinar would never be allowed to marry her. Shallan had tried for weeks to get this woman to listen to her, and had failed. Now, she seemed to have been forgiven for bearing the news of Jasnah's death. Did that mean Navani . . . liked her? "So," Shallan said, feeling awkward, "did Dalinar exile you to the coach to protect you from getting sore, as Adolin did to me?" "Sore? Heavens no. If anyone should be riding in the coach, it's Dalinar. When there is fighting to be done, we'll need him rested and ready. I came because it's rather difficult to read while riding in the rain." "Oh." Shallan shifted in her seat. Navani studied her, then finally sighed. "I have been ignoring things," the older woman said, "that I should not. Because they bring me pain." "I am sorry." "You have nothing to apologize for." Navani held out her hand toward Shallan. "May I?" Shallan looked at her handful of notes, diagrams, and maps. She hesitated. "You are engaged in work you obviously think very important," Navani said softly. "This city Jasnah was searching for, according to the notes you sent me? Perhaps I can help you interpret my daughter's intentions." Was there anything in these pages that would incriminate Shallan and reveal her powers? Her activities as Veil? She didn't think so. She'd been studying the Knights Radiant as part of it, but she was searching for their center of power, so that made sense. Hesitant, she handed over the papers. Navani leafed through them, reading by spherelight. "The organization of these notes is . . . interesting." Shallan blushed. The organization made sense to her. As Navani continued to look through the notes, Shallan found herself growing oddly anxious. She'd wanted Navani's helpshe'd all but begged for it. Now, however, she found herself feeling like this woman was intruding. This had become Shallan's project, her duty and her quest. Now that Navani had apparently overcome her grief, would she insist on taking over completely? "You think like an artist," Navani said. "I can see it in the way you put the notes together. Well, I suppose I can't expect everything you do to be annotated precisely as I'd wish. A magical portal to another city? Jasnah actually believed in this?" "Yes." "Hmm," Navani said. "Then it's probably true. That girl never did have the decency to be wrong an appropriate amount of the time." Shallan nodded, glancing at the notes, feeling anxious. "Oh, don't get so touchy," Navani said. "I'm not going to steal the project from you." "I'm that transparent?" Shallan said. "This research is obviously very important to you. I assume Jasnah persuaded you that the fate of the world itself rested upon the answers you find?" "She did." "Damnation," Navani said, flipping to the next page. "I shouldn't have ignored you. It was petty." "It was the act of a grieving mother." "Scholars don't have time for such nonsense." Navani blinked, and Shallan caught a tear in the woman's eye. "You're still human," Shallan said, reaching across, putting her hand on Navani's knee. "We can't all be emotionless chunks of rock like Jasnah." Navani smiled. "She sometimes had the empathy of a corpse, didn't she?" "Comes from being too brilliant," Shallan said. "You grow accustomed to everyone else being something of an idiot, trying to keep up with you." "Chana knows, I wondered sometimes how I raised that child without strangling her. By age six, she was pointing out my logical fallacies as I tried to get her to go to bed on time." Shallan grinned. "I always just assumed she was born in her thirties." "Oh, she was. It just took thirtysome years for her body to catch up." Navani smiled. "I won't take this from you, but neither should I allow you to attempt a project so important on your own. I would be part. Figuring out the puzzles that captivated her . . . it will be like having her again. My little Jasnah, insufferable and wonderful." How surreal it was to imagine Jasnah as a child being held by a mother. "It would be an honor to have your aid, Brightness Navani." Navani held up the page. "You're trying to overlay Stormseat with the Shattered Plains. It's not going to work unless you have a point of reference." "Preferably two," Shallan said. "It's been centuries since that city fell. It was destroyed during Aharietiam itself, I believe. We're going to have trouble finding clues out here, though your list of descriptions will help." She tapped her finger against the papers. "This isn't my area of expertise, but I have several archaeologists among Dalinar's scribes. I should show them these pages." Shallan nodded. "We'll want copies of everything here," Navani said. "I don't want to lose originals to all of this rain. I could have the scribes work on it tonight, after we camp." "If you wish." Navani looked up at her, then frowned. "It is your decision." "You're serious?" Shallan asked. "Absolutely. Think of me as an additional resource." All right then. "Yes, have them make copies," Shallan said, digging in her satchel. "And copies of this tooit's my attempt at recreating one of the murals described as being on the outer wall of the temple to Chanaranach in Stormseat. It faced leeward, and was supposedly shaded, so we might be able to find hints of it. "Also, I need a surveyor to measure each new plateau we cross, once we get farther in. I can draw them out, but my spatial reasoning can be off. I want exact sizes to make the map more accurate. I'll need guards and scribes to ride out with me ahead of the army to visit plateaus parallel to our course. It would really help if you could convince Dalinar to allow this. "I'd like a team to study the quotes on that page underneath the map. They talk about methods for opening the Oathgate, which was supposed to be the duty of the Knights Radiant. Hopefully we can discover another method. Also, alert Dalinar that we'll be trying to open the portal if we find it. I do not expect there to be anything dangerous on the other side, but he'll undoubtedly want to send soldiers through first." Navani raised an eyebrow at her. "You've done a touch of thinking about this, I see." Shallan nodded, blushing. "I'll see it done," Navani said. "I myself will head the research team studying those quotes you mention." She hesitated. "Do you know why Jasnah thought this city, Urithiru, was so important?" "Because it was the seat of the Knights Radiant, and she expected to find information on themand the Voidbringersthere." "So she was like Dalinar," Navani said, "trying to bring back powers that perhapswe should leave alone." Shallan felt a sudden spike of anxiety. I need to say it. Say something. "She wasn't trying. She succeeded." "Succeeded?" Shallan took a deep breath. "I don't know what she said regarding the origin of her Soulcaster, but the truth was that it was a fake. Jasnah could Soulcast on her own, without any fabrial. I saw her do it. She knew secrets from the past, secrets I don't think anyone else knows. Brightness Navani . . . your daughter was one of the Knights Radiant." Or as close to one as the world was going to have again. Navani raised an eyebrow, obviously skeptical. "I swear this is true," Shallan said, "on the tenth name of the Almighty." "That is disturbing. Radiants, Heralds, and Voidbringers alike are supposed to be gone. We won that war." "I know." "I will go get to work on this," Navani said, knocking for the carriage driver to halt the vehicle. * * * The Weeping began. A steady stream of rain. Kaladin could hear it inside his room, like a whisper in the background. Weak, miserable rain, without the fury and passion of a true highstorm. He lay in the darkness, listening to the patter, feeling his leg throb. Wet, cold air leaked into his room, and he dug for the extra blankets that the quartermaster had delivered. He curled up and tried to sleep, but after sleeping most of the day yesterdaythe day that Dalinar's army had lefthe found himself wide awake. He hated being wounded. Bed rest wasn't supposed to happen to him. Not anymore. Syl . . . The Weeping was a bad time for him. Days spent trapped indoors. A perpetual gloom in the sky that seemed to affect him more than it did others, leaving him lethargic and uncaring. A knock came at his door. Kaladin raised his head in the darkness, then sat up and settled himself on his bench of a bed. "Come," he said. The door opened and let in the sound of rain, like a thousand little footsteps scrambling about. Very little light accompanied the sounds. The overcast sky of the Weeping left the land in perpetual twilight. Moash stepped in. He wore his Shardplate, as always. "Storms, Kal. Were you asleep? I'm sorry!" "No, I was awake." "In the darkness?" Kaladin shrugged. Moash clicked the door shut behind him, but took off his gauntlet and hung it from a clip at the waist of his Shardplate. He reached beneath a fold in the metal and pulled out a handful of spheres to light his way. Riches that would have seemed incredible to bridgemen were now pocket change to Moash. "Aren't you supposed to be guarding the king?" Kaladin asked. "On and off," Moash said, sounding eager. "They quartered the five of us guards up by his rooms. In the palace itself! Kaladin, it's perfect." "When?" Kaladin asked softly. "We don't want to ruin Dalinar's expedition," Moash said, "so we're going to wait until he's out there some distance, maybe until he's engaged the enemy. That way, he'll be committed and won't turn back when he gets news. Better for Alethkar if he succeeds at defeating the Parshendi. He will return a hero . . . and a king." Kaladin nodded, feeling sick. "We have everything planned out," Moash said. "We'll raise an alert in the palace that the Assassin in White has been seen. Then we'll do what was done last timesend all of the servants into hiding in their rooms. Nobody will be around to see what we do, nobody will get hurt, and they'll all believe that the Shin assassin was behind this. We couldn't have asked for this to play out better! And you won't have to do anything, Kal. Graves says that we won't need your help after all." "So why are you here?" Kaladin asked. "I just wanted to check on you," Moash said. He stepped in closer. "Is it true, what Lopen says? About your . . . abilities?" Storming Herdazian. Lopen had stayed behindwith Dabbid and Hobberto take care of the barrack and watch over Kaladin. They'd been talking to Moash, it seemed. "Yes," Kaladin said. "What happened?" "I'm not sure," he lied. "I offended Syl. I haven't seen her in days. Without her, I can't draw in Stormlight." "We'll have to fix that somehow," Moash said. "Either that, or get you Plate and Blade of your own." Kaladin looked up at his friend. "I think she left because of the plot to kill the king, Moash. I don't think a Radiant could be involved in something like this." "Shouldn't a Radiant care about doing what is right? Even if it means a difficult decision?" "Sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good," Kaladin said. "Yes, exactly!" "That's what Amaram said. In regards to my friends, whom he murdered to cover up his secrets." "Well, that's different, obviously. He's a lighteyes." Kaladin looked to Moash, whose eyes had turned as light a tan as those of any Brightlord. Same color as Amaram's, actually. "So are you." "Kal," Moash said. "You're worrying me. Don't say things like that." Kaladin looked away. "The king wanted me to deliver a message," Moash said. "That's my excuse for being here. He wants you to come talk to him." "What? Why?" "I don't know. He's been dipping into the wine, now that Dalinar is gone. Not the orange stuff, either. I'll tell him you're too wounded to come." Kaladin nodded. "Kal," Moash said. "We can trust you, right? You're not having second thoughts?" "You said it yourself," Kaladin said. "I don't have to do anything. I just have to stay away." What could I do, anyway? Wounded, with no spren? Everything was in motion. It was too far along for him to stop. "Great," Moash said. "You heal up, all right?" Moash walked out, leaving Kaladin in the darkness again. AhbuttheywereleftbehindItisobviousfromthenatureofthebondButwherewherewhe From the Diagram, Floorboard 17: paragraph 2, every second letter starting with the first In the darkness, Shallan's violet spheres gave life to the rain. Without the spheres, she couldn't see the drops, only hear their deaths upon the stones and the cloth of her pavilion. With the light, each falling speck of water flashed briefly, like starspren. She sat at the edge of the pavilion, as she liked to watch the rainfall between bouts of sketching, while the other scholars sat closer to the center. So did Vathah and a couple of his soldiers, watching over her like nesting skyeels with a single pup. It amused her that they'd grown so protective; they seemed actively proud to be her soldiers. She'd honestly expected them to run off after gaining their clemency. Four days into the Weeping, and she still enjoyed the weather. Why did the soft sound of gentle rain make her feel more imaginative? Around her, creationspren slowly vanished, most having taken the shapes of things about the camp. Swords that sheathed and unsheathed repeatedly, tiny tents that untied and blew in unseen wind. Her picture was of Jasnah as she'd been on that night just over a month ago, when Shallan had last seen her. Leaning upon the desk of a darkened ship's cabin, hand pushing back hair freed from its customary twists and braids. Exhausted, overwhelmed, terrified. The drawing didn't depict a single faithful Memory, not as Shallan usually did them. This was a recreation of what she remembered, an interpretation that was not exact. Shallan was proud of it, as she'd captured Jasnah's contradictions. Contradictions. Those were what made people real. Jasnah exhausted, yet somehow still strongstronger, even, because of the vulnerability she revealed. Jasnah terrified, yet also brave, for one allowed the other to exist. Jasnah overwhelmed, yet powerful. Shallan had recently been trying to do more drawings like thisones synthesized from her own imaginings. Her illusions would suffer if she could only reproduce what she'd experienced. She needed to be able to create, not just copy. The last creationspren faded away, this one imitating a puddle that was being splashed by a boot. Her sheet of paper dimpled as Pattern moved up onto it. He sniffed. "Useless things." "The creationspren?" "They don't do anything. They flit around and watch, admire. Most spren have a purpose. These are merely attracted by someone else's purpose." Shallan sat back, thinking on that, as Jasnah had taught her. Nearby, the scholars and ardents argued about how large Stormseat had been. Navani had done her part wellbetter than Shallan could have hoped. The army's scholars now worked at Shallan's command. Around her in the night, an uncountable array of lights both near and far indicated the breadth of the army. The rain continued to sprinkle down, catching the purple spherelight. She had chosen all spheres of one color. "The artist Eleseth," Shallan observed to Pattern, "once did an experiment. She set out only ruby spheres, in their strength, to light her studio. She wanted to see what effect the allred light would have upon her art." "Mmmm," Pattern said. "To what result?" "At first, during a painting session, the color of light affected her strongly. She would use too little red, and fields of blossoms would look washed out." "Not unexpected." "The interesting thing, however, was what happened if she continued working," Shallan said. "If she painted for hours by that light, the effects diminished. The colors of her reproductions grew more balanced, the pictures of flowers more vivid. She eventually concluded that her mind compensated for the colors she saw. Indeed, if she switched the color of the light during a session, she'd continue for a time to paint as if the room were still red, reacting against the new color." "Mmmmmm . . ." Pattern said, content. "Humans can see the world as it is not. It is why your lies can be so strong. You are able to not admit that they are lies." "It frightens me." "Why? It is wonderful." To him, she was a subject of study. For a moment, she understood how Kaladin must have seen Shallan as she spoke of the chasmfiend. Admiring its beauty, the form of its creation, oblivious to the present reality of its danger. "It frightens me," Shallan said, "because we all see the world by some kind of light personal to us, and that light changes our perception. I don't see clearly. I want to, but I don't know if I ever truly can." Eventually, a pattern broke through the sound of rain, and Dalinar Kholin entered the tent. Straightbacked and greying, he looked more like a general than a king. She had no sketches of him. It seemed a gross omission on her part, so she took a Memory of him walking into the pavilion, an aide holding an umbrella for him. He strode up to Shallan. "Ah, here you are. The one who has taken command of this expedition." Shallan belatedly scrambled to her feet and bowed. "Highprince?" "You have coopted my scribes and cartographers," Dalinar said, sounding amused. "They hum of it like the rainfall. Urithiru. Stormseat. How did you do it?" "I didn't. Brightness Navani did." "She says you convinced her." "I . . ." Shallan blushed. "I was really just there, and she changed her mind . . ." Dalinar nodded curtly to the side, and his aide stepped over to the debating scholars. The aide spoke with them softly, and they rosesome quickly, others with reluctanceand departed into the rain, leaving their papers. The aide followed them, and Vathah looked to Shallan. She nodded, excusing him and the other guards. Soon Shallan and Dalinar were alone in the pavilion. "You told Navani that Jasnah had discovered the secrets of the Knights Radiant," Dalinar said. "I did." "You're certain that Jasnah didn't mislead you somehow," Dalinar said, "or allow you to mislead yourselfthat would be far more like her." "Brightlord, I . . . I don't think that is . . ." She took a breath. "No. She did not mislead me." "How can you be sure?" "I saw it," Shallan said. "I witnessed what she did, and we spoke of it. Jasnah Kholin did not use a Soulcaster. She was one." Dalinar folded his arms, looking past Shallan into the night. "I think I'm supposed to refound the Knights Radiant. The first man I thought I could trust for the job turned out to be a murderer and a liar. Now you tell me that Jasnah might have had actual power. If that is true, then I am a fool." "I don't understand." "In naming Amaram," Dalinar said. "I did what I thought was my task. I wonder now if I was mistaken all along, and that refounding them was never my duty. They might be refounding themselves, and I am an arrogant meddler. You have given me a great deal to think upon. Thank you." He did not smile as he said it; in fact, he looked severely troubled. He turned to leave, clasping his hands behind his back. "Brightlord Dalinar?" Shallan said. "What if your task wasn't to refound the Knights Radiant?" "That is what I just said," Dalinar replied. "What if instead, your task was to gather them?" He looked back to her, waiting. Shallan felt a cold sweat. What was she doing? I have to tell someone sometime, she thought. I can't do as Jasnah did, holding it all. This is too important. Was Dalinar Kholin the right person? Well, she certainly couldn't think of anyone better. Shallan held out her palm, then breathed in, draining one of her spheres. Then she breathed back out, sending a cloud of shimmering Stormlight into the air between herself and Dalinar. She formed it into a small image of Jasnah, the one she'd just drawn, on top of her palm. "Almighty above," Dalinar whispered. A single awespren, like a ring of blue smoke, burst out above him, spreading like the ripple from a stone dropped in a pond. Shallan had seen such a spren only a handful of times in her life. Dalinar stepped closer, reverent, leaning down to inspect Shallan's image. "Can I?" he asked, reaching out a hand. "Yes." He touched the image, causing it to fuzz back into shifting light. When he withdrew his finger, the image reformed. "It's just an illusion," Shallan said. "I can't create anything real." "It's amazing," Dalinar said, his voice so soft she could barely hear it over the pattering rain. "It is wonderful." He looked up at her, and there were shockinglytears in his eyes. "You're one of them." "Maybe, kind of?" Shallan said, feeling awkward. This man, so commanding, so much larger than life, should not be crying in front of her. "I'm not mad," he said, more to himself, it seemed. "I had decided that I wasn't, but that's not the same as knowing. It's all true. They're returning." He tapped at the image again. "Jasnah taught you this?" "I more stumbled into it on my own," Shallan said. "I think I was led to her so she could teach me. We didn't have much time for that, unfortunately." She grimaced, withdrawing the Stormlight, heart beating quickly because of what she'd done. "I need to give you the golden cape," Dalinar said, standing up straight, wiping his eyes and growing firm of voice again. "Put you in charge of them. So we" "Me?" Shallan yelped, thinking of what that would mean to her alternate identity. "No, I can't! I mean, Brightlord, sir, what I can do is mostly useful if nobody knows it's possible. I mean, if everyone is looking for my illusions, I'll never fool them." "Fool them?" Dalinar said. Perhaps the not best choice of words for Dalinar. "Brightlord Dalinar!" Shallan spun, alert, suddenly worried that someone had seen what she did. A lithe messenger approached the tent, dripping wet, locks of hair undone from her braids and sticking to her face. "Brightlord Dalinar! Parshendi spotted, sir!" "Where?" "Eastern side of this plateau," the messenger said, panting. "Scouting party, we think." Dalinar looked from the messenger to Shallan, then cursed and started out into the rain. Shallan tossed her sketchpad onto her chair and followed. "This could be dangerous," Dalinar said. "I appreciate the concern, Brightlord," she said softly. "But I think I could actually take a spear through the stomach, and my abilities would heal me up without a scar. I'm probably the most difficult person to kill in this entire camp." Dalinar strode in silence for a moment. "The fall into the chasm?" he asked softly. "Yes. I think I must have rescued Captain Kaladin too, though I don't know how I managed that." He grunted. They moved quickly through the rain, the water wetting Shallan's hair and clothing. She practically had to jog to keep pace with Dalinar. Storming Alethi and their long legs. Guards ran up, members of Bridge Four, and fell in around them. She heard shouting in the distance. Dalinar sent the guards into a wider perimeter to give himself and Shallan a measure of privacy. "Can you Soulcast?" Dalinar asked softly. "Like Jasnah did?" "Yes," Shallan said. "But I haven't practiced it much." "It could prove very useful." "It's also very dangerous. Jasnah didn't want me practicing without her, though now that she's gone . . . Well, I will do more with it, eventually. Sir, please don't tell anyone about this. For now, at least." "This was why Jasnah took you on as a ward," Dalinar said. "It's why she wanted you marrying Adolin, isn't it? To bind you to us?" "Yes," Shallan said, blushing in the darkness. "A great many things make more sense now. I will tell Navani about you, but nobody else, and I will swear her to secrecy. She can keep a secret, if she has to." She opened her mouth to say yes, but stopped herself. Was that what Jasnah would have said? "We'll send you back to the warcamps," Dalinar continued, eyes forward, speaking softly. "Immediately, with an escort. I don't care how hard you are to kill. You're too valuable to risk on this expedition." "Brightlord," Shallan said, splashing through a pool of water, glad she was wearing boots and leggings under the skirt, "you are not my king, nor are you my highprince. You have no authority over me. My duty is to find Urithiru, so you will not be sending me back. And, by your honor, I will have your promise not to tell a soul what I can do unless I give leave. That includes Brightness Navani." He stopped in place, and stared at her in surprise. Then he grunted, his face barely visible. "I see Jasnah in you." Rarely had Shallan been given such a compliment. Lights bobbed and approached in the rain, soldiers bearing sphere lanterns. Vathah and his men jogged up, having been left behind, and Bridge Four held them back for the moment. "Very well, Brightness," Dalinar said to Shallan. "Your secret will remain one, for now. We will consult further, once this expedition is done. You have read of the things I have been seeing?" She nodded. "The world is about to change," Dalinar said. He took a deep breath. "You give me hope, true hope, that we can change it in the right way." The approaching scouts saluted, and Bridge Four parted to allow their leader access to Dalinar. He was a portly man with a brown hat that reminded her of the one Veil wore, except it was widebrimmed. The scout wore soldier's trousers, but a leather jacket over them, and certainly didn't seem in fighting shape. "Bashin," Dalinar said. "Parshendi on that plateau next to us, sir," Bashin said, pointing. "The Parshendi stumbled over one of my scouting teams. The lads raised the alarm quickly, but we lost all three men." Dalinar cursed softly, then turned toward Highlord Teleb, who had approached from the other direction, wearing his Shardplate, which he'd painted silver. "Wake the army, Teleb. Everyone on alert." "Yes, Brightlord," Teleb said. "Brightlord Dalinar," Bashin said, "the lads took down one of those shellheads before being killed themselves. Sir . . . you need to see this. Something has changed." Shallan shivered, feeling sodden and cold. She'd brought clothing that would last well in the rain, of course, but that didn't mean standing out here was comfortable. Though they wore coats, nobody else seemed to pay much heed. Likely, they took it for granted that during the Weeping, you were going to get soaked. That was something else for which her sheltered childhood had not prepared her. Dalinar did not object as Shallan joined him in walking toward a nearby bridgeone of the more mobile ones run by Kaladin's bridge teams, who wore raincoats and frontbrimmed caps. A group of soldiers on the other side of the bridge dragged something across, pushing a little wave of water before it. A Parshendi corpse. Shallan had only seen the one that she'd found with Kaladin in the chasm. She'd done a sketch of that earlier, and this one looked very different. It had hair well, a kind of hair. Leaning down, she found that it was thicker than human hair, and felt too . . . slick. Was that the right word? The face was marbled, like that of a parshman, this one with prominent red streaks through the black. The body was lean and strong, and something seemed to grow under the skin of the exposed arms, peeking out. Shallan prodded at it, and found it hard and ridged, like a crab shell. In fact, the face was crusted with a kind of thin, bumpy carapace just above the cheeks and running back around the sides of the head. "This isn't a type we've seen before, sir," Bashin said to Dalinar. "Look at those ridges. Sir . . . some of the lads that were killed, they had burn marks on them. In the rain. Shakiest thing I've ever seen . . ." Shallan looked up at them. "What do you mean by a 'type,' Bashin?" "Some Parshendi have hair," the man saidhe was a darkeyes, but clearly well respected, though he didn't bear an obvious military rank. "Others have carapace. The ones we met with King Gavilar long ago, they were . . . shaped different from the ones we fight." "They have specialized subspecies?" Shallan said. Some cremlings were like that, working in a hive, with different specializations and varied forms. "We might be depleting their numbers," Dalinar said to Bashin. "Forcing them to send out their equivalent of lighteyes to fight." "And the burns, Dalinar?" Bashin said, scratching his head under his hat. Shallan reached out to check the Parshendi's eye color. Did they have lighteyes and dark, like humans? She lifted the eyelid. The eye beneath was completely red. She screamed, jumping back, pulling her hand up to her chest. The soldiers cursed, looking around, and Dalinar's Shardblade appeared in his hand a few seconds later. "Red eyes," Shallan whispered. "It's happening." "The red eyes are just a legend." "Jasnah had an entire notebook of references to this, Brightlord," Shallan said, shivering. "The Voidbringers are here. Time is short." "Throw the body into the chasm," Dalinar said to his men. "I doubt we'd be able to easily burn it. Keep everyone alert. Be prepared for an attack tonight. They" "Brightlord!" Shallan spun as a hulking armored figure came up, rainwater trailing down his silvery Plate. "We've found another one, sir," Teleb said. "Dead?" Dalinar said. "No, sir," the Shardbearer said, pointing. "He walked right up to us, sir. He's sitting on a rock over there." Dalinar looked to Shallan, who shrugged. Dalinar started off in the direction Teleb had pointed. "Sir?" Teleb said, voice resonating inside his helm. "Should you . . ." Dalinar ignored the warning, and Shallan hastened after him, collecting Vathah and his two guards. "Should you head back?" Vathah said under his breath to her. Storms, but that face of his looked dangerous in the dim light, even if his voice was respectful. She couldn't help but still see him as the man who had almost killed her, back in the Unclaimed Hills. "I will be safe," Shallan replied softly. "You might have a Blade, Brightness, but you could still die to an arrow in the back." "Unlikely, in this rain," she said. He fell in behind her, offering no further objection. He was trying to do the job she had assigned him. Unfortunately, she was discovering that she didn't much like being guarded. They found the Parshendi after a hike through the rain. The rock he sat on was about as high as a man was tall. He seemed to have no weapons, and about a hundred Alethi soldiers stood around the base of his seat, spears pointed upward. Shallan couldn't make out much more, as he sat across the chasm from them, a portable bridge in place to his plateau. "Has he said anything?" Dalinar asked softly as Teleb stepped up. "Not that I know of," the Shardbearer said. "He just sits there." Shallan peered across the chasm toward the solitary Parshendi man. He stood up, and shaded his eyes against the rain. The soldiers below shuffled, spears rising into more threatening positions. "Skar?" the Parshendi's voice called. "Skar, is that you? And Leyten?" Nearby, one of Dalinar's bridgeman guards cursed. He ran across the bridge, and several other bridgemen followed. They returned a moment later. Shallan crowded in closely to hear what their leader whispered to Dalinar. "It's him, sir," Skar said. "He's changed, but storm me for a fool if I'm wrong it's him. Shen. He ran bridges with us for months, then vanished. Now he's here. He says he wants to surrender to you." Q: For what essential must we strive? A: The essential of preservation, to shelter a seed of humanity through the coming storm. Q: What cost must we bear? A: The cost is irrelevant. Mankind must survive. Our burden is that of the species, and all other considerations are but dust by comparison. From the Diagram, Catechism of the Back of the Flowered Painting: paragraph 1 Dalinar stood with hands behind his back, waiting in his command tent and listening to the patter of rain on the cloth. The floor of the tent was wet. You couldn't avoid that, in the Weeping. He knew that from miserable experience he'd been out on more than one military excursion during this time of year. It was the day after they'd discovered the Parshendi on the Plainsboth the dead one and the one the bridgemen called Shen, or Rlain, as he had said his name was. Dalinar himself had allowed the man to be armed. Shallan claimed that all parshmen were Voidbringers in embryo. He had ample reason to believe her word, considering what she'd shown him. But what was he to do? The Radiants had returned, the Parshendi had manifested red eyes. Dalinar felt as if he were trying to stop a dam from breaking, all the while not knowing where the leaks were actually coming from. The tent flaps parted and Adolin ducked in, escorting Navani. She hung her stormcoat on the rack beside the flap, and Adolin grabbed a towel and began drying his hair and face. Adolin was betrothed to a member of the Knights Radiant. She says she's not one yet, Dalinar reminded himself. That made sense. One could be a trained spearman without being a soldier. One implied skill, the other a position. "They are bringing the Parshendi man?" Dalinar asked. "Yes," Navani said, sitting down in one of the room's chairs. Adolin didn't take his seat, but found a pitcher of filtered rainwater and poured himself a cup. He tapped the side of the tin cup as he drank. They were restless, all of them, following the discovery of redeyed Parshendi. After no attack had come that night, Dalinar had pushed the three armies into another day of marching. Slowly, they approached the middle of the Plains, at least as Shallan's projections indicated. They were already well beyond the regions that scouts had explored. Now, they had to rely on the young woman's maps. The flaps opened again, and Teleb marched in with the prisoner. Dalinar had put the highlord and his personal guard in charge of this "Rlain," as he didn't like how defensive the bridgemen were about him. He did invite their lieutenants Skar and the Horneater cook they called Rockto come to the interrogation, and those two entered after Teleb and his men. General Khal and Renarin were in another tent with Aladar and Roion, going over tactics for when they approached the Parshendi encampment. Navani sat up, leaning forward, narrowing her eyes at the prisoner. Shallan had wanted to attend, but Dalinar had promised to have everything written down for her. The Stormfather had given her some sense, fortunately, and she hadn't insisted. Having too many of them near this spy felt dangerous to Dalinar. He had a vague recollection of the parshman guard who had occasionally joined the men of Bridge Four. Parshmen were practically invisible, but once this one had started carrying a spear, he had become instantly noticeable. Not that there had been anything else distinctive about himsame squat parshman body, marbled skin, dull eyes. This creature before him was nothing like that. He was a full Parshendi warrior, complete with orangered skullplate and armored carapace at the chest, thighs, and outer arms. He was as tall as an Alethi, and more muscular. Though he carried no weapon, the guards still treated him as if he were the most dangerous thing on this plateauand perhaps he was just that. As he stepped up, he saluted Dalinar, hand to chest. Like the other bridgemen. He bore their tattoo on his forehead, reaching up and blending into his skullplate. "Sit," Dalinar ordered, nodding toward a stool at the center of the room. Rlain obeyed. "I'm told," Dalinar said, "that you refuse to tell us anything about the Parshendi plans." "I don't know them," Rlain said. He had the rhythmic intonations common to the Parshendi, but he spoke Alethi very well. Better than any parshman Dalinar had heard. "You were a spy," Dalinar said, hands clasped behind his back, trying to loom over the Parshendibut staying far enough away that the man could not grab him without Adolin getting in the way first. "Yes, sir." "For how long?" "About three years," Rlain said. "In various warcamps." Nearby, Telebfaceplate upturned and raised an eyebrow at Dalinar. "You answer me when I ask," Dalinar said. "But not the others. Why?" "You're my commanding officer," Rlain said. "You're Parshendi." "I . . ." The man looked down at the ground, shoulders bowing. He raised a hand to his head, feeling at the ridge of skin just where his skullplate ended. "Something is very wrong, sir. Eshonai's voice . . . on the plateau that day, when she came to meet with Prince Adolin . . ." "Eshonai," Dalinar prompted. "The Parshendi Shardbearer?" Nearby, Navani scribbled on a pad of paper, writing down each word spoken. "Yes. She was my commander. But now . . ." He looked up, and despite the alien skin and the strange way of speaking, Dalinar recognized grief in this man's face. Terrible grief. "Sir, I have reason to believe that everyone I know . . . everyone I loved . . . has been destroyed, monsters left in their place. The listeners, the Parshendi, may be no more. I have nothing left . . ." "Yes you do," Skar said from outside the ring of guards. "You're Bridge Four." Rlain looked at him. "I'm a traitor." "Ha!" Rock said. "Is little problem. Can be fixed." Dalinar gestured to quiet the bridgemen. He glanced at Navani, who nodded for him to continue. "Tell me," Dalinar said, "how you hid among the parshmen." "I . . ." "Soldier," Dalinar barked. "That was an order." Rlain sat up. Amazingly, he seemed to want to obeyas if he needed something to lend him strength. "Sir," Rlain said, "it's just something my people can do. We choose a form based on what we need, the job required of us. Dullform, one of those forms, looks a lot like a parshman. Hiding among them is easy." "We account our parshmen with precision," Navani said. "Yes," Rlain replied, "and we are noticedbut rarely questioned. Who questions when you find an extra sphere lying on the ground? It's not something suspicious. It's merely fortune." Dangerous territory, Dalinar thought, noticing the change in Rlain's voice the beat to which he was speaking. This man did not like how the parshmen were treated. "You spoke of the Parshendi," Dalinar said. "This has to do with the red eyes?" Rlain nodded. "What does it mean, soldier?" Dalinar asked. "It means our gods have returned," Rlain whispered. "Who are your gods?" "They are the souls of those ancient. Those who gave of themselves to destroy." A different rhythm to his words this time, slow and reverent. He looked up at Dalinar. "They hate you and your kind, sir. This new form they have given my people . . . it is something terrible. It will bring something terrible." "Can you lead us to the Parshendi city?" Dalinar asked. Rlain's voice changed again. A different rhythm. "My people . . ." "You said they are gone," Dalinar said. "They might be," Rlain said. "I got close enough to see an army, tens of thousands. But surely they left some in other forms. The elderly? The young? Who watches our children?" Dalinar stepped up to Rlain, waving back Adolin, who raised an anxious hand. He stooped down, laying an arm on the Parshendi man's shoulder. "Soldier," Dalinar said, "if what you're telling me is correct, then the most important thing you can do is lead us to your people. I will see that the noncombatants are protected, my word of honor on it. If something terrible is happening to your people, you need to help me stop it." "I . . ." Rlain took a deep breath. "Yes, sir," he said to a different rhythm. "Meet with Shallan Davar," Dalinar said. "Describe the route to her, and get us a map. Teleb, you may release the prisoner into the custody of Bridge Four." The Oldblood Shardbearer nodded. As the group of them left, letting in a gust of rainy wind, Dalinar sighed and sat down beside Navani. "You trust his word?" "I don't know," Dalinar said. "But something did shake that man, Navani. Soundly." "He's Parshendi," she said. "You may be misreading his body language." Dalinar leaned forward, clasping his hands before him. "The countdown?" he asked. "Three days away," Navani said. "Three days before Lightday." So little time. "We hasten our pace," he said. Inward. Toward the center. And destiny. You must become king. Of Everything. From the Diagram, Tenets of Instruction, Back of the Footboard: paragraph 1 Shallan fought against the wind, pulling her stormcoatstolen from a soldier close around her as she struggled up the slick incline. "Brightness?" Gaz asked. He grabbed his cap to keep it from blowing free. "Are you certain you want to do this?" "Of course I am," Shallan said. "Whether or not what I'm doing is wise . . . well, that's another story." These winds were unusual for the Weeping, which was supposed to be a period of placid rainfall, a time for contemplating the Almighty, a respite from highstorms. Maybe things were different out here in the stormlands. She pulled herself up the rocks. The Shattered Plains had grown increasingly rough as the armies traveled inwardnow on their eighth day of the expeditionfollowing Shallan's map, created with the help of Rlain, the former bridgeman. Shallan crested the rock formation and found the view that the scouts had described. Vathah and Gaz stomped up behind her, muttering about the cold. The heart of the Shattered Plains extended before Shallan. The inner plateaus, never explored by men. "It's here," she said. Gaz scratched at the socket beneath his eye patch. "Rocks?" "Yes, guardsman Gaz," Shallan said. "Rocks. Beautiful, wonderful rocks." In the distance, she saw shadows draped in a veil of misty rain. Seen together in a group like this, it was unmistakable. This was a city. A city covered over with centuries' worth of crem, like children's blocks dribbled with many coats of melted wax. To the innocent eye, it undoubtedly looked much like the rest of the Shattered Plains. But it was oh so much more. It was proof. Even this formation Shallan stood upon had probably once been a building. Weathered on the stormward side, dribbled with crem down the leeward side to create the bulbous, uneven slope they had climbed. "Brightness!" She ignored the voices from down below, instead waving impatiently for the spyglass. Gaz handed it to her, and she raised it to inspect the plateaus ahead. Unfortunately, the thing had fogged up on one end. She tried to rub it clean, rain washing over her, but the fog was on the inside. Blasted device. "Brightness?" Gaz asked. "Shouldn't we, uh, listen to what they're saying down below?" "More twisted Parshendi spotted," Shallan said, raising the spyglass again. Wouldn't the designer of the thing have built it to be sealed on the inside, to prevent moisture from getting in? Gaz and Vathah stepped back as several members of Bridge Four reached the top of the incline. "Brightness," one of the bridgemen said, "Highprince Dalinar has withdrawn the vanguard and ordered a secure perimeter on the plateau behind us." He was a tall, handsome man whose arms seemed entirely too long for his body. Shallan looked with dissatisfaction at the inner plateaus. "Brightness," the bridgeman continued reluctantly, "he did say that if you wouldn't come, he would send Adolin to . . . um . . . cart you back over his shoulder." "I would like to see him do that," Shallan said. It did sound kind of romantic, the sort of thing you'd read of in a novel. "He's that worried about the Parshendi?" "Shen . . . er, Rlain . . . says we're practically to their home plateau, Brightness. Too many of their patrols have been spotted. Please." "We need to get in there," Shallan said, pointing. "That's where the secrets are." "Brightness . . ." "Very well," she said, turning and hiking down the incline. She slipped, which did not help her dignity, but Vathah caught her arm before she tumbled onto her face. Once down, they quickly crossed this smaller plateau, joining scouts who were jogging back toward the bulk of the army. Rlain claimed to know nothing himself of the Oathgateor even really much about the city, which he called "Narak" instead of Stormseat. He said his people had only taken up permanent residence here following the Alethi invasion. During the push inward, Dalinar's soldiers had spotted an increasing number of Parshendi and had clashed with them in brief skirmishes. General Khal thought that the forays had been intended to draw the army off course, though how they would figure that, Shallan didn't knowbut she did know she was growing tired of feeling damp all the time. They had been out here nearly two weeks now, and some of the soldiers had begun to mutter that the army would need to return to the warcamps soon, or risk not getting back before the highstorms resumed. Shallan stalked across the bridge and passed several lines of spearmen setting up behind short, wavelike ridges in the stonelikely the footings of old walls. She found Dalinar and the other highprinces in a tent set up at the center of camp. It was one of six identical tents, and it wasn't immediately obvious which one held the four highprinces. A safety precaution of some sort, she assumed. As Shallan stepped in out of the rain, she intruded upon their conversation. "The current plateau does have very favorable defensible positions," Aladar said, gesturing toward a map set out on the travel table before them. "I prefer our chances against an assault here to moving deeper." "And if we move deeper," Dalinar said with a grunt, "we'll be in danger of getting split during an attack, half on one plateau, half on the other." "But do they even need to attack?" Roion said. "If I were them, I'd just form up out there as if to prepare for an attackbut then I wouldn't. I'd stall, forcing my enemy to get stuck out here waiting for an attack until the highstorms returned!" "He makes a valid point," Aladar admitted. "Trust a coward," Sebarial said, "to know the smartest way to stay out of fighting." He sat with Palona beside the table, eating fruit and smiling pleasantly. "I am not a coward," Roion said, forming fists at his sides. "I didn't mean it as an insult," Sebarial said. "My insults are far more pithy. That was a compliment. If I had my way, I'd hire you to run all wars, Roion. I suspect there would be far fewer casualties, and the price of undergarments would double once soldiers were told that you were in charge. I'd make a fortune." Shallan handed her dripping coat to a servant, then took off her cap and began drying her hair with a towel. "We need to press closer to the center of the Plains," she said. "Roion is right. I refuse to let us bivouac. The Parshendi will just wait us out." The others looked to her. "I wasn't aware," Dalinar said, "that you decided our tactics, Brightness Shallan." "It's our own fault, Dalinar," Sebarial said, "for giving her so much leeway. We probably should have tossed her off the Pinnacle weeks ago, the moment she arrived at that meeting." Shallan was stirring up a retort as the tent flaps parted and Adolin trudged in, Shardplate streaming. He pushed up his faceplate. Storms . . . he looked so good, even when you could see only half his face. She smiled. "They are definitely agitated," Adolin said. He saw her, and gave her a quick smile before clinking up to the table. "There are at least ten thousand of those twisted Parshendi out there, moving in groups around the plateaus." "Ten thousand," Aladar said with a grunt. "We can take ten thousand. Even with them having the terrain advantage, even if we have to assault rather than defend, we should handle that many with ease. We have over thirty thousand." "This is what we came to do," Dalinar said. He looked at Shallan, who blushed at her forwardness earlier. "Your portal, the one you think is out here. Where would it be?" "Closer to the city," Shallan said. "What of those red eyes?" Roion asked. He looked very uncomfortable. "And the flashes of light they cause when they fight? Storms, when I spoke earlier, I didn't mean that I wanted us to go farther. I was just worried at what the Parshendi would do. I . . . there's no easy way to do this, is there?" "So far as Rlain has said," Navani said from her seated position at the side of the room, "only their soldiers can jump between plateaus, but we can assume the new form capable of it as well. They can flee us if we push forward." Dalinar shook his head. "They set up on the Plains, rather than fleeing all those years ago, because they knew it was their best chance for survival. On the open, unbroken rock of the stormlands, they could be hunted and destroyed. Out here they have the advantage. They won't abandon it now. Not if they think they can fight us." "If we want to make them fight, then," Aladar said, "we need to threaten their homes. I guess we really should press toward the city." Shallan relaxed. Each step closer to the centerby Rlain's explanations, they were but half a day awaygot her closer to the Oathgate. Dalinar leaned forward, spreading his hands to the sides, his shadow falling on the battle maps. "Very well. I did not come all this way to timidly wait upon Parshendi whims. We'll march inward tomorrow, threaten their city, and force them to engage." "The closer we get," Sebarial noted, "the more likely we are to become cut off without hope of retreat." Dalinar didn't respond, but Shallan knew what he was thinking. We gave up hope of retreat days ago. A flight across days and days of plateaus would be a disaster if the Parshendi decided to harry. The Alethi fought here, and they won, seizing the shelter of Narak. That was their only option. Dalinar adjourned the meeting, and the highprinces left, surrounded by groups of aides holding umbrellas. Shallan waited as Dalinar caught her eyes. In moments only she, Dalinar, Adolin, and Navani remained. Navani walked up to Dalinar, taking his arm with both of hers. An intimate posture. "This portal of yours," Dalinar said. "Yes?" Shallan asked. Dalinar looked up and met her eyes. "How real is it?" "Jasnah was convinced it was completely real. She was never wrong." "This would be a storming bad time for her to break her record," he said softly. "I agreed to press forward, in part, because of your exploration." "Thank you." "I did not do it for scholarship," Dalinar said. "From what Navani tells me, this portal offers a unique opportunity for retreat. I had hoped to defeat the Parshendi before danger overtook us, whatever it was. Judging by what we've seen, danger has arrived early." Shallan nodded. "Tomorrow is the last day of the countdown," Dalinar said. "Scribbled on the walls during highstorms. Whatever it is, whatever it was, we meet it tomorrow and you are my backup plan, Shallan Davar. You will find this portal, and you will make it work. If the evil overwhelms us, your pathway will be our escape. You may be the only chance that our armiesand indeed, Alethkar itselfhave for survival." * * * Days passed, and Kaladin refused to let the rain overcome him. He limped through the camp, using a crutch that Lopen had fetched for him despite objecting that it was too soon for Kaladin to be up and about. The place was still empty, save for the occasional parshmen lugging wood from the forests outside or carrying sacks of grain. The camp didn't get any news about the expedition. The king was probably being sent word via spanreed, but he didn't share it with everyone else. Storms, this place feels eerie, Kaladin thought, limping past deserted barracks, rain pattering against the umbrella that Lopen had tied to Kaladin's crutch. It worked. Kind of. He passed rainspren, like blue candles sprouting from the ground, each with a single eye in the center of its top. Creepy things. Kaladin had always disliked them. He fought the rain. Did that make any sense? It seemed that the rain wanted him to stay inside, so he went out. The rain wanted him to give in to the despair, so he forced himself to think. Growing up, he'd had Tien to help lighten the gloom. Now, even thinking of Tien increased that gloom insteadthough he couldn't avoid it. The Weeping reminded him of his brother. Of laughter when the darkness threatened, of cheerful joy and carefree optimism. Those images warred with ones of Tien's death. Kaladin squeezed his eyes shut, trying to banish that memory. Of the frail young man, barely trained, being cut down. Tien's own company of soldiers had put him at the front as a distraction, a sacrifice to slow the enemy. Kaladin set his jaw, opening his eyes. No more moping. He would not whine or wallow. Yes, he'd lost Syl. He'd lost many loved ones during his life. He would survive this agony as he had survived the others. He continued his limping circuit of the barracks. He did this four times a day. Sometimes Lopen came with him, but today Kaladin was alone. He splashed through puddles of water, and found himself smiling because he wore the boots Shallan had stolen from him. I never did believe she was a Horneater, he thought. I need to make sure she knows that. He stopped, leaning on the crutch and looking out through the rain toward the Shattered Plains. He couldn't see far. The haze of rainfall prevented that. You come back safely, he thought to those out there. All of you. This time, I can't help you if something goes wrong. Rock, Teft, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, everyone in Bridge Fourall out on their own. How different a place would the world be if Kaladin had been a better man? If he'd used his powers and had returned to the warcamp with Shallan full of Stormlight? He had been so close to revealing what he could do . . . You'd been thinking that for weeks, he thought to himself. You'd never have done it. You were too scared. He hated admitting it, but it was true. Well, if his suspicions about Shallan were true, perhaps Dalinar would have his Radiant anyway. May she make a better run of it than Kaladin had. He continued on his limping way, rounding back to Bridge Four's barrack. He stopped when he saw a fine carriage, pulled by horses bearing the king's livery, waiting in front of it. Kaladin cursed, hobbling forward. Lopen ran out to meet him, not carrying an umbrella. A lot of people gave up on trying to stay dry during the Weeping. "Lopen!" Kaladin said. "What?" "He's waiting for you, gancho," Lopen said, gesturing urgently. "The king himself." Kaladin limped more quickly toward his room. The door was open, and Kaladin peeked in to find King Elhokar standing inside, looking about the small chamber. Moash guarded the door, and Takaa former member of the King's Guardstood nearer to the king. "Your Majesty?" Kaladin asked. "Ah," the king said, "bridgeman." Elhokar's cheeks were flushed. He'd been drinking, though he didn't appear drunk. Kaladin understood. With Dalinar and that disapproving glare of his gone for a time, it was probably nice to relax with a bottle. When Kaladin had first met the king, he'd thought Elhokar lacked regality. Now, oddly, he thought Elhokar did look like a king. It wasn't that the king had changedthe man still had his imperious features, with that overly large nose and condescending manner. The change was in Kaladin. The things he'd once associated with kingshiphonor, strength of arms, nobilityhad been replaced with Elhokar's less inspiring attributes. "This is really all that Dalinar assigns one of his officers?" Elhokar asked, gesturing around the room. "That man. He expects everyone to live with his own austerity. It is as if he's completely forgotten how to enjoy himself." Kaladin looked to Moash, who shrugged, Shardplate clinking. The king cleared his throat. "I was told you were too weak to make the trip to see me. I see that might not be the case." "I'm sorry, Your Majesty," Kaladin said. "I'm not well, but I walk the camp each day to rebuild my strength. I feared that my weakness and appearance might be offensive to the Throne." "You've learned to speak politically, I see," the king said, folding his arms. "The truth is that my command is meaningless, even to a darkeyes. I no longer have authority in the eyes of men." Great. Here we go again. The king waved curtly. "Out, you other two. I'd speak to this man alone." Moash glanced at Kaladin, looking concerned, but Kaladin nodded. With reluctance, Moash and Taka walked out, shutting the door, leaving them to the light of a few dwindling spheres that the king set out. Soon, those wouldn't have any Stormlight to them at allit had been too long without a highstorm. They'd need to break out candles and oil lamps. "How did you know," the king asked him, "how to be a hero?" "Your Majesty?" Kaladin asked, sagging against his crutch. "A hero," the king said, waving flippantly. "Everyone loves you, bridgeman. You saved Dalinar, you fought Shardbearers, you came back after falling into the storming chasms! How do you do it? How do you know?" "It's really just luck, Your Majesty." "No, no," the king said. He began pacing. "It's a pattern, though I can't figure it out. When I try to be strong, I make a fool of myself. When I try to be merciful, people walk all over me. When I try to listen to counsel, it turns out I've picked the wrong men! When I try to do everything on my own, Dalinar has to take over lest I ruin the kingdom. "How do people know what to do? Why don't I know what to do? I was born to this office, given the throne by the Almighty himself! Why would he give me the title, but not the capacity? It defies reason. And yet, everyone seems to know things that I do not. My father could rule even the likes of Sadeasmen loved Gavilar, feared him, and served him all at once. I can't even get a darkeyes to obey a command to come visit the palace! Why doesn't this work? What do I have to do?" Kaladin stepped back, shocked at the frankness. "Why are you asking me this, Your Majesty?" "Because you know the secret," the king said, still pacing. "I've seen how your men regard you; I've heard how people speak of you. You're a hero, bridgeman." He stopped, then walked up to Kaladin, taking him by the arms. "Can you teach me?" Kaladin regarded him, baffled. "I want to be a king like my father was," Elhokar said. "I want to lead men, and I want them to respect me." "I don't . . ." Kaladin swallowed. "I don't know if that's possible, Your Majesty." Elhokar narrowed his eyes at Kaladin. "So you do still speak your mind. Even after the trouble it brought you. Tell me. Do you think me a bad king, bridgeman?" "Yes." The king drew in a sharp breath, still holding Kaladin by the arms. I could do it right here, Kaladin realized. Strike the king down. Put Dalinar on the throne. No hiding, no secrets, no cowardly assassination. A fight, him and me. That seemed a more honest way to be about it. Sure, Kaladin would probably be executed, but he found that didn't bother him. Should he do it, for the good of the kingdom? He could imagine Dalinar's anger. Dalinar's disappointment. Death didn't bother Kaladin, but failing Dalinar . . . Storms. The king let go and stalked away. "Well, I did ask," he muttered to himself. "I merely have to win you over as well. I will figure this out. I will be a king to be remembered." "Or you could do what is best for Alethkar," Kaladin said, "and step down." The king stopped in place. He turned on Kaladin, expression darkening. "Do not overstep yourself, bridgeman. Bah. I should never have come here." "I agree," Kaladin said. He found this entire experience surreal. Elhokar made to leave. He stopped at the door, not looking at Kaladin. "When you came, the shadows went away." "The . . . shadows?" "I saw them in mirrors, in the corners of my eyes. I could swear I even heard them whispering, but you frightened them. I haven't seen them since. There's something about you. Don't try to deny it." The king looked to him. "I am sorry for what I did to you. I watched you fight to help Adolin, and then I saw you defend Renarin . . . and I grew jealous. There you were, such a champion, so loved. And everyone hates me. I should have gone to fight myself. "Instead, I overreacted to your challenge of Amaram. You weren't the one who ruined our chance against Sadeas. It was me. Dalinar was right. Again. I'm so tired of him being right, and me being wrong. In light of that, I am not at all surprised that you find me a bad king." Elhokar pushed open the door and left. The Unmade are a deviation, a flair, a conundrum that may not be worth your time. You cannot help but think of them. They are fascinating. Many are mindless. Like the spren of human emotions, only much more nasty. I do believe a few can think, however. From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk Drawer: paragraph 14 Dalinar strode from the tent into a subtle rain, joined by Navani and Shallan. The rain sounded softer out here than it had inside the tent, where the drops had drummed upon the fabric. They had marched farther inward all that morning, bringing them to the very heart of the ruined plateaus. They were close now. So close, they had the Parshendi's full attention. It was happening. An attendant offered an umbrella to each person leaving the tent, but Dalinar waved his away. If his men had to stand in this, he'd join them. He'd be soaked by the end of this day anyway. He strode through the ranks, following bridgemen in stormcoats who led the way with sapphire lanterns. It was still day, but the thick cloud cover rendered everything dim. He used blue light to identify himself. Roion and Aladar, seeing that Dalinar had eschewed an umbrella, stepped out into the rain with him. Sebarial, of course, stayed underneath his. They reached the edge of the mass of troops who had formed up in a large oval, facing outward. He knew his soldiers well enough to sense their anxiety. They stood too stiffly, with no shuffling or stretching. They were also silent, not chattering to distract themselvesnot even griping. The only voices he heard were occasional barked orders as officers trimmed the lines. Dalinar soon saw what was causing the uneasiness. Glowing red eyes amassed on the next plateau. They hadn't glowed before. Red eyes yes, but not with those uncanny glows. In the dim light, the Parshendi bodies were indistinct, no more than shadows. The crimson eyes hovered like Taln's Scarlike spheres in the darkness, deeper in color than any ruby. Parshendi beards often bore bits of gemstone woven into them in patterns, but today those didn't glow. Too long without a highstorm, Dalinar thought. Even the gems in Alethi spherescut with facets and so able to hold light longerhad almost all failed by this point of the Weeping, though larger gemstones might last another week or so. They had entered the darkest part of the year. The time when Stormlight did not shine. "Oh, Almighty!" Roion whispered, looking at those red eyes. "Oh, by the names of God himself. What have you brought us to, Dalinar?" "Can you do anything to help?" Dalinar asked softly, looking to Shallan, who stood beneath her umbrella at his side, her guards just behind. Face pale, she shook her head. "I'm sorry." "The Knights Radiant were warriors," Dalinar said, very softly. "If they were, then I've got a long way to go. . . ." "Go, then," Dalinar told the girl. "When there is an opening in the fighting, find that pathway to Urithiru, if it exists. You're my only contingency plan, Brightness." She nodded. "Dalinar," Aladar said, sounding horrified as he watched the red eyes, which were forming into ordered ranks on the other side of the chasm, "tell me straight. When you brought us on this march, did you expect to find these horrors?" "Yes." It was true enough. He didn't know what horrors he'd find, but he had known that something was coming. "You came anyway?" Aladar demanded. "You hauled us all the way out onto these cursed plains, you let us be surrounded by monsters, to be slaughtered and " Dalinar grabbed Aladar by the front of the jacket and hauled him forward. The move caught the other man completely off guard, and he quieted, eyes widening. "Those are Voidbringers out there," Dalinar hissed, rain dribbling down his face. "They've returned. Yes, it is true. And we, Aladar, we have a chance to stop them. I don't know if we can prevent another Desolation, but I'd do anything including sacrificing myself and this entire armyto protect Alethkar from those things. Do you understand?" Aladar nodded, wideeyed. "I hoped to get here before this happened," Dalinar said, "but I didn't. So now we're going to fight. And storm it, we're going to destroy those things. We're going to stop them, and we're going to hope that will stop this evil from spreading to the world's parshmen, as my niece feared. If you survive this day, you'll be known as one of the greatest men of our generation." He released Aladar, letting the highprince stumble back. "Go to your men, Aladar. Go lead them. Be a champion." Aladar stared at Dalinar, mouth gaping. Then, he straightened. He slapped his arm to his chest, giving a salute as crisp as any Dalinar had seen. "It will be done, Brightlord," Aladar said. "Highprince of War." Aladar barked to his attendantsincluding Mintez, the highlord that Aladar usually had use his Shardplate in battlethen put his hand to his sidesword and dashed away in the rain. "Huh," Sebarial said from beneath his umbrella. "He's actually buying into it. He thinks he's going to be a storming hero." "He now knows I was right about the need to unify Alethkar. He's a good soldier. Most of the highprinces are . . . or were, at some point." "Pity you ended up with us two instead of them," Sebarial said, nodding toward Roion, who still stared out at the shifting red eyes. There were thousands now, still increasing as more Parshendi arrived. Scouts reported that they were gathering on all three plateaus bordering the large one that the Alethi occupied. "I'm useless in a battle," Sebarial continued, "and Roion's archers will be wasted in this rain. Besides, he's a coward." "Roion is not a coward," Dalinar said, laying a hand on the shorter highprince's arm. "He's careful. That did not serve him well in the squabbling over gemhearts, where men like Sadeas threw away lives in exchange for prestige. But out here, care is an attribute I'd choose over recklessness." Roion turned to Dalinar, blinking away water. "Is this really happening?" "Yes," Dalinar said. "I want you with your men, Roion. They need to see you. This is going to terrify them, but not you. You're careful, in control." "Yeah," Roion said. "Yes. You . . . you're going to get us out of this, right?" "No, I'm not," Dalinar said. Roion frowned. "We're all going to get ourselves out of it together." Roion nodded, and didn't object. He saluted as Aladar had, if less crisply, then headed toward his army on the northern flank, calling for his aides to give him the numbers of his reserves. "Damnation," Sebarial said, watching Roion go. "Damnation. What about me? Where's my impassioned speech?" "You," Dalinar said, "are to go back to the command tent and not get in the way." Sebarial laughed. "All right. That I can do." "I want Teleb in command of your army," Dalinar said. "And I'm sending both Serugiadis and Rust to join him. Your men will fight better against these things with a few Shardbearers at their head." All three were men who had been given Shards following Adolin's dueling spree. "I'll give the order that Teleb is to be obeyed." "And Sebarial?" Dalinar asked. "Yes?" "If you have a mind for it, burn some prayers. I don't know if anyone up there is listening anymore, but it can't hurt." Dalinar turned toward the sea of red eyes. Why were they just standing there watching? Sebarial hesitated. "Not as confident as you acted to the other two, eh?" He smiled, as if that comforted him, then sauntered off. What a strange man. Dalinar nodded to one of his aides, who went to give the orders to the three Kholin Shardbearers, first picking Serugiadisa lanky young man whose sister Adolin had once courtedout of his command post along the ranks, then running off to fetch Teleb and explain Dalinar's orders. That seen to, Dalinar stepped up to Navani. "I need to know you're safe in the command tent. As safe as anyone can be." "Then pretend I'm there," she said. "But" "You want my help with fabrials?" Navani said. "I can't set up that sort of thing remotely, Dalinar." He ground his teeth, but what could he say? He was going to need every edge he could get. He looked out at the red eyes again. "Campfire tales come alive," said Rock, the massive Horneater bridgeman. Dalinar had never seen that one guarding him or his sons; he was a quartermaster, Dalinar believed. "These things should not be. Why do they not move?" "I don't know," Dalinar said. "Send a few of your men to fetch Rlain. I want to see if he can provide any explanations." As two bridgemen ran off, Dalinar turned to Navani. "Gather your scribes to write my words. I will speak to the soldiers." Within moments, she had a pair of scribesshivering as they stood under umbrellas with pencils out to writeready to record his words. They'd send women down the lines and read his message to all the men. Dalinar climbed into Gallant's saddle to get a little height. He turned toward the ranks of men nearby. "Yes," he shouted over the sound of the rain, "these are Voidbringers. Yes, we're going to fight them. I don't know what they can do. I don't know why they've returned. But we came here to stop them. "I know you're scared, but you have heard of my visions in the highstorms. In the warcamps, the lighteyes mocked me and dismissed what I'd seen as delusions." He thrust his arm to the side, pointing at the sea of red eyes. "Well out there, you see proof that my visions were true! Out there, you see what I have been told would come!" Dalinar licked wet lips. He had given many battlefield speeches in his life, but never had he said anything like what came to him now. "I," he shouted, "have been sent by the Almighty himself to save this land from another Desolation. I have seen what those things can do; I have lived lives broken by the Voidbringers. I've seen kingdoms shattered, peoples ruined, technology forgotten. I've seen civilization itself brought to the trembling edge of collapse. "We will prevent this! Today you fight not for the wealth of a lighteyes, or even for the honor of your king. Today, you fight for the good of all men. You will not fight alone! Trust in what I have seen, trust in my words. If those things have returned, then so must the forces that once defeated them. We will see miracles before this day is out, men! We merely have to be strong enough to deserve them." He looked across a sea of hopeful eyes. Storms. Were those gloryspren about his head, spinning like golden spheres in the rain? His scribes finished writing down the short speech, then hurriedly started making copies to send with runners. Dalinar watched them go, hoping to the Tranquiline Halls that he hadn't just lied to everyone. His force seemed small in this darkness, surrounded by enemies. Soon, he heard his own words being spoken in the distance, read out to the troops. Dalinar remained seated, Shallan beside his horse, though Navani moved off to see to several of her contraptions. The battle plan called for them to wait a little longer, and Dalinar was content to do so. With these chasms to cross, it was far better to be assaulted than to assault. Perhaps the separate armies forming up would encourage the Parshendi to start the battle by coming to him. Fortunately, the rain meant no arrows. The bowstrings wouldn't stand the dampness, nor would the animal glue in the Parshendi recurve bows. The Parshendi started singing. It came in a sudden roar over the rains, startling his men, making them shy backward in a wave. The song wasn't one Dalinar had ever heard during plateau runs. This was more staccato, more frenetic. It rose all around, coming from the three surrounding plateaus, shouted like thrown axes at the Alethi in the center. Dalinar shivered. Wind blew against him, stronger than was normal during the Weeping. The gust drove raindrops against the side of his face. Cold bit his skin. "Brightlord!" Dalinar turned in his saddle, noting four bridgemen approaching along with Rlainhe still had the man under guard at all times. He waved for his guards to part, allowing the Parshendi bridgeman to scramble up to his horse. "That song!" Rlain said. "That song." "What is it, man?" "It is death," Rlain whispered. "Brightlord, I have never heard it before, but the rhythm is one of destruction. Of power." Across the chasm, the Parshendi started to glow. Tiny lines of red sparked around their arms, blinking and shaking, like lightning. "What is that?" Shallan asked. Dalinar narrowed his eyes, and another burst of wind washed over him. "You have to stop it," Rlain said. "Please. Even if you have to kill them. Do not let them finish that song." It was the day of the countdown he had scribbled on the walls without knowing. The last day. Dalinar made his decision based on instinct. He called for a messenger, and one jogged upTeshav's ward, a girl in her fifteenth year. "Pass the word," he commanded her. "Send to General Khal at the command tent, the battalionlords, my son, Teleb, and the other highprinces. We're changing strategies." "Brightlord?" the messenger asked. "What change?" "We attack. Now!" * * * Kaladin stopped at the entrance to the lighteyed training grounds, rainwater streaming off his umbrella's waxed cloth, surprised at what he saw. In preparation for a storm, the ardents normally swept and shoveled the sand into covered trenches at the edges of the ground to keep it from being blown away. He had expected to see something similar during the Weeping. Instead, they had left the sand out, but had then placed a short wooden barrier across the gateway in. It plugged the front of the sparring grounds, allowing them to fill up with water. A small cascade of rainwater poured over the lip of the barrier and into the roadway. Kaladin regarded the small lake that now filled the courtyard, then sighed and reached down, undoing his laces, then pulling off both boots and socks. When he stepped in, the cold water came up to his calves. Soft sand squished between his toes. What was the purpose of this? He crossed the courtyard, crutch under his arm, boots joined by the laces and slung over his shoulder. The chill water numbed his wounded foot, which actually felt nice, though his leg still hurt with each step. It seemed that the two weeks of healing hadn't done much for his wounds. His continued insistence that he walk so much probably wasn't helping. He'd been spoiled by his abilities; a soldier with such a wound normally would take months to recover. Without Stormlight, he'd just have to be patient and heal like everyone else. He had expected to find the training grounds as abandoned as most of the camp. Even the markets were relatively empty, people preferring to remain indoors during the Weeping. Here, however, he found the ardents laughing and chatting as they sat in chairs in the raised arcades framing the sparring grounds. They sewed leather practice jerkins, cups of auburn wine on tables at their sides. That area rose enough above the yard floor to stay dry. Kaladin walked along, searching among them, but didn't find Zahel. He even peeked in the man's room, but it was empty. "Up above, bridgeman!" one of the ardents called. The bald woman pointed toward the stairwell at the corner, where Kaladin had often sent guards to secure the roof when Adolin and Renarin practiced. Kaladin waved in thanks, then hobbled over and awkwardly made his way up the steps. He had to close his umbrella to fit. Rain fell on his head as he poked it out of the opening in the roof, where the stairwell ended. The roof was made of tile set into hardened crem, and Zahel lay there in a hammock he'd strung between two poles. Kaladin thought they might be lightning rods, which didn't strike him as safe. A tarp hung above the hammock and kept Zahel almost dry. The ardent swung gently, eyes closed, holding a square bottle of hard honu, a type of lavis grain liquor. Kaladin inspected the rooftop, judging his ability to cross those sloped tiles without toppling off and breaking his neck. "Ever been to the Purelake, bridgeman?" Zahel asked. "No," Kaladin said. "One of my men talks about it, though." "What have you heard?" "It's an ocean that's so shallow, you can wade across it." "It's ridiculously shallow," Zahel said. "Like an endless bay, mere feet deep. Warm water. Calm breezes. Reminds me of home. Not like this cold, damp, godsforsaken place." "So why aren't you there instead of here?" "Because I can't stand being reminded of home, idiot." Oh. "Why are we talking about it, then?" "Because you were wondering why we made our own little Purelake down below." "I was?" "Of course you were. Damnation boy. I know you well enough by now to know that questions bother you. You don't think like a spearman." "Spearmen can't be curious?" "No. Because if they are, they either get killed or they end up showing someone in charge how smart they are. Then they get put somewhere more useful." Kaladin raised an eyebrow, waiting for more explanation. Finally, he sighed, and asked, "Why have you blocked off the courtyard below?" "Why do you think?" "You are a really annoying person, Zahel. Do you realize that?" "Sure do." He took a drink of his honu. "I assume," Kaladin said, "that you blocked off the front of the practice grounds so that the rain wouldn't wash the sand away." "Excellent deduction," Zahel said. "Like fresh blue paint on a wall." "Whatever that means. The problem is, why is it necessary to keep the sand in the courtyard? Why not just put it away, like you do before highstorms?" "Did you know," Zahel said, "that rains during the Weeping don't drop crem?" "I . . ." Did he know that? Did it matter? "Good thing too," Zahel said, "or our entire camp here would end up clogged with the stuff. Anyway, rain like this, it's great for washing." "You're telling me that you've turned the floor of the dueling grounds into a bath?" "Sure did." "You wash in that?" "Sure do. Not ourselves, of course." "Then what?" "Sand." Kaladin frowned, then peered over the side, looking at the pool below. "Every day," Zahel said, "we go in there and stir it up. The sand settles back down to the bottom, and all the yuck floats away, carried by the rain in little streams out of the camp. Did you ever consider that sand might need washing?" "No, actually." "Well it does. After a year's worth of being kicked by stinky bridgeman feet and equally stinkybut far more refinedlighteyes feet, after a year of having people like me spill food on it, or having animals find their way in here to do business, the sand needs cleaning." "Why are we talking about this?" "Because it's important," Zahel said, taking a drink. "Or something. I don't know. You came to me, kid, interrupting my vacation. That means you have to listen to me blab." "You're supposed to say something profound." "Did you miss the part about me being on vacation?" Kaladin stood in the rain. "Do you know where the King's Wit is?" "That fool, Dust? Not here, blessedly. Why?" Kaladin needed someone to talk to, and had spent the better part of the day searching for Wit. He hadn't found the man, though he had broken down and bought some chouta from a lonely street vendor. It had tasted good. That hadn't helped his mood. So, he'd given up on finding Wit and had come to Zahel instead. That appeared to have been a mistake. Kaladin sighed, turning back down the stairs. "What was it you wanted?" Zahel called to him. The man had cracked an eye, looking toward Kaladin. "Have you ever had to choose between two equally distasteful choices?" "Every day I choose to keep breathing." "I worry something awful is going to happen," Kaladin said. "I can prevent it, but the awful thing . . . it might be best for everyone if it does happen." "Huh," Zahel said. "No advice?" Kaladin asked. "Choose the option," Zahel said, rearranging his pillow, "that makes it easiest for you to sleep at night." The old ardent closed his eyes and settled back. "That's what I wish I'd done." Kaladin continued down the steps. Below, he didn't get out his umbrella. He was already soaked anyway. Instead, he poked through the racks at the side of the practice grounds until he found a spearreal, not practice. Then he set down his crutch and hobbled out into the water. There, he fell into a spearman's stance and closed his eyes. Rain fell around him. It splattered in the water of the pool, sprinkled the rooftop, pattered the streets outside. Kaladin felt drained, like his blood had been sucked from him. The gloom made him want to sit still. Instead, he started dancing with the rain. He went through spear forms, doing his best to avoid putting weight on his wounded leg. He splashed in the waters. He sought peace and purpose in the comfortable forms. He didn't find either. His balance was off, and his leg screamed. The rain didn't accompany him; it just annoyed him. Worse, the wind didn't blow. The air felt stale. Kaladin stumbled over his own feet. He twisted the spear about him, then dropped it clumsily. It spun away to splash into the pool. As he fetched it, he noticed the ardents watching him with looks ranging from befuddled to amused. He tried again. Simple spear forms. No spinning the weapon, no showing off. Step step thrust. The spear's shaft felt wrong in his fingers. Off balance. Storms. He'd come here seeking solace, but he only grew more and more frustrated as he tried to practice. How much of his ability with the spear had come from his powers? Was he nothing without them? He dropped the spear again after trying a simple twist and thrust. He reached for it, and found a rainspren sitting next to it in the water, looking upward, unblinking. He snatched the spear with a growl, then looked up toward the sky. "He deserves it!" he bellowed at those clouds. Rain pelted him. "Give me a reason why he doesn't!" Kaladin yelled, uncaring if the ardents heard. "It might not be his fault, and he might be trying, but he's still failing." Silence. "It's right to remove the wounded limb," Kaladin whispered. "This is what we have to do. To . . . To . . ." To stay alive. Where had those words come from? Gotta do what you can to stay alive, son. Turn a liability into an advantage whenever you can. Tien's death. That moment, that horrible moment, when he watched unable to do anything as his brother died. Tien's own squadleader had sacrificed the untrained to gain a moment's advantage. That squadleader had spoken to Kaladin after it was all over. Gotta do what you can to stay alive. . . . It made a twisted, horrible kind of sense. It hadn't been Tien's fault. Tien had tried. He'd still failed. So they'd killed him. Kaladin fell to his knees in the water. "Almighty, oh Almighty." The king . . . The king was Dalinar's Tien. * * * "Attack?" Adolin asked. "Are you certain that is what my father said?" The young woman who had run the message nodded a rainslicked head, looking miserable in her slitted dress and runner's sash. "You're to stop that singing, if you can, Brightlord. Your father indicated it was important." Adolin looked over his battalions, which held the southern flank. Just beyond them, on one of the three plateaus that surrounded their army, the Parshendi sang a horrible song. Sureblood danced, snorting. "I don't like it either," Adolin said softly, patting the horse on the neck. That song put him on edge. And those threads of red light on their arms, in their hands. What were those? "Perel," he said to one of his field commanders, "tell the men to get ready for the mark. We're going to charge across those bridges onto the southern plateau. Heavy infantry first, shortspears behind, longspears at the ready in case we're overrun. I want the men ready to form blocks on the other side until we're sure where the Parshendi lines will fall. Storms, I wish we had archers. Go!" The word spread, and Adolin nudged Sureblood up beside one of the bridges, which had already been set. His bridgeman guards for the day followed, a pair named Skar and Drehy. "You two going to sit out?" Adolin asked the bridgemen, his eyes forward. "Your captain doesn't like you going into battle against Parshendi." "To Damnation with that!" Drehy said. "We'll fight, sir. Those aren't Parshendi anyway. Not anymore." "Good answer. They'll advance once we start our assault. We need to hold the bridgehead for the rest of our army. Try to keep up with me, if you can." He glanced over his shoulder, waiting. Watching until . . . A large blue gemstone rose into the air, hoisted high on a distant pole near the command tent. "Go!" Adolin kicked Sureblood into motion, thundering across the bridge and splashing through a pool on the other side. Rainspren wavered. His two bridgemen followed at a run. Behind them, the heavy infantry in thick armor with hammers and axesperfect for splitting Parshendi carapacesurged into motion. The bulk of the Parshendi continued their chanting. A smaller group broke off, perhaps two thousand in number, and moved to intercept Adolin. He growled, leaning low, Shardblade appearing in his hand. If they A flash of light. The world lurched, and Adolin found himself skidding on the ground, his Shardplate grinding against stones. The armor absorbed the blow of the fall, but could do nothing for Adolin's own shock. The world spun, and a spray of water spurted in through the slits in his helm, washing over his face. As he came to rest, he heaved himself backward, up to his feet. He stumbled, clanking, thrashing about in case any Parshendi had gotten close. He blinked away water inside his helm, then oriented himself on a change in the landscape in front of him. White amid the brown and grey. What was that . . . He finally blinked his eyes clear enough to get a good look. The whiteness was a horse, fallen to the ground. Adolin screamed something raw, a sound that echoed in his helm. He ignored the shouts of soldiers, the sound of rain, the sudden and unnatural crack behind him. He ran to the body on the ground. Sureblood. "No, no, no," Adolin said, skidding to his knees beside the horse. The animal bore a strange, branching burn all down the side of his white coat. Wide, jagged. Sureblood's dark eyes, open to the rain, did not blink. Adolin raised his hands, suddenly hesitant to touch the animal. A youth on an unfamiliar field. Sureblood wasn't moving. More nervous that day than during the duel that won his Blade. Shouts. Another crack in the air, sharp, immediate. They pick their rider, son. We fixate on Shards, but any mancourageous or cowardcan bond a Blade. Not so here, on this ground. Only the worthy win here . . . Move. Grieve later. Move! Adolin roared, leaping to his feet and charging past the two bridgemen who nervously stood guard over him with spears. He started the process of summoning his Blade and ran toward the fighting up ahead. Only moments had passed, but already the Alethi lines were collapsing. Some infantry advanced in clusters while others had hunkered down, stunned and confused. Another flash, accompanied by a cracking of the air. Lightning. Red lightning. It appeared in flashes from groups of Parshendi, then was gone in the blink of an eye. It left a bright afterimageglowing, forkedthat briefly obscured Adolin's sight. Ahead of him, men dropped, fried in their armor. Adolin shouted as he charged, bellowing for the men to hold their lines. More cracks sounded, but the strikes didn't seem well aimed. They'd sometimes flash backward or would follow strange paths, rarely going straight toward the Alethi. As he ran, he saw a blast come from a pair of Parshendi, but it arced immediately down into the ground. The Parshendi stared downward, befuddled. It was as if the lightning worked . . . well, like lightning from the sky, not following any sort of predictable path. "Charge them, you cremlings!" Adolin shouted, running through the middle of the soldiers. "Back into your lines! It's just like advancing on archers! Keep your heads. Tighten up. If we break, we're dead!" He wasn't certain how much of that they heard, but the image of him yelling, crashing into the line of Parshendi, did something. Shouts rose from officers, lines reformed. Lightning flashed right at Adolin. The sound was incredible, and the light. He stood in place, blinded. When it faded, he found himself completely unharmed. He looked down at the armor, which was vibrating softlya hum that rattled his skin in a strangely comforting way. Nearby, another crack of lightning left a small group of Parshendi, but it didn't blind him. His helmwhich as always was partially translucent from the insidedarkened in a jagged streak, perfectly overlaying the lightning. Adolin grinned with clenched teeth, feeling a savage satisfaction as he pushed into the Parshendi and swung his Shardblade through their necks. By the old stories, the suit he wore had been created to fight these very monsters. Though these Parshendi soldiers were sleeker and more ferociouslooking than the ones he'd previously fought, their eyes burned just as easily. Then they dropped dead and something wiggled out of their chestssmall red spren, like tiny lightning, that zipped into the air and vanished. "They can be killed!" one of the soldiers yelled nearby. "They can die!" Others raised the call, passing it down the lines. Obvious though the revelation seemed, it bolstered his troops, and they surged forward. They can die. * * * Shallan drew. Frantic. A map in ink. Each line precise. The large sheet, crafted at her order, covered a wide board on the floor. It was the largest drawing she'd ever done; she'd filled it in, section by section, as they traveled. She listened with half an ear to the other scholars in the tent. They were a distraction, but an important one. Another line, rippled on the sides, forming a thin plateau. It was a copy of the one she'd drawn in seven other places on the map. The Plains were a fourfold radial pattern mirrored down the center of each quadrant, and so anything she drew in one quadrant she could repeat in the others, mirrored as appropriate. The eastern side was worn down, yes, so her map wouldn't be accurate in that area but for cohesion, she needed to finish those parts. So she could see the whole pattern. "Scout reporting in," a messenger woman said, bursting into the tent, letting in a gust of the wet wind. This unexpected wind . . . it almost felt like the wind before a highstorm. "What is the report?" Inadara asked. The severe woman was supposed to be a great scholar. She reminded Shallan of her father's ardents. In the corner of the room, Prince Renarin stood in his Shardplate, arms folded. He had orders to protect them all, should the Parshendi try to break onto the command plateau. "The large center plateau is just as the parshman told us," the scout said, breathless. "It's only one plateau over, to the east." Lyn was a solidlooking woman with long black hair and keen eyes. "It's obviously inhabited, though there doesn't seem to be anyone there right now." "And the plateaus surrounding it?" Inadara asked. "Shim and Felt are scouting those," Lyn said. "Felt should be back soon. I can do a rough drawing of what I saw of the center plateau for you." "Do it," Inadara said. "We need to find that Oathgate." Shallan wiped a stray drop of waterfallen from Lyn's coatoff her map, then continued drawing. The army's path from the warcamps inward had allowed her to extrapolate and draw eight chains of plateaus, two each mirroredstarting from the four "sides" of the Plains and working inward. She had almost completed the last of the eight arms reaching toward the center. This close, earlier scout reportsand what Shallan had seen herself allowed her to fill in everything around the center. Rlain's explanations had helped, but he hadn't been able to draw out the center plateaus for her. He'd never paid attention to their shapes, and Shallan needed precision. Fortunately, earlier reports had almost been enough. She didn't need much more. She was almost done. "What do you think?" Lyn asked. "Show it to Brightness Shallan." Inadara sounded displeased, which seemed her normal state. Shallan glanced over Lyn's hastily sketched map, then nodded, turning back to her drawing. It would be better if she could see the center plateau herself, but the corner this woman had drawn gave Shallan an idea. "Not going to say anything?" Inadara asked. "Not done yet," Shallan said, dipping her pen in the ink. "We have been given an order by the highprince himself to find the Oathgate." "I will." Something crashed outside, like distant lightning. "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. "Bad. Very bad." Inadara looked at Pattern, who dimpled the floor near Shallan. "I do not like this thing. Spren should not speak. It may be of them, a Voidbringer." "I am not a Voidspren," Pattern said. "Brightness Shallan" "He's not a Voidspren," Shallan said absently. "We should study it," Inadara said. "How long did you say it has been following you?" A heavy footstep sounded on the floor, Renarin stepping forward. Shallan would have preferred to keep Pattern secret, but when the winds had started picking up, he'd started buzzing loudly. There was no avoiding it now that he'd drawn the scholars' attention. Renarin leaned down. He seemed fascinated by Pattern. He wasn't the only one. "It is likely involved," Inadara said. "You should not dismiss one of my theories so quickly. I still think it might be related to the Voidbringers." "Know you nothing of Patterns, old human?" Pattern said, huffing. When had he picked up how to huff? "Voidbringers have no pattern. Besides, I have read of them in your lore. They speak of spindly arms like bone, and horrific faces. I should think, if you wish to find one, the mirror might be a location where you can begin your search." Inadara recoiled. Then she stomped away, moving to chat with Brightness Velat and the ardent Isasik about their interpretation of Shallan's map. Shallan smiled as she drew. "That was clever." "I am trying to learn," Pattern replied. "Insults in particular will be of great use to my people, as they are truths and lies combined in a quite interesting manner." The pops continued outside. "What is that?" she asked softly, finishing another plateau. "Stormspren," Pattern said. "They are a variety of Voidspren. It is not good. I feel something very dangerous brewing. Draw more quickly." "The Oathgate must be in that center plateau somewhere," Inadara said to her group of scholars. "We will never search the entire thing in time," said one of the ardents, a man who seemed to be constantly removing his spectacles and wiping them down. He put them back on. "That plateau is by far the largest we've found on the Plains." It was a problem. How to find the Oathgate? It could be anywhere. No, Shallan thought, drawing with precise motions, the old maps placed what Jasnah thought was the Oathgate southwest of the city center. Unfortunately, she still didn't have a scale for reference. The city was too ancient, and all the maps were copies of copies of copies or recreations from descriptions. She was certain by now that Stormseat hadn't made up the entire Shattered Plainsthe city hadn't been nearly so huge. Structures like the warcamps had been outbuildings, or satellite cities. But that was just a guess. She needed something concrete. Some sign. The tent flaps opened again. It had grown cold outside. Was the rain harder than it had been? "Damnation!" the newcomer swore, a thin man in a scout's uniform. "Have you seen what is happening out there? Why are we split across the plateaus? Wasn't the plan to fight a defensive battle?" "Your report?" Inadara asked. "Get me a towel and some paper," the scout said. "I rounded the southern side of the central plateau. I'll draw what I saw . . . but Damnation! They're throwing lightning, Brightness. Throwing it! It's insane. How do we fight such things?" Shallan finished the last plateau on her drawing. She settled back on her heels, lowering her pen. The Shattered Plains, drawn almost in their entirety. But what was she doing? What was the point? "We will make an expedition into the central plateau," Inadara said. "Brightlord Renarin, we will need your protection. Perhaps in the Parshendi city we will find the elderly or the workers, and we can protect them, as Brightlord Dalinar has instructed. They might know about the Oathgate. If not, we can begin breaking into buildings and searching for clues." Too slow, Shallan thought. The newly arrived scout stepped up to Shallan's large map. He leaned over, inspecting it as he dried himself off with a towel. Shallan gave him a glare. If he dripped water on this after all she'd done . . . "That's wrong," he said. Wrong? Her art? Of course it wasn't wrong. "Where?" she asked, exhausted. "That plateau there," the man said, pointing. "It's not long and thin, as you drew it. It's a perfect circle, with big gaps between it and the plateaus on its east and west." "That's unlikely," Shallan said. "If it were that way" She blinked. If it were that way, it wouldn't match the pattern. * * * "Well then, find Brightness Shallan a squad of soldiers and do as she says!" Dalinar said, turning and raising his arm against the wind. Renarin nodded. Blessedly, he'd agreed to put on his Plate for the battle, rather than continuing on with Bridge Four. Dalinar barely understood the lad these days. . . . Storms. Dalinar had never known a man who could look awkward in Shardplate, but his son managed it. The sheet of winddriven rain passed. Light from blue lanterns reflected from Renarin's wet armor. "Go," Dalinar said. "Protect the scholars on their mission." "I . . ." Renarin said. "Father, I don't know . . ." "It wasn't a request, Renarin!" Dalinar shouted. "Do as you're told, or give that storming Plate to someone who will!" The boy stumbled back, then saluted with a metallic slap. Dalinar pointed at Gaval, who barked orders, gathering a squad of soldiers. Renarin followed Gaval as the two of them moved off. Stormfather. The sky had grown darker and darker. They'd need Navani's fabrials soon. That wind came in bursts, blowing rain that was entirely too strong for the Weeping. "We have to interrupt that singing!" Dalinar shouted against the rain, making his way to the edge of the plateau, joined by officers and messengers, including Rlain and several members of Bridge Four. "Parshman. Is this storm their doing?" "I believe so, Brightlord Dalinar!" On the other side of the chasm, Aladar's army fought a desperate battle against the Parshendi. Red lightning came in bursts, but according to field reports, the Parshendi didn't know how to control it. It could be very dangerous to those who stood close by, but was not the terrible weapon it had first seemed. In direct combat, unfortunately, these new Parshendi were another thing entirely. A group of them prowled close to the chasm, where they ripped through a squad of spearmen like a whitespine through a patch of ferns. They fought with a ferocity beyond what the Parshendi had ever shown on the plateau runs, and their weapons connected with flashes of red. It was difficult to watch, but Dalinar's place was not out there fighting. Not today. "Aladar's eastern flank needs reinforcement," Dalinar said. "What do we have?" "Light infantry reserves," General Khal said, wearing only his uniform. His son wore his Shards, fighting with Roion's army. "Fifteenth spear division from Sebarial's army. But those were supposed to support Brightlord Adolin. . . ." "He'll survive without them. Get those men over here and see Aladar reinforced. Tell him to punch through to those Parshendi in the back, engage the ones singing at all costs. What's Navani's status?" "She is ready with the devices, Brightlord," a messenger said. "She wants to know where she should begin." "Roion's flank," Dalinar said immediately. He sensed a disaster brewing there. Speeches were all well and good, but even with Khal's son fighting on that front, Roion's troops were the worst he had. Teleb was supporting them with some of Sebarial's troops, who were surprisingly good. The man himself was practically useless in a battle, but he knew how to hire the right peopleand that had always been his genius. Sebarial probably assumed that Dalinar didn't know that. He'd kept many of Sebarial's troops as a reserve up until now. With them on the field, they'd committed almost every soldier they had. Dalinar hiked back toward the command tent, passing Shallan, Inadara, some bridgemen, and a squad of soldiersRenarin includedcrossing the plateau at a trot, heading out on their mission. They'd have to skirt across the southern plateau, near the fighting, to get where they were going. Kelek speed their way. Dalinar himself pushed through the rain, soaked to the very bones, reading the battle through what he could see of the flanks. His force had the size advantage, as anticipated. But now, this red lightning, this wind . . . The Parshendi moved through the darkness and the gusts of wind with ease while the humans slipped, squinted, and were battered. Still, the Alethi were holding their own. The problem was that this was only half of the Parshendi. If the other half attacked, his people would be in serious troublebut they didn't attack, so they must consider that singing to be important. They saw the wind they were creating as more damaging, more deadly to the humans, than simply joining the battle. That terrified him. What was coming would be worse. "I am sorry that you have to die this way." Dalinar stood still. Rain streamed down. He looked to the flock of messengers, aides, bodyguards, and officers who attended him. "Who spoke?" They looked at one another. Wait . . . He recognized that voice, didn't he? It was familiar to him. Yes. He'd heard it many times. In his visions. It was the voice of the Almighty. There is one you will watch. Though all of them have some relevance to precognition, Moelach is one of the most powerful in this regard. His touch seeps into a soul as it breaks apart from the body, creating manifestations powered by the spark of death itself. But no, this is a distraction. Deviation. Kingship. We must discuss the nature of kingship. From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk Drawer: paragraph 15 Kaladin limped up the switchbacks to the palace, his leg a knotted mass of pain. Almost falling as he reached the doors, he slumped against them, gasping, his crutch under one arm, spear in the other hand. As if he could do anything with that. Have . . . to get . . . to the king. . . . How would he get Elhokar away? Moash would be watching. Storms. The assassination could happen any day . . . any hour now. Surely Dalinar was already far enough from the warcamps. Keep. Moving. Kaladin stumbled into the entryway. No guards at the doors. Bad sign. Should he have raised the alarm? There weren't any soldiers in camp to help, and if he'd come in force, Graves and his men would know something was wrong. Alone, Kaladin might be able to see the king. His best hope was to get Elhokar to safety quietly. Fool, Kaladin thought to himself. You change your mind now? After all of this? What are you doing? But storm it . . . the king tried. He actually tried. The man was arrogant, perhaps incapable, but he tried. He was sincere. Kaladin stopped, exhausted, leg screaming, and leaned against the wall. Shouldn't this be easier? Now that he'd made the decision, shouldn't he be focused, confident, energized? He felt none of that. He felt wrung out, confused, and uncertain. He pushed himself forward. Keep going. Almighty send that he wasn't too late. Was he back to praying now? He picked through darkened corridors. Shouldn't there be more light? With some difficulty, he reached the king's upper rooms, with the conference chamber and its balcony to the side. Two men in Bridge Four uniforms guarded the door, but Kaladin didn't recognize either of them. They weren't Bridge Fourthey weren't even members of the old King's Guard. Storms. Kaladin hobbled up to them, knowing he must look a sight, soaked through and through, limping on a leg thathe noticedwas trailing blood. He'd split the sutures on his wounds. "Stop," said one of the men. The fellow had a chin so cleft, it looked like he'd taken an axe to the face as a baby. He looked Kaladin up and down. "You're the one they call Stormblessed." "You're Graves's men." The two looked at each other. "It's all right," Kaladin said. "I'm with you. Is Moash here?" "He's off for the moment," the soldier said. "Getting some sleep. It's an important day." I'm not too late, Kaladin thought. Luck was with him. "I want to be part of what you're doing." "It's taken care of, bridgeman," the guard said. "Go back to your barrack and pretend nothing is happening." Kaladin leaned in close, as if to whisper something. The guard leaned forward. So Kaladin dropped his crutch and slammed his spear up between the man's legs. Kaladin immediately turned, spinning on his good leg and dragging the other one, whipping his spear toward the other man. The man got his spear up to block, and tried to shout. "To arms! To" Kaladin slammed against him, knocking aside his spear. Kaladin dropped his own spear and grabbed the man by the neck with numb, wet fingers and cracked his head against the wall. Then he twisted and dropped, bringing his elbow down onto Cleftchin's head, driving it down into the floor. Both men fell still. Lightheaded from the sudden exertion, Kaladin slammed himself back against the door. The world spun. At least he knew he could still fight without Stormlight. He found himself laughing, though it turned into a cough. Had he really just attacked those men? He was committed now. Storms, he didn't even really know why he was doing this. The king's sincerity was part of it, but that wasn't the true reason, not deep down. He knew this was what he should do, but why? The thought of the king dying for no good reason made him sick. It reminded him of what had been done to Tien. But that wasn't the full reason either. Storms, he wasn't making any sense, not even to himself. Neither guard moved save for a few twitches. Kaladin coughed and coughed, gasping for breath. No time for weakness. He reached up a clawlike hand and twisted the door handle, forcing it open. He half fell into the room, then stumbled to his feet. "Your Majesty?" he called, propping himself up on his spear and dragging his bad leg. He reached the back of a couch and used it to pull himself fully upright. Where was the The king lay on the couch, unmoving. * * * Adolin swept broadly with his Blade, maintaining perfect Windstance, the sword's point spraying water as he sheared through the neck of a Parshendi soldier. Red lightning crackled from the corpse in a bright flare, connecting the soldier to the ground as he died. Nearby Alethi were careful not to step in puddles beside the corpse. They had learned the hard way that this strange lightning could kill quickly via water. Raising his sword and charging, Adolin led a rush against the nearest Parshendi group. Curse this storm and the winds that had brought it! Fortunately, the darkness had been pushed back somewhat, as Navani had sent fabrials to bathe the battlefield in an extraordinarily even white light. Adolin and his team clashed again with the Parshendi. However, as soon as he got among the enemy, he felt something tug on his left arm. A loop of rope? He jerked back. No rope could hold Shardplate. He growled and yanked the rope free of the hands holding it. Then he jerked as another rope looped his neck and pulled him backward. He shouted, spinning and sweeping his Blade through the rope, severing it. Three more loops leaped from the darkness for him; the Parshendi had sent an entire team. Adolin turned to defensive sweeps, as he'd been trained by Zahel to resist a dedicated rope strike. They'd have strung other ropes across the ground in front of him, expecting that he'd charge them . . . Yes, there they were. Adolin backed away, slicing free the ropes that reached him. Unfortunately, his men had been depending on him to break the Parshendi line. As he backed away instead, the enemy pressed against the Alethi line in force. As always, they didn't use traditional battle formations, instead attacking in squads and pairs. That was frightfully effective on this chaotic, rainsoaked battlefield, with cracks of lightning and bursts of wind. Perel, the field commander that he'd put in charge near the lights, called the retreat for Adolin's flank. Adolin let out a series of curses, cutting loose one final rope and stepping backward, sword out in case the Parshendi pursued. They didn't. Two figures, however, shadowed him as he joined the retreat. "Still alive, bridgemen?" Adolin asked. "Still alive," Skar said. "You've got some loops of rope stuck to you still, sir," Drehy said. Adolin held out his arm and let Drehy cut them free with his side knife. Over his shoulder, Adolin watched the Parshendi reform their lines. From farther back, the sound of that harsh chanting reached him between crashes of lightning and bursts of wind. "They keep sending teams to engage and distract me," Adolin said. "They don't intend to defeat me; they just want to keep me out of the battle." "They'll have to really fight you sooner or later," Drehy said, cutting off another of the ropes. Drehy reached up and ran his hand over his bald head, wiping the rain off. "They can't just leave a Shardbearer alone." "Actually," Adolin said, narrowing his eyes, listening to that chanting. "That's exactly what they're doing." Through sheets of windborne rain, Adolin jogged in a clanking run up to the command position, near the lights. Perelwrapped in a large stormcoatstood there bellowing orders. He gave Adolin a quick salute. "Status?" Adolin asked. "Treading water, Brightlord." "I have no idea what that means," Adolin said. "Swimming term, sir," Perel said. "We're fighting back and forth, but we're not making any headway. We're fairly evenly matched; each side is looking for an edge. I'm most worried about those Parshendi reserves. They should have committed those by now." "The reserves?" Adolin asked, peering across the dim plateau. "You mean the singers." To both right and left, Alethi troops engaged other Parshendi units. Men shouted and screamed, weapons clashed, the familiar deadly sounds of a battlefield. "Yes, sir," Perel said. "They're up against that rock formation at the middle of the plateau, singing their storming hearts out." Adolin remembered that rock outcropping, looming in the dim light. It was easily large enough for a battalion on top. "Could we climb it from behind?" "In this rain, Brightlord?" Perel asked. "Not likely. Maybe you could, but would you really want to go alone?" Adolin waited for the familiar eagerness to urge him forward, the desire to rush into the fight without concern for the consequences. He'd trained himself to resist that urge, and was surprised to find it . . . gone. Nothing. He frowned. He was tired. Was that the reason? He considered the situation, thinking to the sound of rain on his helmet. We need to get to those Parshendi at the back, he thought. Father wants the reserves engaged, the song broken off . . . What had Shallan said about these inner plateaus? And the rock formations on them? "Gather me a battalion," Adolin said. "A thousand men, heavy infantry. Once I've been gone with them for a half hour, send the rest of the men in a full assault against the Parshendi. I'm going to try something, and I want you to provide a distraction." * * * "You're dead," Dalinar shouted toward the sky. He spun about, still on the central plateau between the three battlefields, startling the aides and attendants near him. "You told me you had been killed!" Rain pelted his face. Were his ears playing tricks on him in this havoc of rain and shouting? "I am not the Almighty," the voice said. Dalinar turned, searching among his startled companions. Four bridgemen in stormcoats stepped back, as if frightened. His captains watched the clouds unsteadily, holding hands on swords. "Did any of you hear that voice?" Dalinar asked. Women and men alike shook heads. "Are you . . . hearing the Almighty?" asked one of the messenger women. "Yes." It was the simplest answer, though he wasn't sure what was happening. He continued to cross the central plateau, intending to check on Adolin's battlefront. "I am sorry," the voice repeated. Unlike in the visions, Dalinar could find no avatar speaking the words. They came out of nowhere. "You have striven hard. But I can do nothing for you." "Who are you?" Dalinar hissed. "I am the one left behind," the voice said. It wasn't exactly as he'd heard it in the visions; this voice had a depth to it. A density. "I am the sliver of Him that remains. I saw His corpse, saw Him die when Odium murdered Him. And I . . . I fled. To continue as I always have. The piece of God left in this world, the winds that men must feel." Was he responding to Dalinar's question, or speaking a mere monologue? In the visions, Dalinar had originally assumed he was having conversations with this voice, only to find that its half of the seeming dialogue had been preset. He could not tell if this was the same or not. Storms . . . was he in the middle of a vision now? He froze in place, suddenly imagining a horrible picture of himself, sprawled on the floor of the palace, having imagined everything leading up to this battle in the rain. No, he thought forcefully. I will not travel down that path. He had always recognized when he was in a vision before; he had no reason to believe that had changed. The reserves he'd ordered for Aladar trotted past, spearmen with points toward the sky. That would be storming dangerous if real lightning came, but they didn't have much choice. Dalinar waited for the voice to say more, but nothing happened. He proceeded, and soon approached Adolin's plateau. Was that thunder? No. Dalinar turned and picked out a horse galloping across the plateau toward him, a messenger on its back. He held up a hand, interrupting a tactical report by Captain Javih. "Brightlord!" the messenger shouted. She reared the horse. "Brightlord Teleb has fallen! Highprince Roion has been routed. His lines are broken, his remaining men surrounded by Parshendi! He's trapped on the northern plateau!" "Damnation! Captain Khal?" "Still up, fighting toward where Roion was last seen. He's nearly overwhelmed." Dalinar spun to Javih. "Reserves?" "I don't know what we have left," the man said, face pale in the dim light. "Depends on if any have rotated out." "Find out and bring them here!" Dalinar said, running to the messenger. "Off," he told her. "Sir?" "Off!" The woman scrambled from the saddle as Dalinar placed foot into stirrup and swung into position. He turned the horsethankful, for once, he didn't have on any Shardplate. This light horse wouldn't have been able to carry him. "Gather whatever you can and follow!" he shouted. "I need men, even if you have to pull that battalion of spearmen back from Aladar." Captain Javih's reply was lost in the rain as Dalinar leaned low and cued the horse with his heels. The animal snorted, and Dalinar had to fight it before getting it to move. The pops of lightning in the distance had the creature skittish. Once pointed the right direction, he gave the horse its head, and it galloped eagerly. Dalinar crossed the plateau in a rush, triage tents, command posts, and food stations passing in a blur. As he neared the northern plateau, he reined in the horse and scanned the area for Navani. No sign of her, though he did see several large tarps laid on the ground here expansive squares of black cloth. She'd been at work. He called a question to an engineer, and she pointed, so Dalinar rode along the chasm in that direction. He passed a succession of other tarps that had been arranged on the stone. Across the chasm to his left, men died with shouts and screams. He saw firsthand how terribly Roion's battle was progressing. The danger was manifest in broken groups of men flying beleaguered banners, split into vulnerable small bunches by redeyed enemies. The Alethi would fight on, but with their line fragmenting, their prospects were grim. Dalinar remembered fighting like that himself two months ago, surrounded by a sea of enemies, without hope for salvation. Dalinar pushed his horse faster, and soon spotted Navani. She stood beneath an umbrella directing a group of workers with another large tarp. "Navani!" Dalinar shouted, pulling his horse to a slippery stop across the tarp from her. "I need a miracle!" "Working on it," she shouted back. "No time for working. Execute your plan. Now." He was too distant to see her glare, but he felt it. Fortunately, she waved workers away from her current tarp and began shouting orders to her engineers. The women ran up to the chasm, where a line of rocks was arrayed. They were attached to ropes, Dalinar thought, though he wasn't sure how this process worked. Navani shouted instructions. Too much time, Dalinar thought, anxious, watching across the chasm. Had they recovered Teleb's Shards? He couldn't spare grief for the man, not now. They needed those Shards. Behind Dalinar, soldiers gathered. Roion's archers, finest in the warcamps, had been useless in this rain. The engineers backed up at a barked order from Navani, and the workers shoved the line of some forty rocks into the chasm. As the rocks fell, tarps jumped fifty feet into the air, pulled at the front corners and centers. In an instant, a long line of improvised pavilions flanked the chasm. "Move!" Dalinar said, urging his horse between two of the pavilions. "Archers forward!" Men dashed into the protected areas under the tarps, some muttering at the lack of any visible poles holding them in the air. Navani had pulled up only the fronts, so the tarps slanted backward, away from the chasm. The rain streamed down in that direction. They also had sides, like tents, so only the open faces were toward Roion's battlefront. Dalinar swung from the horse and handed the reins to a worker. He jogged under one of the pavilions to where archers were forming ranks. Navani entered, carrying a large sack over her shoulder. She opened it to reveal a large glowing garnet suspended within a delicate wire lacework fabrial. She fiddled with it for a moment, then stepped back. "We really should have had more time to test this," she warned to Dalinar, folding her arms. "Attractors are new inventions. I'm still half afraid this thing will suck the blood out of anyone who touches it." It didn't. Instead, water quickly started to pool around the thing. Storms, it worked! The fabrial was pulling moisture from the air. Roion's archers removed bowstrings from protected pockets, bending bows and stringing them at the orders of their lieutenants. Many of the men here were lighteyesarchery was seen as an acceptable Calling for a lighteyed man of modest means. Not everyone could be an officer. The archers began loosing waves of arrows across the chasm into the Parshendi who had surrounded Roion's forces. "Good," Dalinar said, watching the arrows fly. "Very good." "The rain and wind are still going to make aiming the arrows difficult," Navani said. "And I don't know how well the fabrials will work; with the front of the pavilions open, humidity is going to flood in constantly. We might run out of Stormlight after just a short time." "It's enough," Dalinar said. The arrows made an almost immediate difference, drawing Parshendi attention away from the beleaguered men. It wasn't a maneuver to try unless you were desperatethe risk of hitting allies was great but Roion's archers proved deserving of their reputation. He pulled Navani close with one arm. "You did well." Then he called for his horsehis horse, not that wild messenger beastas he charged out of the pavilion. Those archers would give him an opening. Hopefully it wasn't too late for Roion. * * * No! Kaladin thought, rounding the couch to the king's side. Was he dead? There was no obvious wound. The king shifted, then groaned in a lazy way and sat upright. Kaladin let out a deep breath. An empty wine bottle rested on the end table, and Kaladin could smell the spilled wine now that he was closer. "Bridgeman?" Elhokar's speech was slurred. "Have you come to gloat over me?" "Storms, Elhokar," Kaladin said. "How much have you had?" "They all . . . they all talk about me," Elhokar said, flopping down on the couch. "My own guards . . . every one. Bad king, they say. Everyone hates him, they say." Kaladin felt a chill. "They wanted you to drink, Elhokar. Makes their job easier." "Huh?" Storms. The man was barely conscious. "Come on," Kaladin said. "Assassins are coming for you. We're getting out of here." "Assassins?" Elhokar leapt to his feet, then wobbled. "He wears white. I knew he'd come . . . but then . . . he only cared about Dalinar . . . Not even the assassin thinks I'm worthy of the throne. . . ." Kaladin managed to get under Elhokar's arm, holding his spear for support with one hand. The king slumped against him, and Kaladin's leg cried out. "Please, Your Majesty," Kaladin said, almost collapsing, "I need you to try to walk." "Assassins probably want you, bridgeman," the king muttered. "You're more a leader than I am. I wish . . . wish you'd teach me . . ." Thankfully, Elhokar then did support himself to an extent. It was a struggle to walk the two of them to the doorway, where the guard's body still lay Body? Where was the other one? Kaladin twisted out of the king's grip as a blur with a knife lunged at him. By instinct, Kaladin snapped his spear haft backbringing his hands up near to the head for a closequarters fightthen thrust. The spearhead sank in deep into Cleftchin's stomach. The man grunted. But he hadn't been lunging for Kaladin. He'd plunged his knife into the king's side. Cleftchin flopped to the floor, falling off Kaladin's spear and dropping his knife. Elhokar reacheda stunned expression on his faceto his side. The hand came away bloody. "I'm dead," Elhokar whispered, regarding the blood. In that moment, Kaladin's pain and weakness seemed to fade. The moment of panic was a moment of strength, and he used it to rip at Elhokar's clothing while kneeling on his good leg. The knife had glanced off a rib. The king was bleeding heavily, but it was a very survivable wound, with medical attention. "Keep pressure on that," Kaladin said, pushing a cut section of the king's shirt against the wound, then placing the king's hand over it. "We need to get out of the palace. Find safety somewhere." The dueling grounds, maybe? The ardents could be relied upon, and they could fight too. But would that be too obvious? Well, first they had to actually get out of the palace. Kaladin grabbed his spear and turned to lead the way out, but his leg nearly betrayed him. He managed to catch himself, but it left him gasping in pain, clinging to his spear to keep from falling. Storms. Was that pool of blood at his feet his? He'd ripped his sutures out, and then some. "I was wrong," the king said. "We're both dead." "Fleet kept running," Kaladin growled, getting back under Elhokar's arm. "What?" "He couldn't win, but he kept running. And when the storm caught him, it didn't matter that he'd died, because he'd run for all he had." "Sure. All right." The king sounded groggy, though Kaladin couldn't tell if it was the alcohol or the blood loss. "We all die in the end, you see," Kaladin said. The two of them walked down the corridor, Kaladin leaning on his spear to keep them upright. "So I guess what truly matters is just how well you've run. And Elhokar, you've kept running since your father was killed, even if you screw up all the storming time." "Thank you?" the king said, drowsy. They reached an intersection, and Kaladin decided on escaping through the bowels of the palace complex, rather than the front gates. It was equally fast, but might not be the first place the plotters would look. The palace was empty. Moash had done as he'd said, sending the servants away into hiding, using the precedent of the Assassin in White's attack. It was a perfect plan. "Why?" the king whispered. "Shouldn't you hate me?" "I don't like you, Elhokar," Kaladin said. "But that doesn't mean it's right to let you die." "You said I should step down. Why, bridgeman? Why help me?" I don't know. They turned down a hallway, but only made it about halfway before the king stopped walking and slumped to the ground. Kaladin cursed, kneeling beside Elhokar, checking his pulse and the wound. This is the wine, Kaladin decided. That, plus the blood loss, left the king too lightheaded. Bad. Kaladin worked to rebind the wound as best he could, but then what? Try to pull the king out on a litter? Go for help, and risk leaving him alone? "Kaladin?" Kaladin froze, still kneeling over the king. "Kaladin, what are you doing?" Moash's voice demanded from behind. "We found the men at the door to the king's room. Storms, did you kill them?" Kaladin rose and turned, putting his weight on his good leg. Moash stood at the other end of the corridor, resplendent in his blue and red Shardplate. Another Shardbearer accompanied him, Blade up on the shoulder of his Plate, faceplate down. Graves. The assassins had arrived. Obviously they are fools The Desolation needs no usher It can and will sit where it wishes and the signs are obvious that the spren anticipate it doing so soon The Ancient of Stones must finally begin to crack It is a wonder that upon his will rested the prosperity and peace of a world for over four millennia From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Ceiling Rotation: pattern 1 Shallan stepped off the bridge onto a deserted plateau. The rain muffled the sounds of warfare, making the area feel even more isolated. Darkness like dusk. Rainfall like hushed whispers. This plateau was higher than most, so she could see Stormseat's center arrayed around her. Pillars with crem accreting at their bases, transforming them to stalagmites. Buildings that had become mounds, overgrown with stone like snow covering a fallen log. In the darkness and rain, the ancient city presented a sketch of skyline for the imagination to fill in. This city hid beneath time's own illusion. The others followed her across the bridge. They'd skirted the fighting on Aladar's battlefront, slipping along the Alethi lines to attain this farther plateau. Getting up here had taken time, as the bridgemen had needed to locate a usable landing. They'd had to climb a slope on the adjoining plateau and place their bridge there to get across the chasm. "How can you be sure this is the right place?" Renarin asked, clinking down onto the plateau beside her. Shallan had opted for an umbrella, but Renarin stood in the rain, helm under his arm, letting the water stream down his face. Didn't he wear spectacles? She hadn't seen them on him much lately. "It is the right place," Shallan said, "because it's deviant." "That's hardly a logical conclusion," Inadara said, joining the two of them as soldiers and bridgemen crossed to the empty plateau. "A portal of this nature would be kept hidden; it would not be deviant." "The Oathgates were not hidden," Shallan said. "That is beside the point, however. This plateau is a circle." "Many are circular." "Not this circular," Shallan said, striding forward. Now that she was here, she could see just how irregularly . . . well, regular the plateau was. "I was looking for a dais on a plateau, but didn't realize the scale of what I was searching for. This entire plateau is the dais upon which the Oathgate sat. "Don't you see? The other plateaus were created by some kind of disaster they are jagged, broken. This place is not. That's because it was already here when the shattering happened. On the old maps it was a raised section, like a giant pedestal. When the Plains were broken, it remained this way." "Yes . . ." Renarin said, nodding. "Imagine a plate with a circle etched into the center . . . if a force shattered the plate, it might break along the already weakened lines." "Leaving you with a bunch of irregular pieces," Shallan agreed, "and one shaped like a circle." "Perhaps," Inadara said. "But I find it odd that something so tactically important would be exposed." "The Oathgates were a symbol," Shallan said, continuing to walk. "The Vorin Right of Travel, given to all citizens of sufficient rank, is based on the Heralds' declaration that all borders should be open. If you were going to create a symbol of that unitya portal that connected all of the Silver Kingdoms together where would you put it? Hidden in a locked room? Or on a stage that rose above the city? It was out here because they were proud of it." They continued through the blowing rain. There was a hallowed quality to this place, and honestly, that was part of how she knew she was right. "Mmmm," Pattern said softly. "They are raising a storm." "The Voidspren?" Shallan whispered. "The bonded ones. They craft a storm." Right. Her task was urgent; she didn't have time to stand around thinking. She was about to order the search begun, but paused as she noticed Renarin staring westward, his eyes distant. "Prince Renarin?" she asked. "The wrong way," he whispered. "The wind is blowing from the wrong direction. West to east . . . Oh, Almighty above. It's terrible." She followed his gaze, but could see nothing. "It's actually real," Renarin said. "The Everstorm." "What are you talking about?" Shallan asked, feeling a chill at the tone of his voice. "I . . ." He looked to her and wiped the water from his eyes, gauntlet hanging from his waist. "I should be with my father. I should be able to fight. Only I'm useless." Great. He was creepy and whiny. "Well, your father ordered you to help me, so deal with your issues. Everyone, let's search this place." "What are we looking for, cousin?" asked Rock, one of the bridgemen. Cousin, she thought. Cute. Because of the red hair. "I don't know," she said. "Anything strange, out of the ordinary." They split up and spread out across the plateau. Along with Inadara, Shallan had a small group of ardents and scholars to help her, including one of Dalinar's stormwardens. She sent teams of several scholars, one bridgeman, and one soldier each in different directions. Renarin and the majority of the bridgemen insisted on going with her. She couldn't complain about thatthis was a war zone. Shallan passed a lump on the ground, part of a large ring. Perhaps once a low ornamental wall. How would this place have looked? She pictured it in her mind, and wished she could have drawn it. That would certainly have helped her visualize. Where would the portal be? Most likely at the center, so that was the direction she went. There she found a large stone mound. "This is all?" Rock asked. "He is just more rock." "That is exactly what I was hoping to find," Shallan said. "Anything exposed to the air would have weathered away or become immured with crem. If we're to discover anything useful, it will have to be inside." "Inside?" asked one of the bridgemen. "Inside what?" "The buildings," Shallan said, feeling at the wall until she found a ripple in the back of the rock. She turned to Renarin. "Prince Renarin, would you kindly slay this rock for me?" * * * Adolin raised his sphere in the dark chamber, shining light on the wall. After so long outdoors in the Weeping, it felt strange not to have rain tapping against his helm. The musty air in this place was already growing humid, and even with the shuffling of soldiers and men coughing, Adolin felt like it was too silent. Within this rocky tomb, they may as well have been miles away from the battlefield just outside. "How did you know, sir?" asked Skar, the bridgeman. "How'd you guess that this rock mound would be hollow?" "Because a clever woman," Adolin said, "once asked me to attack a boulder for her." Together, he and these men had circled to the other side of the large rock formation that the chanting Parshendi were using to guard their backs. With a few twists of the Shardblade, Adolin had cut an entrance into the mound, which had proven to be hollow as he'd hoped. He picked his way through the dusty chambers, passing bones and dried debris that might once have been furniture. Presumably it had rotted away before the crem had finished sealing the building. Had it been a kind of communal dwelling, long ago? Or perhaps a market? It did have a lot of rooms; many doorways still bore rusted hinges that had once held doors. A thousand men moved through the building with him, holding lanterns that carried large cut gemsfive times bigger than broams, though even some of those were starting to fail, as it had been so long since a highstorm. A thousand men was a large number to navigate through these eerie confines. But, unless he was completely off, they should now be approaching the opposite wallthe one just behind the Parshendi. Some of his men scouted nearby rooms, and came back with the confirmation. The building ended here. Adolin now saw the outlines of windows, sealed up with crem that had spilled in through gaps over the years, dribbling down the wall and piling on the floor. "All right," he called out to the company commanders and their captains. "Let's gather everyone we can in this room here and the hall right outside. I'll cut an exit hole. As soon as it's open, we need to spill out and attack those singing Parshendi. "First Company, you split to either side and secure this exit. Don't get pushed back! I'll charge and try to draw attention. Everyone else move through and join the assault as quickly as you can manage." The men nodded. Adolin took a deep breath, then closed his faceplate and stepped up to the wall. They were on the second floor of the building, but he estimated the buildup of crem outside would place that at about ground level. Indeed, from outside he heard a faint sound. Humming, resonating through the wall. Storms, the Parshendi were right there. He summoned his Blade, waited until the company commanders passed the word back that their men were ready, then hacked at the wall in several long ribbons. He sliced it the other way with sweeping blows, then slammed his Plate shoulder into it. The wall broke down and fell out, stone blocks cascading away from him. The rain returned in force. He was only a few feet off the ground, and he eagerly pushed his way out onto the slick wet rocks. Just to his left, Parshendi reserves stood in rows facing away from him, absorbed in their chanting. The clamor of battle was nearly inaudible here, all but drowned out by the spinetingling sound of that inhuman singing. Perfect. The rain and chanting had covered the noise of the hole opening. He hacked open another hole as men spilled out from the first one, bearing lights. He began to open a third exit, but heard a shout. One of the Parshendi had finally noticed him. She was femalewith this new form of theirs, that was more obvious than it had been before. He charged the short distance to the Parshendi and launched himself into their ranks, sweeping lethally with his Blade. Bodies fell dead with burned eyes. Five, then ten. His soldiers joined him, thrusting spears into the Parshendi, cutting off their awful song. It was shockingly easy. These Parshendi abandoned their song reluctantly, coming out of their trance disoriented and confused. Those who fought did so without coordination, and Adolin's swift attack didn't allow time for them to summon their strange sparking energy. It was like killing sleeping men. Adolin had done dirty work with his Shards before. Damnation, any time you took the field with Plate and Blade against ordinary men, you did dirty workslaughtering those who might as well have been children with sticks. This was worse though. Often they'd come to just before he killed themblinking to consciousness, shaking themselves awake, only to find themselves facetoface with a full Shardbearer in the rain, murdering their friends. Those looks of horror haunted Adolin as he sent corpse after corpse to the ground. Where was the Thrill that usually propelled him through this kind of butchery? He needed it. Instead, he felt only nausea. Standing amid a field of the newly deadthe acrid smoke of burnedout eyes curling up through the rain he trembled and dropped his Blade in disgust. It vanished to mist. Something crashed into him from behind. He lurched over a corpsestumbling but keeping his feetand spun about. A Shardblade smashed against his chest, spreading a glowing web of cracks across his breastplate. He deflected the next blow with his forearm and stepped back, taking a battle stance. She stood before him, rain streaming from her armor. What had she named herself? Eshonai. Inside his helm, Adolin grinned at the Shardbearer. This he could do. An honest fight. He raised his hands, the Shardblade forming from mist as he swung upward and deflected her attack in a sweeping parry. Thank you, he thought. * * * Dalinar rode Gallant back across the bridge from Roion's plateau, nursing a bloody wound at his side. Stupid. He should have seen that spear. He'd been too focused on that red lightning and the quickly shifting Parshendi fighting pairs. The truth, Dalinar thought, sliding from his horse so a surgeon could inspect the wound, is that you're an old man now. Perhaps not by the measuring of lifespans, as he was only in his fifties, but by the yardstick of soldiers he was certainly old. Without Shardplate to assist, he was getting slow, getting weak. Killing was a young man's game, if only because the old men fell first. That cursed rain kept coming, so he escaped it under one of Navani's pavilions. The archers kept the Parshendi from following across the chasm to harry Roion's beleaguered retreat. With the help of the bowmen, Dalinar had successfully saved the highprince's army, half of it at leastbut they'd lost the entire northern plateau. Roion rode across to safety, followed by an exhausted Captain Khal on footGeneral Khal's son wore his own Plate and bore Teleb's Blade, which he'd blessedly recovered from the corpse after the other man had fallen. They'd been forced to leave the body, and the Plate. Just as bad, the Parshendi singing continued unabated. Despite the soldiers saved, this was a terrible defeat. Dalinar undid his breastplate and sat down with a grunt as the surgeon ordered him a stool. He suffered the woman's ministration, though he knew the wound was not terrible. It was badany wound was bad on the battlefield, particularly if it impaired the sword armbut it wouldn't kill him. "Storms," the surgeon said. "Highprince, you're all scars under here. How many times have you been wounded in the shoulder?" "Can't remember." "How can you still use your arm?" "Training and practice." "That's not how it works . . ." she whispered, eyes wide. "I mean . . . storms . . ." "Just sew the thing up," he said. "Yes, I'll stay off the battlefield today. No, I won't stress it. Yes, I've heard all the lectures before." He shouldn't have been out there in the first place. He'd told himself he wouldn't ride into battle anymore. He was supposed to be a politician now, not a warlord. But once in a while, the Blackthorn needed to come out. The men needed it. Storms, he needed it. The Navani thundered into the tent. Too late. He sighed as she stalked up to him, passing this tent's fabrialwhich glowed on a little pedestal, collecting water around it in a shimmering globe. That water streamed off along two metal rods at the sides of the fabrial, spilling onto the ground, then running out of the tent and over the plateau's edge. He looked up at Navani grimly, expecting to be dressed down like a recruit who had forgotten his whetstone. Instead, she took him by his good side, then pulled him close. "No reprimand?" Dalinar asked. "We're at war," she whispered. "And we're losing, aren't we?" Dalinar glanced at the archers, who were running low on arrows. He didn't speak too loudly, lest they hear. "Yes." The surgeon glanced at him, then lowered her head and kept sewing. "You rode to battle when someone needed you," Navani said. "You saved the lives of a highprince and his soldiers. Why would you expect anger from me?" "Because you're you." He reached up with his good hand and ran his fingers through her hair. "Adolin has won his plateau," Navani said. "The Parshendi there are scattered and routed. Aladar holds. Roion has failed, but we're still evenly matched. So how are we losing? I can sense that we are, from your face, but I don't see it." "An even match is a loss for us," Dalinar said. He could feel it building. Distant, to the west. "If they complete that song, then as Rlain warned, that is the end." The surgeon finished as best she could, wrapping the wound and giving Dalinar leave to replace his shirt and coat, which would hold the bandage tight. Once dressed, he climbed to his feet, intending to go to the command tent and get an update on the situation from General Khal. He was interrupted as Roion burst into the pavilion. "Dalinar!" the tall, balding man rushed in, grabbing him by the arm. The bad one. Dalinar winced. "It's a storming bloodbath out there! We're dead. Storms, we're dead!" Nearby archers shuffled, their arrows spent. A sea of red eyes gathered on the plateau across the chasm, smoldering coals in the darkness. For all that Dalinar wanted to slap Roion, that wasn't the sort of thing you did to a highprince, even a hysterical one. Instead, he towed Roion out of the pavilion. The rainnow a fullblown stormfelt icy as it washed over his soaked uniform. "Control yourself, Brightlord," Dalinar said sternly. "Adolin has won his plateau. Not all is as bad as it seems." "It should not end this way," the Almighty said. Storm it! Dalinar shoved Roion away and strode out into the center of the plateau, looking up toward the sky. "Answer me! Let me know if you can hear me!" "I can." Finally. Some progress. "Are you the Almighty?" "I said I am not, child of Honor." "Then what are you?" I AM THAT WHICH BRINGS LIGHT AND DARKNESS. The voice took on more of a rumbling, distant quality. "The Stormfather," Dalinar said. "Are you a Herald?" NO. "Then are you a spren or a god?" BOTH. "What is the point of talking to me?" Dalinar shouted at the sky. "What is happening?" THEY CALL FOR A STORM. MY OPPOSITE. DEADLY. "How do we stop it?" YOU DON'T. "There has to be a way!" I BRING YOU A STORM OF CLEANSING. IT WILL CARRY AWAY YOUR CORPSES. THIS IS ALL I CAN DO. "No! Don't you dare abandon us!" YOU MAKE DEMANDS OF ME, YOUR GOD? "You aren't my god. You were never my god! You are a shadow, a lie!" Distant thunder rumbled ominously. The rain beat harder against Dalinar's face. I AM CALLED. I MUST GO. A DAUGHTER DISOBEYS. YOU WILL SEE NO FURTHER VISIONS, CHILD OF HONOR. THIS IS THE END. FAREWELL. "Stormfather!" Dalinar yelled. "There has to be a way! I will not die here!" Silence. Not even thunder. People had gathered around Dalinar: soldiers, scribes, messengers, Roion and Navani. Frightened people. "Don't abandon us," Dalinar said, voice trailing off. "Please . . ." * * * Moash stepped forward, his faceplate up, his face pained. "Kaladin?" "I had to make the choice that would let me sleep at night, Moash," Kaladin said wearily, standing before the unconscious form of the king. Blood pooled around Kaladin's boot from the wounds he'd reopened. Lightheaded, he had to lean on his spear to keep on his feet. "You said he was trustworthy," Graves said, turning toward Moash, his voice ringing inside his Shardplate helm. "You promised me, Moash!" "Kaladin is trustworthy," Moash said. It was just the three of themfour, if you counted the kingstanding in a lonely hallway of the palace. This would be a sad place to die. A place away from the wind. "He's just a little confused," Moash said, stepping forward. "This will still work. You didn't tell anyone, right, Kal?" I recognize this hallway, Kaladin realized. It's the very place we fought the Assassin in White. To his left, windows lined the wall, though shutters kept out the light rainfall. Yes . . . there. He spotted where planks had been installed over the hole that the assassin had cut through the wall. The place where Kaladin had fallen into blackness. Back here again. He took a deep breath and steadied himself as best he could on his good leg, then raised the spear, point toward Moash. Storms, his leg hurt. "Kal, the king is obviously wounded," Moash said. "We followed your trail of blood here. He's practically dead already." Trail of blood. Kaladin blinked bleary eyes. Of course. His thoughts were coming slowly. He should have caught that. Moash stopped a few feet from Kaladin, just out of easy striking range with the spear. "What are you going to do, Kal?" Moash demanded, looking at the spear pointed toward him. "Would you really attack a member of Bridge Four?" "You left Bridge Four the moment you turned against our duty," Kaladin whispered. "And you're different?" "No, I'm not," Kaladin said, feeling a hollowness in his stomach. "But I'm trying to change that." Moash took another step forward, but Kaladin pushed the spear point upward, toward Moash's face. His friend hesitated, raising his gauntleted hands in a warding gesture. Graves moved forward, but Moash shooed him away, then turned to Kaladin. "What do you think this will accomplish, Kal? If you get in our way, you'll just get yourself killed, and the king will still be dead. You want me to know you don't agree with this? Fine. You tried. Now you're overmatched, and there is no point in fighting. Put down the spear." Kaladin glanced over his shoulder. The king was still breathing. Moash's armor clinked. Kaladin turned back, raising the spear again. Storms . . . his head was really throbbing now. "I mean it, Kal," Moash said. "You'd attack me?" Kaladin said. "Your captain? Your friend?" "Don't turn this around on me." "Why not? Which is more important to you? Me or petty vengeance?" "He murdered them, Kaladin," Moash snapped. "That sorry excuse for a king killed the only family I ever had." "I know." "Then why are you protecting him?" "It wasn't his fault." "That's a load of" "It wasn't his fault," Kaladin said. "But I'd be here even if it had been, Moash! We have to be better than this, you and I. It's . . . I can't explain it, not perfectly. You have to trust me. Back down. The king hasn't yet seen you or Graves. We'll go to Dalinar, and I'll see that you get justice against the right man, Roshone, the one truly behind your grandparents' deaths. "But Moash, we're not going to be this kind of men. Murders in dark corridors, killing a drunk man because we find him distasteful, telling ourselves it's for the good of the kingdom. If I kill a man, I'm going to do it in the sunlight, and I'm going to do it only because there is no other way." Moash hesitated. Graves clinked up beside him, but again Moash raised a hand, stopping him. Moash met Kaladin's eyes, then shook his head. "Sorry, Kal. It's too late." "You won't have him. I won't back down." "I guess I wouldn't want you to." Moash slammed his faceplate down, the sides misting as it sealed. 11182510111271249151210101114102151171121011121713448311107151425 From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Ceiling Rotation: pattern 15 The stone block slid inward, confirming Shallan's deduction. They had opened a building that hadn't been entered, or even seen, for centuries. Renarin stepped back from the hole he'd made, giving Shallan a chance to step forward. The air from inside smelled stale, musty. Renarin dismissed his Blade, and oddly, as he did so, he let out a relieved sigh and relaxed against the outer wall of the building. Shallan moved to enter, but the bridgemen slipped in front of her to check the building's safety first, raising sapphire lanterns. The light revealed majesty. Shallan's breath caught in her throat. The large, circular room was a space worthy of a palace or temple. A mosaic mural covered the wall and floor with majestic images and dazzling color. Knights in armor stood before swirling skies of red and blue. People from all walks of life were depicted in all manner of settings, each crafted from vivid colors of every kind of stonea masterwork that brought the whole world into one room. Worried she'd damage the portal somehow, she'd placed Renarin's cuts near a ripple that she had hoped indicated a doorway, and it seemed that she'd been correct. She entered through the hole and walked a curving path through the circular chamber, silently counting the divisions in the floor mural. There were ten main ones, just as there had been ten orders of knights, ten kingdoms, ten peoples. And thenbetween the segments representing the first and tenth kingdomswas a narrower eleventh section. It depicted a tall tower. Urithiru. She'd found it, the portal. And this artwork! Such beauty. It was breathtaking. No, there wasn't time to admire art right now. The large floor mosaic swirled around the center, but the swords of each knight pointed toward the same area of the wall, so Shallan walked in that direction. Everything in here seemed perfectly preserved, even the lamps on the walls, which appeared to still hold dun gemstones. On the wall, she found a metal disc set into the stone. Was this steel? It hadn't rusted or even tarnished despite its long abandonment. "It's coming," Renarin announced from the other side of the room, his quiet voice echoing across the domed chamber. Storms, that boy was disturbing, particularly when accompanied by a howling storm and the sound of rain pelting the plateau outside. Brightness Inadara and several scholars arrived. Stepping into the chamber, they gasped and then began talking over one another as they rushed to examine the mural. Shallan studied the strange disc set into the wall. It was shaped like a tenpointed star and had a thin slot directly in the center. The Radiants could operate this place, she thought. And what did the Radiants have that nobody else did? Many things, but the shape of that slot in the metal gave her a pretty good guess why only they could make the Oathgate work. "Renarin, get over here," Shallan said. The boy clomped in her direction. "Shallan," Pattern said warningly. "Time is very short. They have summoned the Everstorm. And . . . and there's something else, coming from the other direction. A highstorm?" "It's the Weeping," Shallan said, looking to Pattern, who dimpled the wall just beside the steel disc. "No highstorms." "One is coming anyway. Shallan, they're going to hit together. Two storms coming, one from each direction. They will crash into each other right here." "I don't suppose they'll just, you know, cancel each other out?" "They will feed each other," Pattern said. "It will be like two waves hitting with their peaks coinciding . . . it will create a storm like none the world has ever seen. Stone will shatter, plateaus themselves might collapse. It's going to be bad. Very, very bad." Shallan looked to Inadara, who had walked up beside her. "Thoughts?" "I don't know what to think, Brightness," Inadara said. "You were right about this place. I . . . I no longer trust myself to judge what is correct and what is false." "We need to move the armies to this plateau," Shallan said. "Even if they defeat the Parshendi, they're doomed unless we can make this portal work." "It doesn't look like a portal at all," Inadara said. "What will it do? Open a doorway in the wall?" "I don't know," Shallan said, looking to Renarin. "Summon your Shardblade." He did so, wincing as it appeared. Shallan pointed at the slot like a keyhole in the wallacting on a hunch. "See if you can scratch that metal with your Blade. Be very careful. We don't want to ruin the Oathgate, in case I'm wrong." Renarin stepped up and carefullyusing his hand to pinch the weapon from aboveplaced the tip of the blade on the metal around the keyhole. He grunted as the Blade wouldn't cut. He tried a little harder, and the metal resisted the Blade. "Made of the same stuff!" Shallan said, growing excited. "And that slot is shaped like it might fit a Blade. Try sliding the weapon in, very slowly." He did so, and as the point moved into the hole, the entire shape of the keyhole shifted, the metal flowing to match the shape of Renarin's Shardblade. It was working! He got the weapon placed, and they turned around, looking over the chamber. Nothing appeared to have changed. "Did that do anything?" Renarin asked. "It has to have," Shallan said. They'd unlocked a door, perhaps. But how to turn the equivalent of the doorknob? "We need Highlady Navani to help," Shallan said. "More importantly, we need to bring everyone here. Go, soldiers, bridgemen! Run and tell Dalinar to gather his armies on this plateau. Tell him that if he doesn't, they are doomed. The rest of you scholars, we're going to put our heads together and figure out how this storming thing works." * * * Adolin danced through the storm, trading blows with Eshonai. She was good, though she didn't use stances he recognized. She dodged back and forth, feeling him out with her Blade, bursting through the storm like a crackling thunderbolt. Adolin kept after her, sweeping with his Shardblade, forcing her away. A duel. He could win a duel. Even in the middle of a storm, even against a monster, this was something he could do. He backed her away across the battlefield, closer to where his armies had crossed the chasm to join this battle. She was difficult to maneuver. He had only met this Eshonai twice, but he felt he knew her through the way she fought. He sensed her eagerness for blood. Her eagerness to kill. The Thrill. He did not feel it himself. He sensed it in her. Around him, Parshendi fled or fought in pockets as his men harried them. He passed a Parshendi, forced to the ground by soldiers, being gutted in the rain as he tried to crawl away. Water and blood splashed on the plateau, frantic yells sounding amid the thunder. Thunder. Distant thunder from the west. Adolin glanced in that direction, and nearly lost his concentration. He could see it building, wind and rain spinning in a gigantic pillar, flashing red. Eshonai swung for him, and Adolin turned back, blocking the blow with his forearm. That section of his Plate was getting weak, the cracks leaking Stormlight. He stepped into the blow and swung his own Blade, onehanded, into Eshonai's side. He was rewarded by a grunt. She didn't fold, though. She didn't even step back. She raised her Blade and smashed it down against his forearm yet again. The Plate there exploded in a flash of light and molten metal. Storms. Adolin was forced to pull the arm back and release the gauntletnow too heavy, without the connecting Plate to help itletting it drop off his hand. The wind that blew against his exposed skin was startlingly powerful. A little more, Adolin thought, not backing away despite the lost section of Plate. He grabbed his Shardblade in two handsone metal, the other fleshand battered forward with a series of strikes. He transitioned out of Windstance. No sweeping majesty for him. He needed the frantic fury of Flamestance. Not just for the power, but because of what he needed to convey to Eshonai. Eshonai growled, forced backward. "Your day has ended, destroyer," she said inside her helm. "Today, your brutality turns against you. Today, extinction turns from us to you." A little more. Adolin pressed her with a burst of swordplay, then he flagged, presenting her with an opening. She took it immediately, swinging for his helm, which leaked from an earlier blow. Yes, she was fully caught up in the Thrill. That lent her energy and strength, but it drove her to recklessness. To ignore her surroundings. Adolin took the hit to the head and stumbled. Eshonai laughed with glee and moved to swing again. Adolin lunged forward and slammed his shoulder and head into her chest. His helm exploded from the force of it, but his gambit succeeded. Eshonai had not noticed how close they were to the chasm. His shove threw her over the plateau's edge. He felt Eshonai's panic, heard her shout, as she was dropped into the open blackness. Unfortunately, the exploding helm left Adolin momentarily blinded. He stumbled, and when he put a foot down, it landed only on empty air. He lurched, then fell toward the void of the chasm. For a timeless moment, all he felt was panic and fright, a frozen eternity before he realized he wasn't falling. His vision cleared, and he looked down into the maw before him, rain falling in curtains all around. Then he looked back over his shoulder. To where two bridgemen had grabbed hold of the steel link skirt of his Plate and were struggling to hold him back from the brink. Grunting, they clung to the slick metal, holding tight with feet thrust against stones to keep from being pulled off with him. Other soldiers materialized, rushing to help. Hands grabbed Adolin around the waist and shoulders, and together they hauled him back from the brink of the voidto the point that he was able to get his balance again and stumble away from the chasm. Soldiers cheered, and Adolin let out an exhausted laugh. He turned to the bridgemen, Skar and Drehy. "I guess," Adolin said, "I don't need to wonder if you two can keep up with me or not." "This was nothing," Skar said. "Yeah," Drehy added. "Lifting fat lighteyes is easy. You should try a bridge sometime." Adolin grinned, then wiped water from his face with his exposed hand. "See if you can find a chunk of my helm or forearm piece. Regrowing the armor will go faster if we've got a seed. Collect my gauntlet too, if you would." The two nodded. That red lightning in the sky was building, and that spinning column of dark rain was expanding, growing outward. That . . . that did not seem like a good sign. He needed a better grasp on what was happening in the rest of the army. He jogged across the bridge to the central plateau. Where was his father? What was happening on Aladar's and Roion's fronts? Had Shallan returned from her expedition? Everything seemed chaotic here on the central plateau. The rising winds tore at tents, and some of them had collapsed. People ran this way and that. Adolin spotted a figure in a thick cloak, striding purposefully through the rain. That person looked like he knew what he was doing. Adolin caught his arm as he passed. "Where's my father?" he asked. "What orders are you delivering?" The hood of the cloak fell down and the man turned to regard Adolin with eyes that were slightly too large, too rounded. A bald head. Filmy, loose clothing beneath the cloak. The Assassin in White. * * * Moash stepped forward, but did not summon his Shardblade. Kaladin struck with his spear, but it was futile. He'd used what strength he had to merely remain upright. His spear glanced off Moash's helm, and the former bridgeman slapped a fist down on the weapon, shattering the wood. Kaladin lurched to a stop, but Moash wasn't done. He stepped forward and slammed an armored fist into Kaladin's gut. Kaladin gasped, folding as things broke inside of him. Ribs snapped like twigs before that impossibly strong fist. Kaladin coughed, spraying blood across Moash's armor, then groaned as his friend stepped back, removing his fist. Kaladin collapsed to the cold stone floor, everything shaking. His eyes felt like they'd pop from his face, and he curled around his broken chest, trembling. "Storms." Moash's voice was distant. "That was a harder blow than I intended." "You did what you had to." Graves. Oh . . . Stormfather . . . the pain . . . "Now what?" Moash. "We end this. Kill the king with a Shardblade. It will still look like the assassin, hopefully. Those blood trails are frustrating. They might make people ask questions. Here, let me cut down these boards, so it looks like he came in through the wall, like last time." Cold air. Rain. Yelling? Very distant? He knew that voice. . . . "Syl?" Kaladin whispered, blood on his lips. "Syl?" Nothing. "I ran until . . . until I couldn't any longer," Kaladin whispered. "End of . . . the race." Life before death. "I will do it." Graves. "I will bear this burden." "It is my right!" Moash said. He blinked, eyes resting on the king's unconscious body just beside him. Still breathing. I will protect those who cannot protect themselves. It made sense, now, why he'd had to make this choice. Kaladin rolled to his knees. Graves and Moash were arguing. "I have to protect him," Kaladin whispered. Why? "If I protect . . ." He coughed. "If I protect . . . only the people I like, it means that I don't care about doing what is right." If he did that, he only cared about what was convenient for himself. That wasn't protecting. That was selfishness. Straining, agonized, Kaladin raised one foot. The good foot. Coughing blood, he shoved himself upward and stumbled to his feet between Elhokar and the assassins. Fingers trembling, he felt at his belt, andafter two triesgot his side knife out. He squeezed out tears of pain, and through blurry vision, saw the two Shardbearers looking at him. Moash slowly raised his faceplate, revealing a stunned expression. "Stormfather . . . Kal, how are you standing?" It made sense now. That was why he'd come back. It was about Tien, it was about Dalinar, and it was about what was rightbut most of all, it was about protecting people. This was the man he wanted to be. Kaladin moved one foot back, touching his heel to the king, forming a battle stance. Then raised his hand before him, knife out. His hand shook like a roof rattling from thunder. He met Moash's eyes. Strength before weakness. "You. Will. Not. Have. Him." "Finish this, Moash," Graves said. "Storms," Moash said. "There's no need. Look at him. He can't fight back." Kaladin felt exhausted. At least he'd stood up. It was the end. The journey had come and gone. Shouting. Kaladin heard it now, as if it were closer. He is mine! a feminine voice said. I claim him. HE BETRAYED HIS OATH. "He has seen too much," Graves said to Moash. "If he lives this day, he'll betray us. You know my words are true, Moash. Kill him." The knife slipped from Kaladin's fingers, clanging to the ground. He was too weak to hold it. His arm flopped back to his side, and he stared down at the knife, dazed. I don't care. HE WILL KILL YOU. "I'm sorry, Kal," Moash said, stepping forward. "I should have made it quick at the start." The Words, Kaladin. That was Syl's voice. You have to speak the Words! I FORBID THIS. YOUR WILL MATTERS NOT! Syl shouted. YOU CANNOT HOLD ME BACK IF HE SPEAKS THE WORDS! THE WORDS, KALADIN! SAY THEM! "I will protect even those I hate," Kaladin whispered through bloody lips. "So long as it is right." A Shardblade appeared in Moash's hands. A distant rumbling. Thunder. THE WORDS ARE ACCEPTED, the Stormfather said reluctantly. "Kaladin!" Syl's voice. "Stretch forth thy hand!" She zipped around him, suddenly visible as a ribbon of light. "I can't . . ." Kaladin said, drained. "Stretch forth thy hand!" He reached out a trembling hand. Moash hesitated. Wind blew in the opening in the wall, and Syl's ribbon of light became mist, a form she often took. Silver mist, which grew larger, coalesced before Kaladin, extending into his hand. Glowing, brilliant, a Shardblade emerged from the mist, vivid blue light shining from swirling patterns along its length. Kaladin gasped a deep breath as if coming fully awake for the first time. The entire hallway went black as the Stormlight in every lamp down the length of the hall winked out. For a moment, they stood in darkness. Then Kaladin exploded with Light. It erupted from his body, making him shine like a blazing white sun in the darkness. Moash backed away, face pale in the white brilliance, throwing up a hand to shade his eyes. Pain evaporated like mist on a hot day. Kaladin's grip firmed upon the glowing Shardblade, a weapon beside which those of Graves and Moash looked dull. One after another, shutters burst open up and down the hallway, wind screaming into the corridor. Behind Kaladin, frost crystalized on the ground, growing backward away from him. A glyph formed in the frost, almost in the shape of wings. Graves screamed, falling in his haste to get away. Moash backed up, staring at Kaladin. "The Knights Radiant," Kaladin said softly, "have returned." "Too late!" Graves shouted. Kaladin frowned, then glanced at the king. "The Diagram spoke of this," Graves said, scuttling back along the corridor. "We missed it. We missed it completely! We focused on making certain you were separated from Dalinar, and not on what our actions might push you to become!" Moash looked from Graves back at Kaladin. Then he ran, Plate clinking as he turned and dashed down the corridor and disappeared. Kaladin, Syl's voice spoke in his head. Something is still very wrong. I feel it on the winds. Graves laughed like a madman. "Separating me," Kaladin whispered. "From Dalinar? Why would they care?" He turned, looking eastward. Oh no . . . But who is the wanderer, the wild piece, the one who makes no sense? I glimpse at his implications, and the world opens to me. I shy back. Impossible. Is it? From the Diagram, West Wall Psalm of Wonders: paragraph 8 (Note by Adrotagia: Could this refer to Mraize?) "She didn't say if she could even open the pathway?" Dalinar asked as he stalked toward the command tent. Rain pummeled the ground around him, so dense that it was no longer possible to distinguish separate windblown sheets in the glare of Navani's fabrial floodlights. It was long past when he should have found cover. "No, Brightlord," said Peet, the bridgeman. "But she was insistent that we couldn't face what was coming at us. Two highstorms." "How could there be two?" Navani asked. She wore a stout cloak but was soaked clear through anyway, her umbrella having blown away long ago. Roion walked on Dalinar's other side, his beard and mustache limp with water. "I don't know, Brightness," Peet said. "But that's what she said. A highstorm and something else. She called it an Everstorm. She expects they're going to collide right here." Dalinar considered, frowning. The command tent was just ahead. Inside, he'd talk to his field commanders, and The command tent shuddered, then ripped free in a burst of wind. Trailing ropes and spikes, it blew right past Dalinar, almost close enough to touch. Dalinar cursed as the light of a dozen lanternsonce contained in the tent spilled onto the plateau. Scribes and soldiers scrambled, trying to grab maps and sheets of paper as rain and wind claimed them. "Storm it!" Dalinar said, turning his back to the powerful wind. "I need an update!" "Sir!" Commander Cael, head of the field command, jogged over, his wife Aparafollowing. Cael's clothing was mostly dry, though that was quickly changing. "Aladar has won his plateau! Apara was just composing you a message." "Really?" Almighty bless that man. He'd done it. "Yes, sir," Cael said. He had to shout against the wind and rain. "Highprince Aladar said the singing Parshendi went right down, letting him slaughter them. The rest broke and fled. Even with Roion's plateau fallen, we've won the day!" "Doesn't feel like it," Dalinar shouted back. Just minutes ago, the rainfall had been light. The situation was degrading quickly. "Send orders immediately to Aladar, my son, and General Khal. There's a plateau just to the southeast, perfectly round. I want all of our forces to move there to brace for an oncoming storm." "Yes, sir!" Cael said with a salute, fist to coat. With the other hand, however, he pointed over Dalinar's shoulder. "Sir, have you seen that?" He turned, looking back toward the west. Red light flashed, lightning coursing down in repeated blasts. The sky itself seemed to spasm as something built there, swirling in an enormous storm cell that was rapidly expanding outward. "Almighty above . . ." Navani whispered. Nearby another tent shook, its stakes coming undone. "Leave the tents, Cael," Dalinar said. "Get everyone moving. Now. Navani, go to Brightness Shallan. Help her if you can." The officer leaped away and began shouting orders. Navani went with him, vanishing into the night, and a squad of soldiers chased after her to provide protection. "And me, Dalinar?" Roion asked. "We'll need you to take command of your men and lead them to safety," Dalinar said. "If such a thing can be found." That tent nearby shook again. Dalinar frowned. It didn't seem to be moving along with the wind. And was that . . . shouting? Adolin crashed through the tent's fabric and skidded along the stones on his back, his armor leaking Light. "Adolin!" Dalinar shouted, dashing to his son. The young man was missing several segments of his armor. He looked up with gritted teeth, blood streaming from his nose. He said something, but it was lost to the wind. No helm, no left vambrace, the breastplate cracked just short of shattering, his right leg exposed. Who could have done such a thing to a Shardbearer? Dalinar knew the answer immediately. He cradled Adolin, but looked up past the collapsed tent. It whipped in the storm and tore away as a man strode past it, glowing with spinning trails of Stormlight. Those foreign features, clothing all of white plastered to his body by the rain, a bowed, hairless head, shadows hiding eyes that glowed with Stormlight. Gavilar's murderer. Szeth, the Assassin in White. * * * Shallan worked through the inscriptions on the wall of the round chamber, frantically searching for some way to make the Oathgate function. This had to work. It had to. "This is all in the Dawnchant," Inadara said. "I can't make sense of any of it." The Knights Radiant are the key. Shouldn't Renarin's sword have been enough? "What's the pattern?" she whispered. "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. "Perhaps you cannot see it because you are too close? Like the Shattered Plains?" Shallan hesitated, then stood and walked to the center of the room, where the depictions of the Knights Radiant and their kingdoms met at a central point. "Brightlord Renarin?" Inadara asked. "Is something wrong?" The young prince had fallen to his knees and was huddled next to the wall. "I can see it," Renarin answered feverishly, his voice echoing in the chamber. Ardents who had been studying part of the murals looked up at him. "I can see the future itself. Why? Why, Almighty? Why have you cursed me so?" He screamed a pleading cry, then stood and cracked something against the wall. A rock? Where had he gotten it? He gripped the thing in a gauntleted hand and began to write. Shocked, Shallan took a step toward him. A sequence of numbers? All zeros. "It's come," Renarin whispered. "It's come, it's come, it's come. We're dead. We're dead. We're dead. . . ." * * * Dalinar knelt beneath a fracturing sky, holding his son. Rainwater washed the blood from Adolin's face, and the boy blinked, dazed from his thrashing. "Father . . ." Adolin said. The assassin stepped forward quietly, with no apparent urgency. The man seemed to glide through the rain. "When you take the princedom, son," Dalinar said, "don't let them corrupt you. Don't play their games. Lead. Don't follow." "Father!" Adolin said, his eyes focusing. Dalinar stood up. Adolin lurched over onto all fours and tried to get to his feet, but the assassin had broken one of Adolin's greaves, which made it almost impossible to rise. The boy slipped back into the pooling water. "You've been taught well, Adolin," Dalinar said, eyes on that assassin. "You're a better man than I am. I was always a tyrant who had to learn to be something else. But you, you've been a good man from the start. Lead them, Adolin. Unite them." "Father!" Dalinar walked away from Adolin. Nearby, scribes and attendants, captains and enlisted men all shouted and scrambled, trying to find order in the chaos of the storm. They followed Dalinar's order to evacuate, and most had yet to notice the figure in white. The assassin stopped ten paces from Dalinar. Roion, palefaced and stammering, backed away from the two of them and began shouting. "Assassin! Assassin!" The rainfall was actually letting up a little. That didn't bring Dalinar much hope; not with that red lightning on the horizon. Was that . . . a stormwall building at the front of the new storm? His efforts to disrupt the Parshendi had fallen short. The Shin man didn't strike. He stood opposite Dalinar, motionless, expressionless, water dripping down his face. Unnaturally calm. Dalinar was far taller and broader. This small man in white, with his pale skin, seemed almost a youth, a stripling by comparison. Behind him, Roion's cries were lost in the confusion. However, Bridge Four did run up to surround Dalinar, spears in hand. Dalinar waved them back. "There's nothing you can do here, lads," Dalinar said. "Let me face him." Ten heartbeats. "Why?" Dalinar asked the assassin, who still stood there in the rain. "Why kill my brother? Did they explain the reasoning behind your orders?" "I am SzethsonsonVallano," the man said. Harshly. "Truthless of Shinovar. I do as my masters demand, and I do not ask for explanations." Dalinar revised his assessment. This man was not calm. He seemed that way, but when he spoke, he did it through clenched teeth, his eyes open too wide. He's mad, Dalinar thought. Storms. "You don't have to do this," Dalinar said. "If it's about pay . . ." "What I am owed," the assassin shouted, rainwater spraying from his face and Stormlight rising from his lips, "will come to me eventually! Every bit of it. I will drown in it, stonewalker!" Szeth put his hand to the side, Shardblade appearing. Then, with a curt, deprecatory motionlike he was merely trimming a bit of gristle from his meat he strode forward and swung at Dalinar. Dalinar caught the Blade with his own, which appeared in his hand as he raised it. The assassin spared a glance for Dalinar's weapon, then smiled, lips drawn thin, showing only a hint of teeth. That eager smile matched with haunted eyes was one of the most evil things Dalinar had ever seen. "Thank you," the assassin said, "for extending my agony by not dying easily." He stepped back and burst afire with white light. He came at Dalinar again, inhumanly quick. * * * Adolin cursed, shaking out of his daze. Storms, his head hurt. He'd smacked it something good when the assassin tossed him to the ground. Father was fighting Szeth. Bless the man for listening to reason and bonding that madman's Blade. Adolin gritted his teeth and struggled to get to his feet, something that was difficult with a broken greave. Though the rain was letting up, the sky remained dark. To the west, lightning plunged downward like red waterfalls, almost constant. At the same time, wind gusted from the east. Something was building out there too, from the Origin. This was very bad. Those things Father said to me . . . Adolin stumbled, almost falling to the ground, but hands appeared to assist him. He glanced to the side to find those two bridgemen from before, Skar and Drehy, helping him to his feet. "You two," Adolin said, "are getting a storming raise. Help me get this armor off." He frantically began removing sections of armor. The entire suit was so battered it was nearly useless. Metal clanged nearby as Dalinar fought. If he could hold a little longer, Adolin would be able to help. He would not let that creature get the better of him again. Not again! He spared a glance for what Dalinar was doing, and froze, hands on the straps for his breastplate. His father . . . his father moved beautifully. * * * Dalinar did not fight for his life. His life hadn't been his own for years. He fought for Gavilar. He fought as he wished he had all those years ago, for the chance he had missed. In that moment between stormswhen the rain stilled and the winds drew in their breaths to blowhe danced with the slayer of kings, and somehow held his own. The assassin moved like a shadow. His step seemed too quick to be human. When he jumped, he soared into the air. He swung his Shardblade like flashes of lightning, and would occasionally stretch forward with his other hand, as if to grab Dalinar. Recalling their previous encounter, Dalinar recognized that as the more dangerous of Szeth's weapons. Each time, Dalinar managed to bring his Blade around and force the assassin away. The man attacked from different directions, but Dalinar didn't think. Thoughts could get jumbled, the mind disoriented. His instincts knew what to do. Duck when Szeth leaped over Dalinar's head. Step backward, avoiding a strike that should have severed his spine. Lash out, forcing the assassin away. Three quick steps backward, sword up wardingly, strike for the assassin's palm as it tried to touch him. It worked. For this brief time, he fought this creature. Bridge Four remained back, as he'd commanded. They'd only have interfered. He survived. But he did not win. Finally, Dalinar twisted away from a strike but was unable to move quickly enough. The assassin rounded on him and thrust a fist into his side. Dalinar's ribs cracked. He grunted, stumbling, almost falling. He swung his Blade toward Szeth, warding the man back, but it didn't matter. The damage was done. He sank to his knees, barely able to remain upright for the pain. In that instant he knew a truth he should always have known. If I'd been there, on that night, awake instead of drunk and asleep . . . Gavilar would still have died. I couldn't have beaten this creature. I can't do it now, and I couldn't have done it then. I couldn't have saved him. It brought peace, and Dalinar finally set down that boulder, the one he'd been carrying for over six years. The assassin stalked toward him, glowing with terrible Stormlight, but a figure lunged for him from behind. Dalinar expected it to be Adolin, perhaps one of the bridgemen. Instead, it was Roion. * * * Adolin tossed aside the last bit of armor and went running for his father. He wasn't too late. Dalinar knelt before the assassin, defeated, but not dead. Adolin shouted, drawing close, and an unexpected figure leapt out of the wreckage of a tent. Highprince Roionincongruously holding a side sword and leading a small force of soldiersrushed the assassin. Rats had a better chance fighting a chasmfiend. Adolin barely had time to shout as the assassinmoving at blinding speed spun and cut the blade from the hilt of Roion's sword. Szeth's hand shot out and slammed against Roion's chest. Roion shot into the air, trailing a wisp of Stormlight. He screamed as the sky swallowed him. He lasted longer than his men. The assassin swept between them, deftly avoiding spears, moving with uncanny grace. A dozen soldiers fell in an instant, eyes burning. Adolin jumped over one of the bodies as it collapsed. Storms. He could still hear Roion screaming up above somewhere. Adolin thrust at the assassin, but the creature twisted and slapped the Shardblade away. The assassin was grinning. He didn't speak, though Stormlight leaked between his teeth. Adolin tried Smokestance, attacking with a quick sequence of jabs. The assassin silently battered them away, unfazed. Adolin focused, dueling the best he could, but he was a child before this thing. Roion, still screaming, plummeted from the sky and hit nearby with a sickening wet crunch. A quick glance at his corpse told Adolin that the highprince would never rise again. Adolin cursed and lunged for the assassin, but a fluttering tarpbrushed by the assassin in passingleaped toward Adolin. The monster could command inanimate objects! Adolin sliced through the tarp and then jumped forward to swing for the assassin. He found nothing to fight. Duck. He threw himself to the ground as something passed over his head, the assassin flying through the air. Szeth's hissing Shardblade missed Adolin's head by inches. Adolin rolled and came to his knees, puffing. How . . . What could he do . . . ? You can't beat it, Adolin thought. Nothing can beat it. The assassin landed lightly. Adolin climbed back to his feet, and found himself in company. A dozen of the bridgemen formed up around him. Skar, at their head, looked to Adolin and nodded. Good men. They'd seen Roion's fall, and still they joined him. Adolin hefted his Shardblade and noticed that a short distance away, his father had managed to regain his feet. Another small group of bridgemen moved in around him, and he allowed it. He and Adolin had dueled and lost. Their only chance now was a mad rush. Nearby, shouts arose. General Khal and a large strike force of soldiers, judging by the banner approaching. There wasn't time. The assassin stood on the wet plateau between Dalinar's small troop and Adolin's, head bowed. Fallen blue lanterns gave light. The sky had gone as black as night, except when broken by that red lightning. Charge and mob a Shardbearer. Hope for a lucky blow. It was the only way. Adolin nodded to Dalinar. His father nodded back, grim. He knew. He knew there was no beating this thing. Lead them, Adolin. Unite them. Adolin screamed, charging forward, sword out, men running with him. Dalinar advanced too, more slowly, one arm across his chest. Storms, the man could barely walk. Szeth snapped his head up, face devoid of all emotion. As they arrived, he leaped, shooting into the air. Adolin's eyes followed him up. Surely they hadn't chased him off . . . The assassin twisted in the air, then crashed back down to the ground, glowing like a comet. Adolin barely parried a blow from the Blade; the force of it was incredible. It tossed him backward. The assassin spun, and a pair of bridgemen fell with burning eyes. Others lost spearheads as they tried to stab at him. The assassin ripped free from the press of bodies, trailing blood from a couple of wounds. Those wounds closed as Adolin watched, the blood stopping. It was as Kaladin had said. With a horrible sinking feeling, Adolin realized just how little a chance they'd ever had. The assassin dashed for Dalinar, who brought up the rear of the attack. The aging soldier raised his Blade, as if in respect, then thrust once. An attack. That was the way to go. "Father . . ." Adolin whispered. The assassin parried the thrust, then placed his hand against Dalinar's chest. The highprince, suddenly glowing, lurched up into the dark sky. He didn't scream. The plateau fell silent. Some bridgemen propped up wounded fellows. Others turned toward the assassin, pulling into a spear formation, looking frantic. The assassin lowered his Blade, then started to walk away. "Bastard!" Adolin spat, dashing after him. "Bastard!" He could barely see for the tears. The assassin stopped, then leveled his weapon toward Adolin. Adolin stumbled to a halt. Storms, his head hurt. "It is finished," the assassin whispered. "I am done." He turned from Adolin and continued to walk away. Like Damnation itself, you are! Adolin raised his Shardblade overhead. The assassin spun and slapped the weapon so hard with his own Blade that Adolin distinctly heard something snap in his wrist. His Blade tumbled from his fingers, vanishing. The assassin's hand slapped out, knuckles striking Adolin in the chest, and he gasped, his breath suddenly gone from his throat. Stunned, he sank to his knees. "I suppose," the assassin snarled, "I can kill one more, on my own time." Then he grinned, a terrible smile with teeth clenched, eyes wide. As if he were in enormous pain. Gasping, Adolin awaited the blow. He looked toward the sky. Father, I'm sorry. I . . . I . . . What was that? He blinked as he made out something glowing in the air, drifting down, like a leaf. A figure. A man. Dalinar. The highprince fell slowly, as if he were no more weighty than a cloud. White Light streamed from his body in glowing wisps. Nearby bridgemen murmured, soldiers shouted, pointing. Adolin blinked, certain he was delusional. But no, that was Dalinar. Like . . . one of the Heralds themselves, coming down from the Tranquiline Halls. The assassin looked, then stumbled back, mouth open in horror. "No . . . No!" And then, like a falling star, a blazing fireball of light and motion shot down in front of Dalinar. It crashed into the ground, sending out a ring of Stormlight like white smoke. At the center, a figure in blue crouched with one hand on the stones, the other clutching a glowing Shardblade. His eyes afire with a light that somehow made the assassin's seem dull by comparison, he wore the uniform of a bridgeman, and bore the glyphs of slavery on his forehead. The expanding ring of smoky light faded, save for a large glypha swordlike shapewhich remained for a brief moment before puffing away. "You sent him to the sky to die, assassin," Kaladin said, Stormlight puffing from his lips, "but the sky and the winds are mine. I claim them, as I now claim your life." One is almost certainly a traitor to the others. From the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk Drawer: paragraph 27 Kaladin let the Stormlight evaporate before him. He was running lowhis frantic flight across the Plains had drained him. How shocked he had been when the flare of light rising into the darkening sky above a lit plateau had turned out to be Dalinar himself. Lashed to the sky by Szeth. Kaladin had caught him quickly and sent him back to the ground with a careful Lashing of his own. Ahead, Szeth stumbled away from the princeling, holding out his sword wardingly toward Kaladin, eyes wide and lips trembling. Szeth looked horrified. Good. Dalinar finally landed on the plateau with a soft step, and Kaladin's Lashing ran out. "Seek shelter," Kaladin said, the tempest in his veins dampening further. "I flew over a storm on my way here . . . a big one. Coming from the west." "We're in the process of withdrawing." "Hurry," Kaladin said. "I will deal with our friend." "Kaladin?" Kaladin turned, glancing at the highprince, who stood tall, despite cradling one arm against his chest. Dalinar met his eyes. "You are what I've been looking for." "Yes. Finally." Kaladin turned and strode toward the assassin. He passed Bridge Four in a tight formation, and the menat a barked command from Teftthrew something down before Kaladin. Blue lanterns, lit by oversized gems that had lasted the Weeping. Bless them. Stormlight streamed up as he passed, filling him. With a sinking feeling, however, he noticed two corpses with burnedout eyes at their feet. Pedin and Mart. Eth clutched his brother's body, weeping. Other bridgemen had lost limbs. Kaladin snarled. No more. He would lose no further men to this monster. "You ready?" he whispered. Of course, Syl said in his head. I'm not the one we've been waiting on. Burning with Stormlight, enraged and alight, Kaladin launched himself at the assassin and met him Blade against Blade. * * * "We're dead . . ." Renarin muttered. "Someone shut him up," Shallan snapped. "Gag him if you have to." She pointedly turned around, ignoring the raving prince. She still stood in the center of the muraled chamber. The pattern. What was the pattern? A circular room. A thing on one side that adapted to fit different Shardblades. Depictions of Knights on the floor, glowing with Stormlight, pointing at a tower city, just as the myths described. Ten lamps on the walls. The lock hung over what she thought was a depiction of Natanatan, the kingdom of the Shattered Plains. It Ten lamps. With gems in them. Latticework of metal enclosing each one. Shallan blinked, a shock running through her. "It's a fabrial." * * * The assassin hurtled into the air. Captain Kaladin flew upward, chasing him, trailing Light. "Status of the retreat!" Dalinar bellowed, crossing the plateau, his ribs smarting like nothing else, his wound from before little better. Storms. That one had faded as he fought, but now it ached something fierce. "Someone get me information!" Scribes and ardents appeared from the nearby wreckage of tents. Shouts rose from around the plateau. The wind started to pick uptheir period of reprieve, the short calm, was over. They needed to escape these plateaus. Now. Dalinar reached Adolin and helped the young man to his feet. He looked quite a bit worse for wear, bruised, battered, dizzy. He flexed his right hand and winced in pain, then gingerly let it relax. "Damnation," Adolin said. "That bridgeboy is really one of them? The Knights Radiant?" "Yes." Oddly, Adolin smiled, seeming satisfied. "Ha! I knew there was something wrong with that man." "Go," Dalinar said, pushing Adolin along. "We need to get the army to move two plateaus over, that direction, where Shallan waits. Get over there and organize what you can." He looked westward as the wind whipped up further, with bursts of rain. "Time is short." Adolin shouted for the bridgemen to join him, which they did, helping their woundedthough they were unfortunately forced to leave their dead. Several of them carried Adolin's Shardplate as well, which was apparently spent. Dalinar limped eastward across the plateau as fast as he could manage in his condition, searching for . . . Yes. The place where he'd left Gallant. The horse snorted, shaking a wet mane. "Bless you, old friend," Dalinar said, reaching the Ryshadium. Through the thunder and the chaos, the horse had not fled. Dalinar moved much more easily once in the saddle, and eventually found Roion's army pouring southward toward Shallan's plateau, in organized ranks. He allowed himself a sigh of relief at their orderly march; the majority of the army had already crossed to the southern plateau, only one away from Shallan's round one. That was wonderful. He couldn't remember where Captain Khal had been sent, but with Roion himself fallen, Dalinar had assumed he'd left this army in chaos. "Dalinar!" a voice called. He turned to find the utterly incongruous sight of Sebarial and his mistress sitting beneath a canopy, eating dried sellafruit off a plate held by an awkwardlooking soldier. Sebarial raised a cup of wine toward Dalinar. "Hope you don't mind," Sebarial said. "We liberated your stores. They were blowing past at the time, headed for certain doom." Dalinar stared at them. Palona even had a novel out and was reading. "You did this?" Dalinar asked, nodding toward Roion's army. "They were making a racket," Sebarial said. "Wandering around, shouting at one another, weeping and wailing. Very poetic. Figured someone should get them moving. My army is already off on that other plateau. It's getting rather cramped there, you realize." Palona flipped the page in her novel, barely paying attention. "Have you seen Aladar?" Dalinar asked. Sebarial gestured with his wine. "He should be about finished crossing as well. You'll find him that direction. Downwind, happily." "Don't dally," Dalinar said. "You remain here, and you're a dead man." "Like Roion?" Sebarial asked. "Unfortunately." "So it is true," Sebarial said, standing up, brushing off his trouserswhich were somehow still dry. "Who am I going to make fun of now?" He shook his head sadly. Dalinar rode off in the direction indicated. He noticed that, incredibly, a pair of bridgemen were still tailing him, only now catching up to where he'd found Sebarial. They saluted as Dalinar noticed them. He told them where he was going, then sped up. Storms. In terms of pain, riding with broken ribs wasn't much better than walking with them. Worse, actually. He did find Aladar on the next plateau over, supervising his army as it seeped onto the perfectly round plateau that Shallan had indicated. Rust Elthal was there as well, wearing his Plateone of the suits Adolin had wonand guiding one of Dalinar's large, mechanical bridges. It settled down next to two others that spanned the chasm here, crossing in places the smaller bridges wouldn't have been able to. The plateau everyone was crowding onto was relatively small, by the scale of the Shattered Plainsbut it was still several hundred yards across. It would fit the armies, hopefully. "Dalinar?" Aladar asked, trotting his horse over. Lit by a large diamond stolen from one of Navani's fabrial lights, it seemedhanging from his saddle, Aladar sported a soaked uniform and a bandage on his forehead, but appeared otherwise unharmed. "What in Kelek's tongue is going on out here? I can't get a straight answer from anyone." "Roion is dead," Dalinar said wearily, reining in Gallant. "He fell with honor, attacking the assassin. The assassin, hopefully, has been distracted for a time." "We won the day," Aladar said. "I scattered those Parshendi. We left well over half of them dead on that plateau, perhaps even three quarters. Adolin did even better on his plateau, and from reports, the ones on Roion's plateau have fled. The Vengeance Pact is fulfilled! Gavilar is avenged, and the war is over!" So proud. Dalinar had difficulty finding the words to deflate him, so he just stared at the other man. Feeling numb. Can't afford that, Dalinar thought, sagging in his saddle. Have to lead. "It doesn't matter, does it?" Aladar asked more softly. "That we won?" "Of course it matters." "But . . . shouldn't it feel different?" "Exhaustion," Dalinar said, "pain, suffering. This is what victory usually feels like, Aladar. We've won, yes, but now we have to survive with our victory. Your men are almost across?" He nodded. "Get everyone onto that plateau," Dalinar said. "Force them up against one another if you have to. We need to be ready to move through the portal as quickly as possible, once it is opened." If it opened. Dalinar urged Gallant forward, crossing one of the bridges to the packed ranks on the other side. From there, he forced his waywith difficultytoward the center, where he hoped to find salvation. * * * Kaladin shot into the air after the assassin. The Shattered Plains fell away beneath him. Fallen gemstones twinkled across the plateau, abandoned where tents had blown down or soldiers had fallen. They illuminated not only the central plateau, but three others around it and one more beyond, one that looked oddly circular from above. The armies gathered on that one. Small lumps dotted the others like freckles. Corpses. So many. Kaladin looked toward the sky. He was free once again. Winds surged beneath him, seeming to lift him, propel him. Carry him. His Shardblade shattered into mist and Syl zipped out, becoming a ribbon of light that spun around him as he flew. Syl lived. Syl lived. He still felt euphoric about that. Shouldn't she be dead? When he'd asked on their flight out, her response had been simple. I was only as dead as your oaths, Kaladin. Kaladin continued upward, out of the path of the oncoming storms. He could see those distinctly from this vantage. Two of them, one rolling from the west and bursting with red lightning, the other approaching more quickly from the east with a dark grey stormwall. They were going to collide. "A highstorm," Kaladin said, shooting up through the sky after Szeth. "The red storm is from the Parshendi, but why is there a highstorm coming? This isn't the time for one." "My father," Syl said, voice growing solemn. "He brought the storm, rushing its pace. He's . . . broken, Kaladin. He doesn't think any of this should be happening. He wants to end it all, wash everyone away, and try to hide from the future." Her father . . . did that mean the Stormfather wanted them dead? Great. The assassin disappeared above, vanishing into the dark clouds. Kaladin gritted his teeth, Lashing himself upward again for more acceleration. He shot into the clouds, and all around him became featureless grey. He kept watch for glimmers of light to announce the assassin coming for him. He might not have much warning. The area around him lightened. Was that the assassin? Kaladin extended his hand to the side, and Syl formed into the Blade immediately. "Not ten heartbeats?" he asked. Not when I'm here with you, ready. The delay is primarily something of the dead. They need to be revived each time. Kaladin burst out of the clouds and into sunlight. He gasped. He'd forgotten that it was still daytime. Here, far above the earthy darkness of war, the sunlight beat upon the cover of clouds, making them glow with pale beauty. The thin air was frigid, but raging Stormlight inside him made that easy to ignore. The assassin hovered nearby, toes pointed downward, head bowed, silvery Shardblade held to the side. Kaladin Lashed himself so that he stopped, then sank level with the assassin. "I am SzethsonsonVallano," the man said. "Truthless . . . Truthless." He looked up, eyes wide, teeth clenched. "You have stolen Honorblades. It is the only explanation." Storms. Kaladin had always imagined the Assassin in White as a calm, cold killer. This was something different. "I possess no such weapon," Kaladin said. "And I don't know why it would matter if I did." "I hear your lies. I know them." Szeth shot forward, sword out. Kaladin Lashed himself to the side, jerking out of the way. He swiped with his Blade, but didn't come close to connecting. "I should have practiced more with the sword," he muttered. Oh. That's right. You probably want me to be a spear, don't you? The weapon fuzzed to mist, then elongated and grew into the shape of a silvery spear, with glowing, swirling glyphs along the sharpened sides of the spearhead. Szeth twisted in the air, Lashing himself back into a hovering position. He looked at the spear, then seemed to tremble. "No. Truthless. I am Truthless. No questions." Stormlight streaming from his mouth, Szeth threw his head back and screamed; a futile, human sound that dissipated in the infinite expanse of sky. Beneath them, thunder rumbled and the clouds shivered with color. * * * Shallan dashed from lamp to lamp in the circular chamber, infusing each one with Stormlight. She glowed brightly, having drawn the Light from the ardents' lanterns. There wasn't time for explanation. So much for keeping her nature as a Surgebinder hidden. This room was a giant fabrial, powered by the Stormlight of those lamps. She should have seen it. She passed Inadara, who stared at her. "How . . . how are you doing this, Brightness?" Several of the scholars had settled onto the ground where they hurriedly sketched glyphward prayers onto cloths, using chalk because of the moisture. Shallan didn't know if those prayers were a request for safety from the storms or from Shallan herself. She did hear the words "Lost Radiant" murmured by one. Two more lanterns. She infused a ruby with Stormlight, bringing it to life, but then ran out of Light. "Gemstones!" she said, spinning on the room. "I need more Stormlight." The people inside looked to one another, all but Renarin, who continued to scratch identical glyphs on the rocks as he wept. Stormfather. She'd bled them all dry. One of the scholars had dug an oil lantern from her pack, and it paled beside the lamps on the walls. Shallan ducked out of the opening in the door, looking at the mass of soldiers who gathered there. Thousands upon thousands shuffled in the darkness. Fortunately, some of them carried lanterns. "I need your Stormlight!" she said. "It" Was that Adolin? Shallan gasped, other thoughts fleeing for the moment as she spotted him in the front of the crowd, leaning on a bridgeman for support. Adolin was a mess, the left side of his face a patchwork of blood and bruises, his uniform ripped and bloodied. Shallan ran to him, pulling him close. "Good to see you too," he said, burying his face in her hair. "I hear you're going to get us out of this mess." "Mess?" she asked. Thunder rumbled and cracked without pause as red lightning blasted down not in streaks but in sheets. Storms! She hadn't realized it was so close! "Mmm . . ." Pattern said. She looked left. A stormwall was approaching. The storms were like two hands, closing in to crush the armies between them. Shallan breathed in sharply, and Stormlight entered her, bringing her to life. Adolin had a gemstone or two on him, apparently. He pulled back, looking her over. "You too?" he said. "Um . . ." She bit her lip. "Yeah. Sorry." "Sorry? Storms, woman! Can you fly like he does?" "Fly?" Thunder cracked. Impending doom. Right. "Make sure everyone is ready to move!" she said, dashing back into the chamber. * * * Storms crashed together beneath Kaladin. The clouds broke apart, black, red, and grey mingling in enormous swirls, lightning arcing among them. It seemed to be Aharietiam again, the ending of all things. Above all this, atop the world, Kaladin fought for his life. Szeth flew by in a sweeping flash of silvery metal. Kaladin deflected the blow, the spear in his hand vibrating with a plangent ding. Szeth continued on, passing him, and Kaladin Lashed himself in that direction. They fell westward, skimming the tops of the cloudsthough to Kaladin's eyes, that direction was down. He fell with his spear aimed, point straight toward the murderous Shin. Szeth jerked left, and Kaladin followed, quickly Lashing himself that way. Violent, churning, angry clouds mixed beneath him. The two storms seemed to be fighting; the lightning that lit them was like thrown punches. Crashes sounded, and not all of them thunder. Near Kaladin a large stone churned up through the clouds, spinning vapors across its length. It breached in the light like a leviathan, then sank back into the clouds. Stormfather . . . He was hundreds, perhaps thousands of feet in the air. What kind of violence was happening below if boulders were thrown this high? Kaladin Lashed himself toward Szeth, picking up speed, moving along the top surface of the storms. He drew close, then eased back, letting his acceleration match that of Szeth so they flew side by side. Kaladin drove his spear toward the assassin. Szeth parried deftly, Shardblade held in one hand while supporting the Blade from behind with the other, diverting Kaladin's thrust to the side. "The Knights Radiant," Szeth screamed, "cannot have returned." "They have," Kaladin said, yanking his spear back. "And they're going to kill you." He Lashed himself slightly to the side as he swung, twisting in the air and sweeping toward Szeth. Szeth jerked upward, however, passing over Kaladin's spear. As they continued to fall through the air, clouds just beside them, Szeth dove inward and struck. Kaladin cursed, barely Lashing himself away in time. Szeth dove past him, disappearing into the clouds below, becoming just a shadow. Kaladin tried to trace that shadow, but failed. Szeth burst up beside Kaladin a second later, striking with three quick blows. One took Kaladin in the arm, and he dropped Syl. Damnation. He Lashed himself back away from Szeth, then forced Stormlight into his greying, lifeless hand. With an effort, he made the color return, but Szeth was already upon him with an airborne lunge. Mist formed in Kaladin's left hand as he raised it to ward, and a silvery shield appeared, glowing with a soft light. Szeth's Blade deflected away, causing the man to grunt in surprise. Strength returned to Kaladin's right hand, the severing healed, but forcing that much Stormlight through it left him feeling drained. He fell away from Szeth, trying to keep his distance, but the assassin kept on him, jerking each direction that Kaladin did as he tried to escape. "You are new at this," Szeth called. "You cannot fight me. I will win." Szeth zipped forward, and Syl formed into a spear in Kaladin's hands again. She seemed to be able to anticipate the weapon he wanted. Szeth slammed his weapon against Syl. It brought them facetoface and they tumbled, eye to eye, their Lashings pulling them along the clouds. "I always win," Szeth said. He said it in a strange way, as if angry. "You're wrong," Kaladin said. "About me. I'm not new to this." "You only just acquired your abilities." "No. The wind is mine. The sky is mine. They have been mine since childhood. You are the trespasser here. Not me." They broke apart, Kaladin throwing the assassin backward. He stopped thinking so much about his Lashings, about what he should be doing. Instead, he let himself be. He dove for Szeth, coat flapping, spear pointed for the man's heart. Szeth got out of the way, but Kaladin dropped the spear and swung his hand in a great arc. Syl formed an axehead halberd. It came within inches of Szeth's face. The assassin cursed, but responded with his Blade. A shield was in Kaladin's hand a split second later, and he slammed away the attack. Syl shattered even as he did so, forming back into a sword as Kaladin thrust forward with empty hands. The sword appeared, and the weapon bit deeply into Szeth's shoulder. The assassin's eyes widened. Kaladin twisted his Blade, pulling it out of the assassin's flesh, then tried a backhand to end the man permanently. Szeth was too fast. He Lashed himself backward, forcing Kaladin to follow, piling on Lashing after Lashing. Szeth's hand still worked. Damnation. The strike to the shoulder hadn't fully severed the soul leading to the arm. And Kaladin's Stormlight was running out. Szeth's looked even lower, fortunately. The assassin seemed to be using it up at a much faster rate than Kaladin, judging by the decreased glow around him. Indeed, he didn't try to heal his shoulderwhich would have required a lot of Lightbut continued to flee, jerking back and forth, trying to outrun Kaladin. The shadowy battle continued below, a tangle of lightning, winds, and spinning clouds. As Kaladin chased Szeth, something gargantuan moved beneath the clouds, a shadow the size of a city. A second later, the top of an entire plateau broke through the dark clouds, twisting slowly, as if it had been thrown upward from below. Szeth almost ran into it. Instead, he Lashed upward enough to crest it, then landed on the surface. He ran along it as it turned lethargically in the air, its momentum running out. Kaladin landed behind him, though he retained most of a Lashing upward, keeping himself light. He ran up the side of the plateau, heading almost directly upward toward the sky, dodging to the side as Szeth suddenly twisted and cut through a rock formation, sending boulders tumbling downward. Rocks clattered along the surface of the plateau, which itself began to tumble back down toward the ground. Szeth reached the peak and threw himself off, and Kaladin followed shortly thereafter, launching from the stone surface, which sank like a dying ship into the roiling clouds. They continued their chase, but Szeth did it falling backward along the stormtop, his eyes on Kaladin. Wild eyes. "You're trying to convince me!" he shouted. "You can't be one of them!" "You've seen that I am," Kaladin shouted back. "The Voidbringers!" "Are back," Kaladin shouted. "THEY CAN'T BE. I AM TRUTHLESS!" The assassin panted. "I need not fight you. You are not my target. I have . . . I have work to do. I obey!" He turned and Lashed himself downward. Into the clouds, down toward the plateau where Dalinar had gone. * * * Shallan rushed into the room as the storms crashed together outside. What was she doing? There wasn't time. Even if she could open a portal, those storms were here. She wouldn't have time to get people through. They were dead. All of them. Thousands had probably already been swept to their deaths by the stormwall. She ran to the last lamp anyway, infusing its spheres. The floor started to glow. Ardents jumped to their feet in surprise and Inadara yelped. Adolin stumbled in through the doorway, a crashing wind and a spray of angry rain trailing him. Beneath them, the intricate design shone from within. It looked almost like stained glass. Gesturing frantically for Adolin to join her, Shallan ran across to the lock on the wall. "Sword," she shouted at Adolin over the sounds of storms outside. "In there!" Renarin had long since dismissed his. Adolin obeyed, scrambling forward, summoning his Shardblade. He rammed it into the slot, which again flowed to fit the weapon. Nothing happened. "It's not working," Adolin shouted. Only one answer. Shallan grabbed the hilt of his sword and whipped it outignoring the scream in her mind that came from touching itthen tossed it aside. Adolin's sword vanished to mist. A deep truth. "There is something wrong with your Blade, and with all Blades." She hesitated for just a second. "All but mine. Pattern!" He formed in her hands, the Blade she'd used to kill. The hidden soul. Shallan rammed it into the slot, and the weapon vibrated in her hands and glowed. Something deep within the plateau unlocked. Outside, lightning fell and men screamed. Now the mechanism's operation became clear to her. Shallan threw her weight against the sword, pushing it before her like the spoke on a mill. The inner wall of the building was like a ring inside a tubeit could rotate, while the outer wall remained in place. The sword moved the inner wall as she pushed on it, though it stuck at first, the fallen blocks of the cut doorway getting in the way. Adolin threw his weight against the sword with her, and together they pushed it around the circle until they were above the picture of Urithiru, half the circumference from Natanatan where she'd begun. She pulled her Blade free. The ten lamps faded like closing eyes. * * * Kaladin followed Szeth into the storm, diving into the blackness, falling amid the churning winds and the blasting lightning. Wind attacked him, tossing him about, and no Lashings could prevent this. He might be master of the winds, but storms were another thing. Take care, Syl sent. My father hates you. This is his domain. And it is mixed with something even more terrible, another storm. Their storm. Nevertheless, the highstorms were the source of Stormlightand being in here energized Kaladin. His reserves of Stormlight burst alight, as they obviously did for Szeth. The assassin suddenly reappeared as a stark white explosion that zoomed through the maelstrom toward the plateaus. Kaladin growled, Lashing himself after Szeth. Lightning of a dozen colors flashed around him, red, violet, white, yellow. Rain soaked him. Rocks spun past him, some colliding, but the Stormlight healed him as quickly as the debris did damage. Szeth moved along the plateaus, coursing just above them, and Kaladin followed with difficulty. This churning wind was tough to navigate, and the darkness was near absolute. Flashes lit the Plains in fitful bursts. Fortunately, Szeth's glow could not be hidden, and Kaladin kept his attention on that blazing beacon. Faster. Just as Zahel had taught weeks ago, Szeth didn't need to defeat Kaladin to win. He just had to get to those Kaladin protected. Faster. A burst of lightning illuminated the battle plateaus. And beyond them, Kaladin caught a glimpse of the army. Thousands of men huddled on the large circular plateau. Many hunkered down. Others panicked. The lightning was gone in a moment, and the land became dark again, though Kaladin had seen enough to know this was a disaster. A cataclysm. Men being blown off the edge, others crushed by falling rocks. In minutes, the army would be gone. Storms, Kaladin wasn't even certain if he could survive this nexus of destruction. Szeth crashed down among them, a glowing light amid the blackness. As Kaladin Lashed himself down in that direction, lightning struck again. Its light revealed Szeth standing on an empty plateau, baffled. The army was gone. * * * The sounds of the raging storm outside vanished. Shallan shivered, wet and cold. "Almighty above . . ." Adolin breathed. "I'm almost scared of what we'll find." Rotating the inside wall of the building had moved their doorway opposite hardened crem. Perhaps there had been a natural doorway here before; Adolin summoned his Blade to cut a hole. Pattern . . . her Shardblade . . . vanished back to mist, and the room's mechanisms settled down. She didn't hear anything outside, no crashing of winds, no thunder. Emotions fought inside of her. She'd saved herself and Adolin, it appeared. But the rest of the army . . . Adolin cut a doorway; sunlight spilled through it. Shallan walked to the opening, nervous, passing Inadara, who sat in the corner, looking overwhelmed. At the doorway, Shallan looked out at the same plateau as before, only now it was sunlit and calm. Four armies' worth of men and women crouched, soggy and wet, many holding their heads and hunkering down against wind that no longer blew. Nearby, two figures stood beside a massive Ryshadium stallion. Dalinar and Navani, who had apparently been on their way to the central building. Beyond them spread the peaks of an unfamiliar mountain range. It was the same plateau, and here was in a ring with nine others. To Shallan's left, an enormous ribbed towershaped like cups of increasingly smaller sizes stacked atop one anotherbroke the peaks. Urithiru. The plateau hadn't contained the portal. The plateau was the portal. * * * Szeth screamed words at Kaladin, but those were lost in the tempest. Rocks crashed down around them, ripped from somewhere distant. Kaladin was sure he heard terrible screams over the winds, as red spren he'd never seen beforelike small meteors, trailing light behind themzipped around him. Szeth screamed again. Kaladin caught the word this time. "How!" Kaladin's answer was to strike with his Blade. Szeth parried violently, and they clashed, two glowing figures in the blackness. "I know this column!" Szeth screamed. "I have seen its like before! They went to the city, didn't they!" The assassin launched himself into the air. Kaladin was all too eager to follow. He wanted out of this tempest. Szeth screamed away, heading westward, away from the storm with the red lightningfollowing the path of the common highstorm. That alone was dangerous enough. Kaladin gave chase, but that proved difficult in the buffeting winds. It wasn't that they served Szeth more than Kaladin; the tempest was simply unpredictable. They'd shove him one way and Szeth another. What happened if Szeth lost him? He knows where Dalinar went, Kaladin thought, gritting his teeth as a flash of sudden whiteness blinded him from one side. I don't. He couldn't protect Dalinar if he couldn't find the man. Unfortunately, a chase through this darkness favored the person who was trying to escape. Slowly, Szeth pulled ahead. Kaladin tried to follow, but a surge of wind drove him in the wrong direction. Lashings didn't really let him fly. He couldn't resist such unpredictable winds; they controlled him. No! Szeth's glowing form dwindled. Kaladin shouted into the darkness, blinking eyes against the rain. He'd almost lost sight . . . Syl spun into the air in front of him. But he was still carrying the spear. What? Another one, then another. Ribbons of light, occasionally taking the shapes of young women or men, laughing. Windspren. A dozen or more spun around him, leaving trails of light, their laughter somehow strong over the sounds of the storm. There! Kaladin thought. Szeth was ahead. Kaladin Lashed himself through the tempest toward him, jerking one way, then the other. Dodging blitzes of lightning, ducking under hurled boulders, blinking away the sheets of driven rain. A whirlwind of chaos. And ahead . . . light? The stormwall. Szeth burst free of the storm's very front. Through the mess of water and debris, Kaladin could just barely make out the assassin turning around to look backward, his posture confident. He thinks he's lost me. Kaladin exploded out of the stormwall, surrounded by windspren that spiraled away in a pattern of light. He shouted, driving his spear toward Szeth, who parried hastily, his eyes wide. "Impossible!" Kaladin spun around and slashed his spearwhich became a swordthrough Szeth's foot. The assassin lurched away along the length of the stormwall. Both Szeth and Kaladin continued to fall westward, just in front of the wall of water and debris. Beneath them, the land passed in a blur. The two storms had finally separated, and the highstorm was moving along its normal path, east to west. The Shattered Plains were soon left behind, giving way to rolling hills. As Kaladin chased, Szeth spun and fell backward, attacking, though Syl became a shield to block. Kaladin swung down and a hammer appeared in his hand, crashing against Szeth's shoulder, breaking bones. As Stormlight tried to heal the assassin, Kaladin pulled in close and slammed his hand against Szeth's stomach, a knife appearing there and digging deeply into the skin. He sought the spine. Szeth gasped and frantically Lashed himself farther backward, pulling out of Kaladin's grip. Kaladin followed. Boulders churned in the stormwallwhich was now the ground from Kaladin's perspective. He had to repeatedly adjust his Lashing to stay in the right place, just ahead of the storm. Kaladin leaped on churning boulders as they appeared, pursuing Szeth, who fell wildly, his clothing flapping. Windspren formed a halo around Kaladin, zipping in and out, spiraling, spinning around his arms and legs. The proximity of the storm kept his Stormlight stoked, never letting it grow dim. Szeth slowed, his wounds healing. He hung in front of the crashing stormwall, holding his sword before him. He took a breath, meeting Kaladin's eyes. An ending, then. Kaladin drove forward, Syl forming a spear in his fingers, the most familiar weapon. Szeth attacked in a sequence, a relentless blur of strikes. Kaladin blocked each one. He ended with his spear against the hilt of Szeth's Blade, pressing the two together, mere inches from the assassin's face. "It is actually true," Szeth whispered. "Yes." Szeth nodded, and the edge of tension seemed to fade from him, replaced by an emptiness in his eyes. "Then I was right all along. I was never Truthless. I could have stopped the murders at any time." "I don't know what that means," Kaladin said. "But you never had to kill." "My orders" "Excuses! If that was why you murdered, then you're not the evil man I assumed. You're a coward instead." Szeth looked him in the eyes, then nodded. He pushed Kaladin back, then moved to swing. Kaladin drove his hands forward, forming Syl into a sword. He expected a parry. The move was intended to draw Szeth out of his attack pattern. Szeth did not parry. He just closed his eyes. Kaladin drove his Blade into the assassin's chest right below the neck, severing the spine. Smoke burned out from beneath his eyelids, and his Blade slipped from his fingers. It did not vanish. Get that! Syl sent him, a mental shout. Grab it, Kaladin. Don't lose it! Kaladin dove after the Blade, dropping Szeth's corpse, letting it fall backward into the stormwall. It vanished among the wind, the rain, and the lightning, trailing faint wisps of Stormlight. Kaladin grabbed the Blade just before the storm consumed it. Then he Lashed himself back upward, passing along the stormwall, the windspren he'd attracted spiraling about him and laughing with pure joy. As he crested the top of the storm, they burst around him and zipped away, moving off to dance in front of the stilladvancing storm. That left him with only one. Sylin the form of a young woman in a fluttering dress, fullsized this timehovered before him. She smiled as the storm moved beneath them. "That was very nicely done," she said. "Perhaps I'll keep you around this time." "Thank you." "You almost killed me, you realize." "I realize. I thought I had." "And?" "And . . . um . . . you are intelligent and articulate?" "You forgot the compliment." "But I just said" "Those were simple statements of fact." "You're wonderful," he said. "Truly, Syl. You are." "Also a fact," she said, grinning. "But I'll let it slide so long as you're willing to present me with a sufficiently sincere smile." He did. And it felt very, very good. Chaos in Alethkar is, of course, inevitable. Watch carefully, and do not let power in the kingdom solidify. The Blackthorn could become an ally or our greatest foe, depending on whether he takes the path of the warlord or not. If he seems likely to sue for peace, assassinate him expeditiously. The risk of competition is too great. From the Diagram, Writings upon the Bedstand Lamp: paragraph 4 (Adrotagia's 3rd translation from the original hieroglyphics) The Shattered Plains had been shattered again. Kaladin strolled across them with Szeth's Shardblade on his shoulder. He passed heaps of rock and fresh cracks in the ground. Enormous puddles like small lakes shimmered amid huge chunks of broken stone. Just to his left, an entire plateau had crumbled into the chasms around it. The jagged, rippedup base of the plateau had a black, charred cast to it. "This is going to happen again?" Kaladin said. "That other storm is still out there?" "Yes," Syl said, sitting on his shoulder. "A new storm. It's not of us, but of him." "Will it be this bad every time it passes?" Kaladin asked, surveying the wreckage. Of the plateaus he could see, only the one had been destroyed completely. But if the storm could do that to pure rock, what would it do to a city? Particularly since it blew the wrong way. Stormfather . . . Laits would no longer be laits. Buildings that had been constructed to face away from the storms would suddenly be exposed. "I don't know," Syl said softly. "This is a new thing, Kaladin. Not from before. I don't know how it happened or what it means. Hopefully, it won't be this bad except when a highstorm and an everstorm crash into each other." Kaladin grunted, picking his way over to the edge of his current plateau. He breathed in a little Stormlight, then Lashed himself upward to offset the natural pull of the ground. He became weightless. He pushed off lightly with his foot and drifted across the chasm to the next plateau. "So how did the army vanish like that?" he asked, removing his Lashing and settling down on the rock. "Uh . . . how should I know?" Syl said. "I was kind of distracted." He grunted. Well, this was the plateau where everyone had been. Perfectly round. Odd, that. On a nearby plateau, what had once been a large hill had been cracked wide open, exposing the remnants of a building inside. This perfectly circular one was far more flat, though it looked like there was a hill or something at the center. He strode in that direction. "So they're all spren," he said. "Shardblades." Syl grew solemn. "Dead spren," Kaladin added. "Dead," Syl agreed. "Then they live again a little when someone summons them, syncing a heartbeat to their essence." "How can something be 'a little' alive?" "We're spren," Syl said. "We're forces. You can't kill us completely. Just . . . sort of." "That's perfectly clear." "It's perfectly clear to us," Syl said. "You're the strange ones. Break a rock, and it's still there. Break a spren, and she's still there. Sort of. Break a person, and something leaves. Something changes. What's left is just meat. You're weird." "I'm glad we established that," he said, stopping. He couldn't see any evidence of the Alethi. Had they really escaped? Or had a sudden surge of the storm swept them all into the chasms? It seemed unlikely such a disaster would have left nothing behind. Please let it not be so. He lifted Szeth's sword off his shoulder and set it down, point first, in front of him. It sank a few inches into the rock. "What about this?" he asked, looking over the thin, silvery weapon. An unornamented Blade. That was supposed to be odd. "It doesn't scream when I hold it." "That's because it's not a spren," Syl said softly. "What is it, then?" "Dangerous." She stood up from his shoulder, then walked as if down a flight of steps toward the sword. She rarely flew when she had a human form. She flew as a ribbon of light, or as a group of leaves, or as a small cloud. He'd never noticed before how odd, yet normal, it was that she stuck to the nature of the form she used. She stopped just before the sword. "I think this is one of the Honorblades, the swords of the Heralds." Kaladin grunted. He'd heard of those. "Any man who holds this weapon will become a Windrunner," Syl explained, looking back at Kaladin. "The Honorblades are what we are based on, Kaladin. Honor gave these to men, and those men gained powers from them. Spren figured out what He'd done, and we imitated it. We're bits of His power, after all, like this sword. Be careful with it. It is a treasure." "So the assassin wasn't a Radiant." "No. But Kaladin, you have to understand. With this sword, someone can do what you can, but without the . . . checks a spren requires." She touched it, then shivered visibly, her form blurring for a second. "This sword gave the assassin power to use Lashings, but it also fed upon his Stormlight. A person who uses this will need far, far more Light than you will. Dangerous levels of it." Kaladin reached out and took the sword by the hilt, and Syl flitted away, becoming a ribbon of light. He hefted the weapon and set it back on his shoulder before continuing on his way. Yes, there was a hill up ahead, probably a cremcovered building. As he drew closer, blessedly, he saw motion around it. "Hello?" he called. The figures near it stopped and turned. "Kaladin?" a familiar voice called. "Storms, is that you?" He grinned, the figures resolving into men in blue uniforms. Teft scrambled across the rock like a madman to meet him. Others came after, shouting and laughing. Drehy, Peet, Bisig, and Sigzil, Rock towering over them all. "Another one?" Rock asked, eyeing Kaladin's Shardblade. "Or is he yours?" "No," Kaladin said. "I took this from the assassin." "He is dead, then?" Teft asked. "Yes." "You slew the Assassin in White," Bisig breathed. "It's truly over then." "I suspect that it is just beginning," Kaladin said, nodding toward the building. "What is this place?" "Oh!" Bisig said. "Come on! We need to show you the towerthat Radiant girl taught us how to summon the plateau back, so long as we have you." "Radiant girl?" Kaladin asked. "Shallan?" "You don't sound surprised," Teft said with a grunt. "She has a Shardblade," Kaladin said. One that didn't scream in his mind. Either she was a Radiant or she had another of these Honorblades. As he stepped up to the building, he noticed a bridge in the shadows nearby. "It's not ours," Kaladin said. "No," Leyten said. "That belongs to Bridge Seventeen. We had to leave ours behind in the storm." Rock nodded. "We were too busy stopping lighteyed heads from becoming too friendly with swords of enemies. Ha! But we needed bridge here. Way platform works, we had to get off him for Shallan Davar to transport herself back." Kaladin poked his head into the chamber inside the hill, then paused at the beauty he found inside. Other members of Bridge Four waited here, including a tall man Kaladin didn't immediately recognize. Was that one of Lopen's cousins? The man turned around, and Kaladin realized what he'd mistaken for a cap was a reddish skullplate. Parshendi. Kaladin tensed as the Parshendi man saluted. He was wearing a Bridge Four uniform. And he had the tattoo. "Rlain?" Kaladin said. "Sir," Rlain said. His features were no longer rounded and plump, but instead sharp, muscular, with a thick neck and a stronger jaw, now lined by a red and black beard. "It appears you are more than you seemed," Kaladin said. "Pardon, sir," he said. "But I would suggest that applies to both of us." When he spoke now, his voice had a certain musicality to itan odd rhythm to his words. "Brightlord Dalinar has pardoned Rlain," Sigzil explained, walking around Kaladin and entering the chamber. "For being Parshendi?" Kaladin asked. "For being a spy," Rlain said. "A spy for a people who, it appears, no longer exist." He said this to a different beat, and Kaladin thought he could sense pain in that voice. Rock walked over and put a hand on Rlain's shoulder. "We can give you the story once we get back to the city," Teft said. "We figured you'd come back here," Sigzil added. "To this plateau, and so we needed to be here to greet you, for all Brightness Davar grumbled. Anyway, there's a lot to tella lot is happening. I think that you're kind of going to be at the center of it." Kaladin took a deep breath, but nodded. What else did he expect? No more hiding. He had made his decision. What do I tell them about Moash? he wondered as the members of Bridge Four piled into the room around him, chattering about how he needed to infuse the spheres in the lanterns. A couple of the men bore wounds from the fighting, including Bisig, who kept his right hand in his coat pocket. Grey skin peeked out from the cuff. He'd lost the hand to the Assassin in White. Kaladin pulled Teft aside. "Did we lose anyone else?" Kaladin asked. "I saw Mart and Pedin." "Rod," Teft said with a grunt. "Dead to the Parshendi." Kaladin closed his eyes, breathing out in a hiss. Rod had been one of Lopen's cousins, a jovial Herdazian who hardly spoke Alethi. Kaladin had barely known him, but the man had still been Bridge Four. Kaladin's responsibility. "You can't protect us all, son," Teft said. "You can't stop people from feeling pain, can't stop men from dying." Kaladin opened his eyes, but did not challenge those statements. Not vocally, at least. "Kal," Teft said, voice getting even softer. "At the end there, right before you arrived . . . Storms, son, I swear I saw a couple of the lads glowing. Faintly, with Stormlight." "What?" "I've been listening to readings of those visions Brightlord Dalinar sees," Teft continued. "I think you should do the same. From what I can guess, it seems that the orders of the Knights Radiant were made up of more than just the knights themselves." Kaladin looked over the men of Bridge Four, and found himself smiling. He shoved down the pain at his losses, at least for the time being. "I wonder," he said softly, "what it will do to Alethi social structure when an entire group of former slaves starts going about with glowing skin." "Not to mention those eyes of yours," Teft said with a grunt. "Eyes?" Kaladin said. "Haven't you seen?" Teft said. "What am I saying? Ain't no mirrors out on the Plains. Your eyes, son. Pale blue, like glassy water. Lighter than that of any king." Kaladin turned away. He'd hoped his eyes wouldn't change. The truth, that they had, made him uncomfortable. It said worrisome things. He didn't want to believe that lighteyes had any grounds upon which to build the oppression. They still don't, he thought, infusing the gemstones in the lanterns as Sigzil instructed him. Perhaps the lighteyes rule because of the memory, buried deeply, of the Radiants. But just because they look a little like Radiants doesn't mean they should have been able to oppress everyone. Storming lighteyes. He . . . He was one of them now. Storm it! He summoned Syl as a Blade, following Sigzil's instructions, and used her as a key to work the fabrial. * * * Shallan stood at the front gates of Urithiru, looking up, trying to comprehend. Inside, voices echoed in the grand hall and lights bobbed as people explored. Adolin had taken command of that endeavor, while Navani set up a camp to see to the wounded and to measure supplies. Unfortunately, they'd left most of their food and gear behind on the Shattered Plains. In addition, the travel through the Oathgate had not been as cheap as Shallan had first assumed. Somehow, the trip had drained the majority of the gemstones held by the men and women on the plateauincluding Navani's fabrials, clutched in the hands of engineers and scholars. They had run a few tests. The more people you moved, the more Light was required. It seemed that Stormlight, and not just the gemstones that contained it, would become a valuable resource. Already, they had to ration their gemstones and lanterns to explore the building. Several scribes passed by, bringing paper to draw out maps of Adolin's exploration. They bobbed quick, uncomfortable bows to Shallan and called her "Brightness Radiant." She still hadn't talked at length with Adolin about what had happened to her. "Is it true?" Shallan asked, tilting her head all the way back, looking up the side of the enormous tower toward the blue sky high above. "Am I one of them?" "Mmm . . ." Pattern said from her skirt. "Almost you are. Still a few Words to say." "What kind of words? An oath?" "Lightweavers make no oaths beyond the first," Pattern said. "You must speak truths." Shallan stared up at the heights for a time longer, then turned and walked back down toward their improvised camp. It was not the Weeping here. She wasn't certain if that was because they were actually above the rainclouds, or if the weather patterns had simply been thrown off by the arrival of the strange highstorms. In camp, men sat on the stone, divided by ranks, shivering in their wet coats. Shallan's breath puffed before her, though she had taken in Stormlightjust a dashto keep herself from noticing the cold. Unfortunately, there wasn't much to use for fires. The large stone field in front of the tower city bore very few rockbuds, and the ones that did grow were tiny, smaller than a fist. They would provide little wood for fires. The field was ringed by ten columnar plateaus, with steps winding around their bases. The Oathgates. Beyond that extended the mountain range. Crem did cover some of the steps here, and dripped over the sides of the open field. There wasn't nearly as much as there had been on the Shattered Plains. Less rain must fall up here. Shallan stepped up to one edge of the stone field. A sheer drop. If Nohadon really had walked to this city, as The Way of Kings claimed, then his path would have included scaling cliff faces. So far, they had found no way down other than through the Oathgatesand even if there were such a way, one would still be stranded in the middle of the mountains, weeks from civilization. Judging from the sun height, the scholars placed them near the center of Roshar, somewhere in the mountains near Tu Bayla or maybe Emul. The remote location made the city incredibly defensible, or so Dalinar said. It also left them isolated, potentially cut off. And that, in turn, explained why everyone looked at Shallan as they did. They'd tried other Shardblades; none were effective at making the ancient fabrial work. Shallan was literally their only way out of these mountains. One of the soldiers nearby cleared his throat. "You certain you should be that close to the edge, Brightness Radiant?" She gave the man a droll look. "I could survive that drop and stroll away, soldier." "Um, yes, Brightness," he said, blushing. She left the edge and continued on to find Dalinar. Eyes followed her as she walked: soldiers, scribes, lighteyes, and highlords alike. Well, let them see Shallan the Radiant. She could always find freedom later, wearing another face. Dalinar and Navani supervised a group of women near the center of the army. "Any luck?" Shallan asked, approaching. Dalinar glanced at her. The scribes wrote letters using every spanreed they had, delivering messages of warning to the warcamps and to the relay room in Tashikk. A new storm might come, blowing in from the west, not the east. Prepare. New Natanan, on the very eastern coast of Roshar, would be struck today after the everstorm left the Shattered Plains. Then it would enter the eastern ocean and move toward the Origin. None of them knew what would happen next. Would it round the world and come crashing into the western coast? Were the highstorms all one storm that rounded the planet, or did a new one start at the Origin each time, as mythology claimed? Scholars and stormwardens thought the former, these days. Their calculations said that, assuming the everstorm moved at the same speed as a highstorm this time of year, they'd have a few days before it returned and hit Shinovar and Iri, then blew across the continent, laying waste to cities thought protected. "No news," Dalinar said, voice tense. "The king seems to have vanished. What's more, Kholinar appears to be in a state of riot. I haven't been able to get straight answers on either question." "I'm sure the king is somewhere safe," Shallan said, glancing at Navani. The woman maintained a composed face, but as she gave instructions to a scribe, her voice was terse and clipped. One of the pillarlike plateaus nearby flashed. It happened with a wall of light revolving around its perimeter, leaving streaks of blurred afterimage to fade. Someone had activated the Oathgate. Dalinar stepped up beside her and they waited tensely, until a group of figures in blue appeared at the plateau edge and started down the steps. Bridge Four. "Oh, thank the Almighty," Shallan whispered. It was him, not the assassin. One of the figures pointed down toward where Dalinar and the rest of them stood. Kaladin separated from his men, dropping off the steps and floating over the army. He landed on the stones in stride, carrying a Shardblade on his shoulder, his long officer's coat unbuttoned and coming down to his knees. He still has the slave brands, she thought, though his long hair obscured them. His eyes had become a pale blue. They glowed softly. "Stormblessed," Dalinar called. "Highprince," Kaladin said. "The assassin?" "Dead," Kaladin said, hefting the Blade and sticking it down into the rock before Dalinar. "We need to talk. This" "My son, bridgeman," Navani asked from behind. She stepped up and took Kaladin by the arm, as if completely unconcerned by the Stormlight that drifted from his skin like smoke. "What happened to my son?" "There was an assassination attempt," Kaladin said. "I stopped it, but the king was wounded. I put him someplace safe before coming to help Dalinar." "Where?" Navani demanded. "We've had our people in the warcamps search monasteries, mansions, the barracks . . ." "Those places were too obvious," Kaladin said. "If you could think to look there, so might the assassins. I needed someplace nobody would think of." "Where, then?" Dalinar asked. Kaladin smiled. * * * The Lopen made a fist with his hand, clutching the sphere inside. In the next room over, his mother scolded a king. "No, no, Your Majesty," she said, words thickly accented, using the same stern tone she used with the axehounds. "You roll the whole thing up and eat it. You can't pick it apart like that." "I don't feel so hungry, nanha," Elhokar said. His voice was weak, but he'd awoken from his drunken stupor, which was a good sign. "You'll eat anyway!" Mother said. "I know what to do when I see a man that pale in the face, and pardon, Your Majesty, but you are pale as a sheet hung out for the sun to bleach! And that's the truth of it. You're going to eat. No complaints." "I'm the king. I don't take orders from" "You're in my home now!" she said, and Lopen mouthed along with the words. "In a Herdazian woman's home, nobody's station means nothing beside her own. I'm not going to have them come and get you and find you not properly fed! I'll not have people saying that, Your Brightship, no I won't! Eat up. I've got soup cooking." The Lopen smiled, and though he heard the king grumble, he also heard the sound of spoon against plate. Two of Lopen's strongest cousins sat out front of the hovel in Little Herdazwhich was technically in Highprince Sebarial's warcamp, though the Herdazians didn't pay much attention to that. Four more cousins sat at the end of the street, idly sewing some boots, watching for anything suspicious. "All right," Lopen whispered, "you really need to work this time." He focused on that sphere in his hand. Just like he did every day, and had done every day since Captain Kaladin had started glowing. He'd figure it out sooner or later. He was as sure of it as he was sure of his name. "Lopen." A wide face ducked in one of the windows, distracting him. Chilinko, his uncle. "Get the king man dressed up like a Herdazian again. We might need to move." "Move?" Lopen said, standing. "Word has come in to all the warcamps from Highprince Sebarial," Chilinko said in Herdazian. "They found something out there, on the Plains. Be ready. Just in case. Everyone's talking. I can't make sense of it." He shook his head. "First that highstorm nobody knew about, then the rains stop early, then the storming king man of Alethkar on my doorstep. Now this. I think we might be abandoning camp, even though nightfall's around the corner. Makes no sense to me, but get the king man taken care of." The Lopen nodded. "I'll get to it. Just a sec." Chilinko ducked away. Lopen opened his palm and stared at the sphere. He didn't want to miss a day practicing with his sphere, just in case. After all, sooner or later, he was going to look at one of these and The Lopen sucked in Light. It happened in an eyeblink, and then there he sat, Stormlight streaming from his skin. "Ha!" he shouted, leaping to his feet. "Ha! Hey, Chilinko, come back here. I need to stick you to the wall!" The Light winked out. The Lopen stopped, frowning, and held his hand up in front of him. Gone so fast? What had happened? He hesitated. That tingling . . . He felt at his shoulder, the one where he'd lost his arm so long ago. There, his fingers prodded a new nub of flesh that had begun sprouting from his scar. "Oh, storms yes! Everybody, give the Lopen your spheres! I have glowing that needs to be done." * * * Moash sat on the back of the cart as it rattled and wound its way out of the warcamps. He could have ridden in front, but he didn't want to be far from his armor, which they'd wrapped up in packages and stacked back here. Hidden. The Blade and Plate might be his in name, but he had no illusions as to what would happen if the Alethi elite noticed him trying to flee with it. His wagon crested the rise just outside of the warcamps. Behind them, enormous lines of people snaked out onto the Shattered Plains. Highprince Dalinar's orders had been clear, though baffling. The warcamps were being abandoned. All parshmen were to be left behind, and everyone was to make their way toward the center of the Shattered Plains. Some of the highprinces obeyed. Others did not. Curiously, Sadeas was one of those who obeyed, his warcamp emptying almost as quickly as those of Sebarial, Roion, and Aladar. It seemed like everyone was going, even the children. Moash's cart rolled to a stop. Graves stepped up beside the back a few moments later. "We needn't have worried about hiding," he mumbled, looking over the exodus. "They're too busy to pay attention to us. Look there." Some groups of merchants gathered outside of Dalinar's warcamps. They pretended to be packing to leave, but weren't making any obvious progress. "Scavengers," Graves said. "They'll head into the abandoned warcamps to loot. Storming fools. They deserve what is coming." "What is coming?" Moash said. He felt as if he had been tossed into a roiling river, one that had burst its banks following a highstorm. He swam with the current, but could barely keep his head above water. He'd tried to kill Kaladin. Kaladin. It had all fallen apart. The king survived, Kaladin's powers were back, and Moash . . . Moash was a traitor. Twice over. "Everstorm," Graves said. He didn't look nearly so refined, now that he wore the patchwork overalls and shirt of a poor darkeyes. He'd used some strange eyedrops to change his eyes dark, then had instructed Moash to do the same. "And that is?" "The Diagram is vague," Graves said. "We only knew the term because of old Gavilar's visions. The Diagram says this will probably return the Voidbringers, though. Those have turned out to be the parshmen, it seems." He shook his head. "Damnation. That woman was right." "Woman?" "Jasnah Kholin." Moash shook his head. He didn't understand any of what was happening. Graves's sentences felt like strings of words that shouldn't go together. Parshmen, Voidbringers? Jasnah Kholin? That was the king's sister. Hadn't she died at sea? What did Graves know of her? "Who are you really?" Moash asked. "A patriot," Graves said. "Just like I told you. We're allowed to pursue our own interests and goals until we're called up." He shook his head. "I thought for sure my interpretation was correct, that if we removed Elhokar, Dalinar would become our ally in what is to come. . . . Well, it appears I was wrong. Either that, or I was too slow." Moash felt sick. Graves gripped him on the arm. "Head up, Moash. Bringing a Shardbearer back with me will mean that my mission wasn't a complete loss. Besides, you can tell us about this new Radiant. I'll introduce you to the Diagram. We have an important work." "Which is?" "The salvation of the entire world, my friend." Graves patted him, then walked toward the front of the cart, where the others rode. The salvation of the entire world. I've been played for one of the ten fools, Moash thought, chin to his chest. And I don't even know how. The wagon started rolling again. 1173090605 1173090801 1173090901 1173091001 1173091004 1173100105 1173100205 1173100401 1173100603 1173100804 From the Diagram, North Wall Coda, Windowsill region: paragraph 2 (This appears to be a sequence of dates, but their relevance is as yet unknown.) They soon began to move into the tower. There was nothing else they could do, though Adolin's explorations were far from finished. Night was approaching, and the temperature was dropping outside. Beyond that, the highstorm that had hit the Shattered Plains would be raging across the land currently, and would eventually hit these mountains. It took over a day for one to cross the entire continent, and they were probably somewhere near the center, so it would be growing close. An unscheduled highstorm, Shallan thought, walking through the dark hallways with her guards. And something else coming from the other direction. She could tell that this towerits contents, every hallwaywas a majestic wonder. It spoke worlds about how tired she was that she didn't want to draw any of it. She just wanted to sleep. Their spherelight revealed something odd on the wall ahead. Shallan frowned, shaking off her fatigue and stepping up to it. A small folded piece of paper, like a card. She glanced back at her guards, who looked equally confused. She pulled the card off the wall; it had been stuck in place with some weevilwax on the back. Inside was the triangle symbol of the Ghostbloods. Beneath it, Shallan's name. Not Veil's name. Shallan's. Panic. Alertness. In a moment, she had sucked in the Light of their lantern, plunging the corridor into darkness. Light shone from a doorway nearby, however. She stared at it. Gaz moved to investigate, but Shallan stopped him with a gesture. Run or fight? Run where? she thought. Hesitant, she stepped up to the doorway, again motioning her guards back. Mraize stood inside, gazing out a large, glassless window that overlooked another section of the innards of this tower. He turned toward her, twisted and scarred, yet somehow refined in his gentleman's clothing. So. She had been found out. I am no longer a child who hides in her room when the shouting comes, she thought firmly to herself, walking into the room. If I run from this man, he will see me as something to be hunted. She stepped right up to him, ready to summon Pattern. He wasn't like other Shardblades; she acknowledged that now. He could come more quickly than the ten requisite heartbeats. He'd done that before. She hadn't been willing to admit that he was capable of it. Admitting that would have meant too much. How many more of my lies, she thought, hold me back from things I could accomplish? But she needed those lies. Needed them. "You led me on a grand hunt, Veil," Mraize said. "If your abilities had not been manifest during the course of saving the army, I perhaps never would have located your false identity." "Veil is the false identity, Mraize," Shallan said. "I am me." He inspected her. "I think not." She met that gaze, but shivered inside. "A curious position you are in," Mraize said. "Will you hide the true nature of your powers? I was able to guess what they are, but others will not be so knowledgeable. They might see only the Blade, and not ask what else you can do." "I don't see how it's a concern of yours." "You are one of us," Mraize said. "We look after our own." Shallan frowned. "But you've seen through the lie." "Are you saying you don't want to be one of the Ghostbloods?" His tone was not threatening, but those eyes . . . storms, those eyes could have drilled through stone. "We do not offer the invitation to just anyone." "You killed Jasnah," Shallan hissed. "Yes. After she, in turn, had assassinated a number of our members. You didn't think her hands were clean of blood, did you, Veil?" She looked away, breaking his gaze. "I should have guessed that you would turn out to be Shallan Davar," Mraize continued. "I feel a fool for not seeing it earlier. Your family has a long history of involvement in these events." "I will not help you," Shallan said. "Curious. You should know that I have your brothers." She looked to him sharply. "Your house is no more," Mraize said. "Your family's grounds seized by a passing army. I rescued your brothers from the chaos of the succession war, and am bringing them here. Your family, however, does owe me a debt. One Soulcaster. Broken." He met her eyes. "How convenient that you, by my estimations, are one, little knife." She summoned Pattern. "I will kill you before I let you use them as blackmail " "No blackmail," Mraize said. "They will arrive safe. A gift to you. You may wait upon my words and see. I mention your debt only so that it has a chance to find . . . purchase in your mind." She frowned, holding her Shardblade, wavering. "Why?" she finally asked. "Because, you are ignorant." Mraize stepped closer to her, towering over her. "You don't know who we are. You don't know what we're trying to accomplish. You don't know much of anything at all, Veil. Why did your father join us? Why did your brother seek out the Skybreakers? I have done some research, you see. I have answers for you." Surprisingly, he turned from her and walked toward the doorway. "I will give you time to consider. You seem to think that your newfound place among the Radiants makes you unfit for our numbers, but I see it differently, as does my babsk. Let Shallan Davar be a Radiant, conformist and noble. Let Veil come to us." He stopped by the doorway. "And let her find truth." He disappeared into the hallway. Shallan found herself feeling even more drained than before. She dismissed Pattern and leaned back against the wall. Of course Mraize would have found his way herehe'd likely been among the armies, somewhere. Getting to Urithiru had been one of the Ghostbloods' primary goals. Despite her determination not to help them, she'd transported themalong with the armyright where they wanted to go. Her brothers? Would they actually be safe? What of her family servants, her brother's betrothed? She sighed, walking to the doorway and collecting her guards. Let her find truth. What if she didn't want to find the truth? Pattern hummed softly. After walking through the tower's ground floorusing her own glow for light she found Adolin in the hallway beside a room, where he'd said he'd be. He had his wrist wrapped, and the bruises on his face were starting to purple. They made him look slightly less intoxicatingly handsome, though there was a rugged "I punched a lot of people today" quality to that, which was fetching in its own right. "You look exhausted," he said, giving her a peck of a kiss. "And you look like you let someone play sticks with your face," she said, but smiled at him. "You should get some sleep too." "I will," he said. "Soon." He touched her face. "You're amazing, you realize. You saved everything. Everyone." "No need to treat me like I'm glass, Adolin." "You're a Radiant," he said. "I mean . . ." He ran his hand through his persistently messy hair. "Shallan. You're something greater than even a lighteyes." "Was that a wisecrack about my girth?" "What? No. I mean . . ." He blushed. "I will not let this be awkward, Adolin." "But" She grabbed him in an embrace and forced him into a kiss, a deep and passionate one. He tried to mumble something, but she kept on kissing, pressing her lips against his, letting him feel her desire. He melted into the kiss, then grabbed her by the torso and pulled her close. After a moment, he pulled back. "Storms, that smarts!" "Oh!" Shallan raised a hand to her mouth, remembering the bruises on his face. "Sorry." He grinned, then winced again, as apparently that hurt too. "Worth it. Anyway, I'll promise to avoid being awkward if you avoid being too irresistible. At least until I'm healed up. Deal?" "Deal." He looked to her guards. "Nobody disturbs the Lady Radiant, understand?" They nodded. "Sleep well," he said, pushing open a door into the room. Many of the rooms still had wooden doors, despite their long abandonment. "Hopefully, the room is suitable. Your spren chose it." Her spren? Shallan frowned, then stepped into the room. Adolin closed the door. Shallan studied the windowless stone chamber. Why had Pattern chosen this particular place for her? The room didn't seem distinctive. Adolin had left a Stormlight lantern for her that was extravagant, considering how few lit gemstones they hadand it showed a small square chamber with a stone bench in the corner. There were a few blankets on it. Where had Adolin found blankets? She frowned at the wall. The rock here was faded in a square, as if someone had once hung a picture there. Actually, that looked oddly familiar. Not that she'd been here before, but the place that square hung on the wall . . . It was exactly in the same place where the picture had hung on her father's wall back in Jah Keved. Her mind started to fuzz. "Mmm . . ." Pattern said from the floor beside her. "It is time." "No." "It is time," he repeated. "The Ghostbloods circle you. The people need a Radiant." "They have one. The bridgeboy." "Not enough. They need you." Shallan blinked out tears. Against her will, the room started to change. White carpet appeared. A picture on the wall. Furniture. Walls painted light blue. Two corpses. Shallan stepped over one, though it was just an illusion, and walked to the wall. A painting had appeared, part of the illusion, and it was outlined with a white glow. Something was hidden behind it. She pulled aside the picture, or tried to. Her fingers only made the illusion blur. This was nothing. Just a recreation of a memory she wished she didn't have. "Mmm . . . A better lie, Shallan." She blinked away tears. Her fingers lifted, and she pressed them against the wall again. This time, she could feel the painting's frame. It wasn't real. For the moment, she pretended that it was, and let the image capture her. "Can't I just keep pretending?" "No." She was there, in her father's room. Trembling, she pulled aside the picture, revealing the strongbox in the wall beyond. She raised the key, and hesitated. "Mother's soul is inside." "Mmm . . . No. Not her soul. That which took her soul." Shallan unlocked the safe, then tugged it open, revealing the contents. A small Shardblade. Thrust into the strongbox hastily, tip piercing through the back, hilt toward her. "This was you," she whispered. "Mmm . . . Yes." "Father took you from me," Shallan said, "and tried to hide you in here. Of course, that was useless. You vanished as soon as he closed the strongbox. Faded to mist. He wasn't thinking clearly. Neither of us were." She turned. Red carpet. Once white. Her mother's friend lay on the floor, bleeding from the arm, though that wound hadn't killed him. Shallan walked to the other corpse, the one facedown in the beautiful dress of blue and gold. Red hair spilled out in a pattern around the head. Shallan knelt and rolled over her mother's corpse, confronting a skull with burnedout eyes. "Why did she try to kill me, Pattern?" Shallan whispered. "Mmm . . ." "It started when she found out what I could do." She remembered it now. Her mother's arrival, with a friend Shallan didn't recognize, to confront her father. Her mother's shouts, arguing with her father. Mother calling Shallan one of them. Her father barging in. Mother's friend with a knife, the two struggling, the friend getting cut in the arm. Blood spilled on the carpet. The friend had won that fight, eventually holding Father down, pinned on the ground. Mother took the knife and came for Shallan. And then . . . And then a sword in Shallan's hands. "He let everyone believe that he'd killed her," Shallan whispered. "That he'd murdered his wife and her lover in a rage, when I was the one who had actually killed them. He lied to protect me." "I know." "That secret destroyed him. It destroyed our entire family." "I know." "I hate you," she whispered, staring into her mother's dead eyes. "I know." Pattern buzzed softly. "Eventually, you will kill me, and you will have your revenge." "I don't want revenge. I want my family." Shallan wrapped her arms around herself and buried her head in them, weeping as the illusion bled white smoke, then vanished, leaving her in an empty room. * * * I can only conclude, Amaram wrote hurriedly, the glyphs a mess of sloppy ink, that we have been successful, Restares. The reports from Dalinar's army indicate that Voidbringers were not only spotted, but fought. Red eyes, ancient powers. They have apparently unleashed a new storm upon this world. He looked up from his pad and peeked out the window. His carriage rattled down the roadway in Dalinar's warcamp. All of his soldiers were away, and his remaining guards had gone to oversee the exodus. Even with Amaram's reputation, he'd been able to pass into the camp with ease. He turned back to his paper. I do not exult in this success, he wrote. Lives will be lost. It has ever been our burden as the Sons of Honor. To return the Heralds, to return the dominance of the Church, we had to put the world into a crisis. That crisis we now have, a terrible one. The Heralds will return. How can they not, with the problems we now face? But many will die. So very many. Nalan send that it is worth the loss. Regardless, I will have more information soon. When I next write you, I hope to do so from Urithiru. The coach pulled to a stop and Amaram pushed open the door. He handed the letter to the carriage driver, Pama. She took it and began digging in her satchel for the spanreed to send the communication to Restares. He would have done it himself, but you could not use a spanreed while moving. She would destroy the papers when done. Amaram spared a glance for the trunks on the back of the coach; they contained a precious cargo, including all of his maps, notes, and theories. Should he have left those with his soldiers? Bringing the force of fifty into Dalinar's warcamp would have drawn attention for certain, even with the chaos here, so he'd ordered them to meet him on the Plains. He needed to keep moving. He strode away from the coach, pulling up the hood on his cloak. The grounds of Dalinar's temple complex were even more frenzied than most of the warcamps, as many people had come to the ardents in this time of stress. He passed a mother begging for one of them to burn a prayer for her husband, who fought with Dalinar's army. The ardent kept repeating that she should gather her things and join the caravans heading out across the Plains. It was happening. It was really happening. The Sons of Honor had, at long last, achieved their goal. Gavilar would be proud. Amaram hastened his pace, turning as another ardent bustled up to him, to ask if he needed anything. Before she could look in his hood and recognize him, however, her attention was drawn by a pair of frightened youths who complained that their father was too old to make the trip, and begged for the ardents to help them carry him somehow. He made it to the corner of the monastery building where they kept the insane and rounded to the back wall, out of sight, near the rim of the warcamp itself. He looked about, then summoned his Blade. A few swift slices would What was that? He spun, certain he'd seen someone approach. But it was nothing. Shadows playing tricks on him. He made his slices in the wall and then carefully pushed open the hole he'd made. The Great OneTalenelat'Elin, Herald of War himself sat in the dark room, in much the same posture he'd borne before. Perched on the end of his bed, slumped forward, head bowed. "Why must they keep you in such darkness?" Amaram said, dismissing his Blade. "This is not fit for the lowliest of men, let alone one such as yourself. I will have words with Dalinar about the way the insane are" No, he would not. Dalinar thought him a murderer. Amaram drew in a long, deep breath. Prices would need to be paid to see the Heralds return, but by Jezerezeh himself, the loss of Dalinar's friendship would be a stiff one indeed. Would that mercy had not stayed his hand, all those months ago, when he could have executed that spearman. He hastened to the Herald's side. "Great Prince," Amaram whispered. "We must go." Talenelat did not move. He was whispering again, though. The same things as before. Amaram could not help being reminded of the last time he had visited this place, in the company of someone who had been playing him for one of the ten fools all along. Who knew that Dalinar had grown so crafty in his old age? Time had changed both of them. "Please, Great Prince," Amaram said, getting the Herald to his feet with some difficulty. The man was enormous, as tall as Amaram but built like a wall. The dark brown skin had surprised him the first time he'd seen the manAmaram had, somewhat foolishly, expected that all of the Heralds would look Alethi. The Herald's dark eyes were, of course, some kind of disguise. "The Desolation . . ." Talenelat whispered. "Yes. It comes. And with it, your return to glory." Amaram began to walk the Herald toward his opening. "We must get you to" The Herald's hand snapped up in front of him. Amaram started, freezing in place, as he saw something in the Herald's fingers. A small dart, the tip dripping with some clear liquid. Amaram glanced at the opening, which spilled sunlight into the room. A small figure there made a puffing sound, a blowgun held to lips beneath a half mask that covered the upper face. The Herald's other hand shot out, quick as an eyeblink, and snatched the dart from the air mere inches from Amaram's face. The Ghostbloods. They weren't trying to kill the Herald. They were trying to kill Amaram. He cried out, reaching his hand to the side, summoning his Blade. Too slow. The figure looked from him to the Herald, then scuttled away with a soft curse. Amaram chased after, leaping the rubble of the wall and breaking out into light, but the figure was moving too quickly. Heart thumping in his chest, he looked back toward Talenelat, worried for the Herald's safety. Amaram started as he found the Herald standing tall, straightbacked, head up. Dark brown eyes, startlingly lucid, reflected the light of the opening. Talenelat raised one dart before himself and inspected it. Then he dropped both darts and sat back down on his bed. His strange, unchanging mantra started over again, muttered. Amaram felt a chill run down his spine, but when he returned to the Herald, he could not get the man to respond. With effort, he made the Herald rise again and ushered him to the coach. * * * Szeth opened his eyes. He immediately squeezed them closed again. "No. I died. I died!" He felt rock beneath him. Blasphemy. He heard water dripping and felt the sun on his face. "Why am I not dead?" he whispered. "The Shardblade pierced me. I fell. Why didn't I die?" "You did die." Szeth opened his eyes again. He lay on an empty rock expanse, his clothing a wet mess. The Frostlands? He felt cold, despite the heat of the sun. A man stood before him, wearing a crisp black and silver uniform. He had dark brown skin like a man from the Makabaki region, but had a pale mark on his right cheek in the shape of a small hooked crescent. He held one hand behind his back, while his other hand tucked something away into his coat pocket. A fabrial of some sort? Glowing brightly? "I recognize you," Szeth realized. "I've seen you somewhere before." "You have." Szeth struggled to rise. He managed to make it to his knees, then knelt back on them. "How?" he asked. "I waited until you crashed to the ground," the man said, "until you were broken and mangled, your soul cut through, dead for certain. Then, I restored you." "Impossible." "Not if it is done before the brain dies. Like a drowned man restored to life with the proper ministrations, you could be restored with the right fabrial. If I had waited seconds longer, of course, it would have been too late." He spoke the words calmly, without emotion. "Who are you?" Szeth asked. "You spend this long obeying the precepts of your people and religion, yet you fail to recognize one of your gods?" "My gods are the spirits of the stones," Szeth whispered. "The sun and the stars. Not men." "Nonsense. Your people revere the spren of stone, but you do not worship them." That crescent . . . He recognized it, didn't he? "You, Szeth," the man said, "worship order, do you not? You follow the laws of your society to perfection. This attracted me, though I worry that emotion has clouded your ability to discern. Your ability to . . . judge." Judgment. "Nin," he whispered. "The one they call Nalan, or Nale, here. Herald of Justice." Nin nodded. "Why save me?" Szeth said. "Is my torment not enough?" "Those words are foolishness," Nin said. "Unbecoming of one who would study beneath me." "I don't want to study," Szeth said, curling up on the stone. "I want to be dead." "Is that it? Truly, that is what you wish most? I will give it to you, if it is your honest desire." Szeth squeezed his eyes shut. The screams awaited him in that darkness. The screams of those he'd killed. I was not wrong, he thought. I was never Truthless. "No," Szeth whispered. "The Voidbringers have returned. I was right, and my people . . . they were wrong." "You were banished by petty men with no vision. I will teach you the path of one uncorrupted by sentiment. You will bring this back to your people, and you will carry with you justice for the leaders of the Shin." Szeth opened his eyes and looked up. "I am not worthy." Nin cocked his head. "You? Not worthy? I watched you destroy yourself in the name of order, watched you obey your personal code when others would have fled or crumbled. SzethsonNeturo, I watched you keep your word with perfection. This is a thing lost to most peopleit is the only genuine beauty in the world. I doubt I have ever found a man more worthy of the Skybreakers than you." The Skybreakers? But that was an order of the Knights Radiant. "I have destroyed myself," Szeth whispered. "You did, and you died. Your bond to your Blade severed, all tiesboth spiritual and physicalundone. You are reborn. Come along. It is time to visit your people. Your training begins immediately." Nin began to walk away, revealing that the thing he held behind his back was a sheathed sword. You are reborn. Could he . . . could Szeth be reborn? Could he make the screams in the shadows go away? You are a coward, the Radiant had said, the man who owned the winds. A small piece of Szeth thought it true. But Nin offered more. Something different. Still kneeling, Szeth looked up after the man. "My people have the other Honorblades, and have kept them safe for millennia. If I am to bring judgment to them, I will face enemies with Shards and with power." "This is not a problem," Nin said, looking back. "I have brought a Shardblade for you. One that is a perfect match for your task and temperament." He tossed his large sword to the ground. It skidded on stone and came to a rest before Szeth. He had not seen a sword with a metal sheath before. And who sheathed a Shardblade? And the Blade itself . . . was it black? An inch or so of it had emerged from the sheath as it slid on the rocks. Szeth swore he could see a small trail of black smoke coming off the metal. Like Stormlight, only dark. Hello, a cheerful voice said in his mind. Would you like to destroy some evil today? TherehastobeananswerWhatistheanswerStopTheParshendiOneofthemYestheyar From the Diagram, Floorboard 17: paragraph 2, every second letter starting with the second Dalinar stood in darkness. He turned about, trying to remember how he'd come to this place. In the shadows, he saw furniture. Tables, a rug, drapes from Azir with wild colors. His mother had always been proud of those drapes. My home, he thought. As it was when I was a child. Back before conquest, back before Gavilar . . . Gavilar . . . hadn't Gavilar died? No, Dalinar could hear his brother laughing in the next room. He was a child. They both were. Dalinar crossed the shadowed room, feeling the fuzzy joy of familiarity. Of things being as they should be. He'd left his wooden swords out. He had a collection, each carved like a Shardblade. He was too old for those now, of course, but he still liked having them. As a collection. He stepped to the balcony doors and pushed them open. Warm light bathed him. A deep, enveloping, piercing warmth. A warmth that soaked down deep through his skin, into his very self. He stared at that light, and was not blinded. The source was distant, but he knew it. Knew it well. He smiled. Then he awoke. Alone in his new rooms in Urithiru, a temporary location for him to stay while they scouted the entire tower. A week had passed since they had arrived at this place, and the people of the warcamps had finally started to arrive, bearing spheres recharged during the unexpected highstorm. They needed those badly to make the Oathgate function. Those from the warcamps arrived none too soon. The Everstorm had not yet returned, but if it moved like a regular highstorm, it should be striking any day now. Dalinar sat in the darkness for a short time, contemplating that warmth he had felt. What had that been? It had been an odd time to get one of the visions. They always came during highstorms. Before, when he'd felt one coming on while sleeping, it had awakened him. He checked with his guards. No highstorm was blowing. Contemplative, he started to dress. He wanted to see if he could get out onto the roof of the tower today. * * * As Adolin walked the dark halls of Urithiru, he tried not to show how overwhelmed he felt. The world had just shifted, like a door on its hinges. A few days ago, his causal betrothal had been that of a powerful man to a relatively minor scion of a distant house. Now, Shallan might be the most important person in the world, and he was . . . What was he? He raised his lantern, then made a few marks in chalk on the wall to indicate he'd been here. This tower was huge. How did the entire thing stay up? They could probably explore in here for months without opening every door. He had thrown himself into the duty of exploration because it seemed like something he could do. It also, unfortunately, gave him time to think. He didn't like how few answers he came up with. He turned around, realizing he'd gotten far from the rest of his scouting party. He was doing that more and more often. The first groups from the Shattered Plains had started arriving, and they needed to decide where to house everyone. Were those voices ahead? Adolin frowned, then continued down the corridor, leaving his lantern behind so it wouldn't give him away. He was surprised when he recognized one of the speakers down the hallway. Was that Sadeas? It was. The highprince stood with a scouting party of his own. Silently, Adolin cursed the wind that had persuaded Sadeasof all peopleto heed the call to come to Urithiru. Everything would have been so much easier if he'd just stayed behind. Sadeas gestured for a few of his soldiers to go down one branch of the tunnellike corridor. His wife and a few of her scribes went the other way, two soldiers trailing. Adolin watched for a moment as the highprince himself raised a lantern, inspecting a faded painting on the wall. A fanciful picture, with animals from mythology. He recognized a few from children's stories, like the enormous, minklike creature with the mane of hair that burst out around and behind its head. What was it called again? Adolin turned to go, but his boot scraped stone. Sadeas spun, raising his lantern. "Ah, Prince Adolin." He wore white, which really didn't help his complexionthe pale color made his ruddy features seem downright bloody by comparison. "Sadeas," Adolin said, turning back. "I wasn't aware that you had arrived." Storming man. He'd ignored Father all those months, and now he decided to obey? The highprince strolled up the hallway, passing Adolin. "This place is remarkable. Remarkable indeed." "So you acknowledge that my father was right," Adolin said. "That his visions are true. The Voidbringers have returned, and you are made a fool." "I will admit," Sadeas said, "there is more fight left to your father than I'd once feared. A remarkable plan. Contacting the Parshendi, working out this deal with them. They put on quite a show, I hear. It certainly convinced Aladar." "You can't possibly believe it was all a show." "Oh please. You deny that he had a Parshendi among his own guard? Isn't it convenient that these new 'Radiants' include the head of Dalinar's guard and your own betrothed?" Sadeas smiled, and Adolin saw the truth. No, he didn't believe this, but it was the lie he would tell. He would start the whisperings again, trying to undermine Dalinar. "Why?" Adolin asked, stepping up to him. "Why are you like this, Sadeas?" "Because," Sadeas said with a sigh, "it has to happen. You can't have an army with two generals, son. Your father and I, we're two old whitespines who both want a kingdom. It's him or me. We've been pointed that way since Gavilar died." "It doesn't have to be that way." "It does. Your father will never trust me again, Adolin, and you know it." Sadeas's face darkened. "I will take this from him. This city, these discoveries. It's just a setback." Adolin stood for a moment, staring Sadeas in the eyes, and then something finally snapped. That's it. Adolin grabbed Sadeas by the throat with his unwounded hand, slamming the highprince back against the wall. The look of utter shock on Sadeas's face amused a part of Adolin, the very small part that wasn't completely, totally, and irrevocably enraged. He squeezed, choking off a cry for help as he moved to pin Sadeas back against the wall, grabbing the man's arm with his own. But Sadeas was a trained soldier. He tried to break the hold, taking Adolin by the arm and twisting. Adolin kept hold, but lost his balance. The two of them fell in a jumble, twisting, rolling. This wasn't the calculated intensity of the dueling grounds, or even the methodical butchery of the battlefield. This was two sweating, straining men, both on the edge of panic. Adolin was younger, but he was still bruised from the fight with the Assassin in White. He managed to come up on top, and as Sadeas struggled to yell, Adolin slammed the man's head down against the stone floor to daze him. Breathing in gasps, Adolin grabbed his side knife. He plunged the knife toward Sadeas's face, though the man managed to get his hands up to grab Adolin by the wrist. Adolin grunted, forcing the knife closer, clutched in his off hand. He brought the right in anyway, the wrist flaring with pain, as he leaned it against the crossguard. Sweat prickled on Sadeas's brow, the knife's tip touching the end of his left nostril. "My father," Adolin said with a grunt, sweat from his nose dripping down onto the blade of the knife, "thinks I'm a better man than he is." He strained, and felt Sadeas's grip weaken. "Unfortunately for you, he's wrong." Sadeas whimpered. With a surge, Adolin forced the blade up past Sadeas's nose and into the eye socketpiercing the eye like a ripe berrythen rammed it home into the brain. Sadeas shook for a moment, blood pooling around the blade as Adolin worked it to be certain. A second later, a Shardblade appeared beside Sadeashis father's Shardblade. Sadeas was dead. Adolin stumbled back to not get blood on his clothing, though his cuffs were already stained. Storms. Had he just done that? Had he just murdered a highprince? Dazed, he stared at that weapon. Neither man had summoned his Blade for the fight. The weapons might be worth a fortune, but they'd do less good than a rock in such a closequarters fight. Thoughts coming more clearly, Adolin picked up the weapon and stumbled away. He ditched the Blade out a window, dropping it down into one of the planterlike outcroppings of the terrace below. It might be safe there. After that, he had the presence of mind to cut off his cuffs, remove his chalk mark on the wall by scraping it free with his own Blade, and walk as far away as he could before finding one of his scouting parties and pretending he'd been in that area all along. * * * Dalinar finally figured out the locking mechanism, then pushed on the metal door at the end of the stairwell. The door was set into the ceiling here, the steps running straight up to it. The trapdoor refused to open, despite being unlocked. He'd oiled the parts. Why wasn't it moving? Crem, of course, he thought. He summoned his Shardblade and made a series of quick cuts around the trapdoor. Then, with an effort, he was able to force it to open. The ancient trapdoor swung upward and let him out onto the very top of the tower city. He smiled, stepping onto the roof. Five days of exploration had sent Adolin and Navani into the depths of the citytower. Dalinar, however, had been driven to seek the top. For such an enormous tower, the roof was actually relatively small, and not that encrusted with crem. This high, less rain likely dropped during highstorms and everyone knew crem was thicker in the east than it was in the west. Storms, this place was high. His ears had popped several times while riding to the top, using the fabrial lift that Navani had discovered. She spoke of counterweights and conjoined gemstones, sounding awed by the technology of the ancients. All he knew was that her discovery had let him avoid climbing up some hundred flights of steps. He stepped up to the edge and looked down. Below, each ring of the tower expanded out a little farther than the one above it. Shallan is right, he thought. They're gardens. Each outer ring is dedicated to planting food. He did not know why the eastern face of the tower was straight and sheer, facing the Origin. No balconies along that side. He leaned out. Distant, so far down it made him queasy, he picked out the ten pillars that held the Oathgates. The one to the Shattered Plains flashed, and a large group of people appeared on it. They flew Hatham's flag. With the maps Dalinar's scholars had sent, it had only taken Hatham and the others about a week of quick marching to reach the Oathgate. When Dalinar's army had crossed that same distance, they'd done so very cautiously, wary of Parshendi attacks. Now that he saw those pillars from this perspective, he recognized that there was one of them in Kholinar. It made up the dais upon which the palace and royal temple had been built. Shallan suspected that Jasnah had tried to open the Oathgate there; the woman's notes said that Oathgates to each of the cities were locked tight. Only the one in the Shattered Plains had been left open. Shallan hoped to figure out how to use the others, though their tests right now showed them to be locked somehow. If she managed to make them work, the world would become a much, much smaller place. Assuming there was anything left of it. Dalinar turned and looked upward, regarding the sky. He took a deep breath. This was why he had come to the top. "You sent that storm to destroy us!" he shouted toward the clouds. "You sent it to cover up what Shallan, and then Kaladin, were becoming! You tried to end this before it could begin!" Silence. "Why send me visions and tell me to prepare!" Dalinar shouted. "Then try to destroy us when we listen to them?" I WAS REQUIRED TO SEND THOSE VISIONS ONCE THE TIME ARRIVED. THE ALMIGHTY DEMANDED IT OF ME. I COULD NO MORE DISOBEY THAN I COULD REFUSE TO BLOW THE WINDS. Dalinar breathed in deeply. The Stormfather had replied. Blessedly, he had replied. "The visions were his, then," Dalinar said, "and you the vehicle for choosing who received them?" YES. "Why did you pick me?" Dalinar demanded. IT DOES NOT MATTER. YOU WERE TOO SLOW. YOU FAILED. THE EVERSTORM IS HERE, AND THE SPREN OF THE ENEMY COME TO INHABIT THE ANCIENT ONES. IT IS OVER. YOU HAVE LOST. "You said that you were a fragment of the Almighty." I AM HIS . . . SPREN, YOU MIGHT SAY. NOT HIS SOUL. I AM THE MEMORY MEN CREATE FOR HIM, NOW THAT HE IS GONE. THE PERSONIFICATION OF STORMS AND OF THE DIVINE. I AM NO GOD. I AM BUT A SHADOW OF ONE. "I'll take what I can get." HE WISHED FOR ME TO FIND YOU, BUT YOUR KIND HAVE BROUGHT ONLY DEATH TO MINE. "What do you know of this storm that the Parshendi unleashed?" THE EVERSTORM. IT IS A NEW THING, BUT OLD OF DESIGN. IT ROUNDS THE WORLD NOW, AND CARRIES WITH IT HIS SPREN. ANY OF THE OLD PEOPLE IT TOUCHES WILL TAKE ON THEIR NEW FORMS. "Voidbringers." THAT IS ONE TERM FOR THEM. "This Everstorm will come again, for certain?" REGULARLY, LIKE HIGHSTORMS, THOUGH LESS FREQUENT. YOU ARE DOOMED. "And it will transform the parshmen. Is there no way to stop it?" NO. Dalinar closed his eyes. It was as he had feared. His army had defeated the Parshendi, yes, but they were only a fraction of what was coming. Soon he would face hundreds of thousands of them. The other lands weren't listening. He'd managed to speak, via spanreed, with the emperor of Azir himselfa new emperor, as Szeth had visited the last one. There had been no succession war in Azir, of course. Those required too much paperwork. The new emperor had invited Dalinar to visit, but obviously considered his words to be ravings. Dalinar hadn't realized that rumors of his madness had traveled so far. Even without that, however, he suspected his warnings would be ignored, as the things he spoke of were insane. A storm that blew the wrong way? Parshmen turning into Voidbringers? Only Taravangian of Kharbranthand now, apparently, Jah Kevedhad seemed willing to listen. Heralds bless that man; hopefully he could bring some peace to that tortured land. Dalinar had asked for more information about how he'd obtained that throne; initial reports indicated he'd stumbled into the position unexpectedly. But he was too new, and Jah Keved too broken, for him to be able to do much. Beyond that, there were sudden and unexpected reports, coming via spanreed, of Kholinar rioting. No straight answers there yet, either. And what was this he heard of a plague in the Purelake? Storms, what a mess this all had become. He would need to do something about it. All of it. Dalinar looked to the sky again. "I have been commanded to refound the Knights Radiant. I will need to join their number if I am to lead them." Distant thunder rumbled in the sky, though there were no clouds. "Life before death!" Dalinar shouted. "Strength before weakness! Journey before destination!" I AM THE SLIVER OF THE ALMIGHTY HIMSELF! the voice said, sounding angry. I AM THE STORMFATHER. I WILL NOT LET MYSELF BE BOUND IN SUCH A WAY AS TO KILL ME! "I need you," Dalinar said. "Despite what you did. The bridgeman spoke of oaths given, and of each order of knights being different. The First Ideal is the same. After that, each order is unique, requiring different Words." The thunder rumbled. It sounded . . . like a challenge. Could Dalinar interpret thunder now? This was a dangerous gambit. He confronted something primal, something unknowable. Something that had actively tried to murder him and his entire army. "Fortunately," Dalinar said, "I know the second oath I am to make. I don't need to be told it. I will unite instead of divide, Stormfather. I will bring men together." The thunder silenced. Dalinar stood alone, staring at the sky, waiting. VERY WELL, the Stormfather finally said. THESE WORDS ARE ACCEPTED. Dalinar smiled. I WILL NOT BE A SIMPLE SWORD TO YOU, the Stormfather warned. I WILL NOT COME AS YOU CALL, AND YOU WILL HAVE TO DIVEST YOURSELF OF THAT . . . MONSTROSITY THAT YOU CARRY. YOU WILL BE A RADIANT WITH NO SHARDS. "It will be what it must," Dalinar said, summoning his Shardblade. As soon as it appeared, screams sounded in his head. He dropped the weapon as if it were an eel that had snapped at him. The screams vanished immediately. The Blade clanged to the ground. Unbonding a Shardblade was supposed to be a difficult process, requiring concentration and touching its stone. Yet this one was severed from him in an instant. He could feel it. "What was the meaning of the last vision I received?" Dalinar said. "The one this morning, that came with no highstorm." NO VISION WAS SENT THIS MORNING. "Yes it was. I saw light and warmth." A SIMPLE DREAM. NOT OF ME, NOR OF GODS. Curious. Dalinar could have sworn it felt the same way as the visions, if not stronger. GO, BONDSMITH, the Stormfather said. LEAD YOUR DYING PEOPLE TO FAILURE. ODIUM DESTROYED THE ALMIGHTY HIMSELF. YOU ARE NOTHING TO HIM. "The Almighty could die," Dalinar said. "If that is true, then this Odium can be killed. I will find a way to do it. The visions mentioned a challenge, a champion. Do you know anything of this?" The sky gave no reply beyond a simple rumble. Well, there would be time for more questions later. Dalinar walked down off the top of Urithiru and entered the stairwell again. The flight of steps opened into a room that encompassed nearly the entire top floor of the tower city, and it shone with light through glass windows. Glass with no shutters or support, some of it facing east. How it survived highstorms Dalinar did not know, though lines of crem did streak it in places. Ten short pillars ringed this room, with another at the center. "Well?" Kaladin asked, turning away from an inspection of one of them. Shallan rounded another; she looked far less ragged than she had when they'd first come to the city. Though their days here in Urithiru had been frantic, some good nights' sleep had served them all quite well. In response to the question, Dalinar took a sphere from his pocket and held it up. Then he sucked in the Stormlight. He knew to expect the feeling of a storm raging inside, as both Kaladin and Shallan had described it to him. It urged him to act, to move, to not stand still. It did not, however, feel like the Thrill of battlewhich was what he had anticipated. He felt his wounds healing in a familiar way. He'd done this before, he sensed. On the battlefield earlier? His arm felt fine now, and the cut on his side barely ached anymore. "It's horribly unfair you managed that on your first try," Kaladin noted. "It took me forever." "I had instruction," Dalinar said, walking into the room and tucking the sphere away. "The Stormfather called me Bondsmith." "It was the name of one of the orders," Shallan said, resting her fingers on one of the pillars. "That makes three of us. Windrunner, Bondsmith, Lightweaver." "Four," a voice said from the shadows of the stairwell. Renarin stepped up into the lit room. He looked at them, then shrank back. "Son?" Dalinar asked. Renarin remained in the darkness, looking down. "No spectacles . . ." Dalinar whispered. "You stopped wearing them. I thought you were trying to look like a warrior, but no. Stormlight healed your eyes." Renarin nodded. "And the Shardblade," Dalinar said, stepping over and taking his son by the shoulder. "You hear screams. That's what happened to you in the arena. You couldn't fight because of those shouts in your head from summoning the Blade. Why? Why didn't you say anything?" "I thought it was me," Renarin whispered. "My mind. But Glys, he says . . ." Renarin blinked. "Truthwatcher." "Truthwatcher?" Kaladin said, glancing at Shallan. She shook her head. "I walk the winds. She weaves light. Brightlord Dalinar forges bonds. What do you do?" Renarin met Kaladin's eyes across the room. "I see." "Four orders," Dalinar said, squeezing Renarin's shoulder with pride. Storms, the lad was trembling. What made him so worried? Dalinar turned to the others. "The other orders must be returning as well. We need to find those whom the spren have chosen. Quickly, for the Everstorm is upon us, and it is worse than we feared." "How?" Shallan asked. "It will change the parshmen," Dalinar said. "The Stormfather confirmed it to me. When that storm hits it will bring back the Voidbringers." "Damnation," Kaladin said. "I need to get to Alethkar, to Hearthstone." He strode toward the exit. "Soldier?" Dalinar called. "I've done what I can to warn our people." "My parents are back there," Kaladin said. "And the citylord of my town has parshmen. I'm going." "How?" Shallan asked. "You'll fly the entire distance?" "Fall," Kaladin said. "But yes." He paused at the doorway out. "How much Light will that take, son?" Dalinar asked. "I don't know," Kaladin admitted. "A lot, probably." Shallan looked to Dalinar. They didn't have Stormlight to spare. Though those from the warcamps brought recharged spheres, activating the Oathgate took a great deal of Stormlight, depending on how many people were brought. Lighting the lamps in the room at the center of the Oathgate was merely the minimum amount needed to start the devicebringing many people partially drained the infused gemstones they carried as well. "I will get you what I can, lad," Dalinar said. "Go with my blessing. Perhaps you will have enough left over to get to the capital afterward and help the people there." Kaladin nodded. "I'll put together a pack. I need to leave within the hour." He ducked from the room into the stairwell down. Dalinar sucked in more Stormlight, and felt the last of his wounds retreat. This seemed a thing a man could easily grow accustomed to having. He sent Renarin with orders to speak with the king and requisition some emerald broams that Kaladin could borrow for his trip. Elhokar had finally arrived, in the company of a group of Herdazians, of all things. One claiming his name needed to be added to the lists of Alethi kings . . . Renarin went eagerly to obey the order. He seemed to want something he could do. He's one of the Knights Radiant, Dalinar thought, watching him go. I'll probably need to stop sending him on errands. Storms. It was really happening. Shallan had walked to the windows. Dalinar stepped up beside her. This was the eastern face of the tower, the flat edge that looked directly toward the Origin. "Kaladin will only have time to save a few," Shallan said. "If that many. There are four of us, Brightlord. Only four against a storm full of destruction . . ." "It is what it is." "So many will die." "And we will save the ones we can," Dalinar said. He turned to her. "Life before death, Radiant. It is the task to which we are now sworn." She pursed her lips, still looking eastward, but nodded. "Life before death, Radiant." "A blind man awaited the era of endings," Wit said, "contemplating the beauty of nature." Silence. "That man is me," Wit noted. "I'm not physically blind, just spiritually. And that other statement was actually very clever, if you think about it." Silence. "This is a lot more satisfying," he said, "when I have intelligent life whom I can render awed, rapt with attention for my clever verbosity." The ugly lizardcrabthing on the next rock over clicked its claw, an almost hesitant sound. "You're right, of course," Wit said. "My usual audience isn't particularly intelligent. That was also the obvious joke, however, so shame on you." The ugly lizardcrabthing scuttled across its rock, moving onto the other side. Wit sighed. It was night, which was normally a good time for dramatic arrivals and meaningful philosophy. Unfortunately for him, there was nobody here upon which to philosophize or visit, dramatically or otherwise. A small river gurgled nearby, one of the few permanent waterways in this strange land. Extending in all directions were rolling hills, furrowed by passing water and grown over in the valleys with an odd kind of briar. Very few trees here, though farther west a true forest sprouted on the slopes down from the heights. A couple of songlings made rattling sounds nearby, and he took out his pipes and tried to imitate them. He couldn't, not exactly. The singing sounds were too like percussion, a zipping rattlemusical, but not flutelike. Still, the creatures seemed to alternate with him, responding to his music. Who knew? Maybe the things had a rudimentary intelligence. Those horses, the Ryshadium . . . those had surprised him. He was glad that there were still some things that could do that. He finally set down his pipes and contemplated. An audience of ugly lizardcrabthings and songlings was some audience, at least. "Art," he said, "is fundamentally unfair." One songling continued to creak. "You see, we pretend that art is eternal, that there is some kind of persistence to it. A Truth, you might say. Art is art because it is art and not because we say that it is art. I'm not going too quickly for you, am I?" Creak. "Good. But if art is eternal and meaningful and independent, why does it depend so damn much upon the audience? You've heard the story about the farmer visiting court during the Festival of Depiction, right?" Creak? "Oh, it's not that great a story. Utterly disposable. Standard beginning, the farmer who visits the big city, does something embarrassing, stumbles into the princess andcompletely by accidentsaves her from getting trampled. Princesses in these stories never do seem to be able to look where they are going. I think perhaps more of them should inquire with a reputable lensmaker and procure a suitable set of spectacles before attempting any further traversal of thoroughfares. "Anyway, as this story is a comedy, the man is invited to the palace for a reward. Various nonsense follows, ending with the poor farmer wiping himself in the privy with one of the finest paintings ever painted, then strolling out to find all of the lighteyes staring at an empty frame and commenting on how beautiful the work is. Mirth and guffaws. Flourish and bow. Exit before anyone thinks too much about the tale." He waited. Creak? "Well, don't you see?" Wit said. "The farmer found the painting near the privy, so assumed it was to be used for such a purpose. The lighteyes found the empty frame in the hall of art, and assumed it to be a masterwork. You may call this a silly story. It is. That does not depreciate its truthfulness. After all, I am frequently quite sillybut I am almost always truthful. Force of habit. "Expectation. That is the true soul of art. If you can give a man more than he expects, then he will laud you his entire life. If you can create an air of anticipation and feed it properly, you will succeed. "Conversely, if you gain a reputation for being too good, too skilled . . . beware. The better art will be in their heads, and if you give them an ounce less than they imagined, suddenly you have failed. Suddenly you are useless. A man will find a single coin in the mud and talk about it for days, but when his inheritance comes and is accounted one percent less than he expected, then he will declare himself cheated." Wit shook his head, standing up and dusting off his coat. "Give me an audience who have come to be entertained, but who expect nothing special. To them, I will be a god. That is the best truth I know." Silence. "I could use a little music," he said. "For dramatic effect, you see. Someone is coming, and I want to be prepared to welcome them." The songling, obligingly, started its music again. Wit took a deep breath, then struck the appropriate poselazy expectation, calculated knowingness, insufferable conceit. After all, he did have a reputation, so he might as well try to live up to it. The air in front of him blurred, as if heated in a ring near the ground. A streak of light spun about the ring, forming a wall five or six feet high. It faded immediatelyreally, it was just an afterimage, as if something glowing had spun in the circle very quickly. In the center of it appeared Jasnah Kholin, standing tall. Her clothing was ragged, her hair formed into a single utilitarian braid, her face lashed with burns. She'd once worn a fine dress, but that was tattered. She'd hemmed it at the knees and had sewn herself a glove out of something improvised. Curiously, she wore a kind of leather bandolier and a backpack. He doubted she'd had either one when her journey had begun. She groaned a long groan, then looked to the side, where Wit stood. He grinned at her. She stabbed her hand out in the blink of an eye, mist twisting around her arm and snapping into the form of a long, thin sword pointed at Wit's neck. He cocked an eyebrow. "How did you find me?" she asked. "You've been making quite a disturbance on the other side," Wit said. "It's been a long time since the spren had to deal with someone alive, particularly someone so demanding as yourself." She hissed out a breath, then pushed the Shardblade closer. "Tell me what you know, Wit." "I once spent the better part of a year inside of a large stomach, being digested." She frowned at him. "That is a thing that I know. You really should be more specific in your threats." He looked down as she twisted her Shardblade, rotating the tip, still pointed at him. "I'd be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me any real threat, Kholin. You can keep waving it about if you want, though. Perhaps it makes you feel more important." She studied him. Then the sword burst to mist, vaporizing. She lowered her arm. "I don't have time for you. A storm is coming, a terrible storm. It will bring the Voidbringers to" "Already here." "Damnation. We need to find Urithiru and" "Already found." She hesitated. "The Knights" "Refounded," Wit said. "In part by your apprentice who, I might add, is exactly seventyseven percent more agreeable than you are. I took a poll." "You're lying." "Okay, so it was a rather informal poll. But the ugly lizardcrabthing gave you really poor marks for" "About the other things." "I don't tell those kinds of lies, Jasnah. You know that. It's what you find so annoying about me." She inspected him, then sighed. "It is part of what I find so annoying about you, Wit. Only a very small part of a vast, vast river." "You only say that because you don't know me very well." "Doubtful." "No, really. If you did know me, that river of annoyance would be an ocean, obviously. Regardless. I know things that you do not, and I think you might actually know some that I do not. That gives us what is called synergy. If you can contain your annoyance, we might both learn something." She looked him up and down, then drew her lips to a line and nodded. She started walking directly toward the nearest town. She had a good sense of direction, this woman. Wit strolled up beside her. "You realize we're at least a week away from civilization. Did you need to Elsecall this far out in the middle of nowhere?" "I was somewhat pressed at the time of my escape. I'm lucky to be here at all." "Lucky? I don't know if I'd say that." "Why?" "You'd likely be better off on the other side, Jasnah Kholin. The Desolation has come, and with it, the end of this land." He looked at her. "I'm sorry." "Don't be sorry," she said, "until we see how much I can salvage. The storm has come already? The parshmen have transformed?" "Yes and no," Wit said. "The storm should hit Shinovar tonight, then work its way across the land. I believe that the storm will bring the transformation." Jasnah stopped in place. "That's not how it happened in the past. I have learned things on the other side." "You are correct. It is different this time." She licked her lips, but otherwise did a good job containing her anxiety. "If it's not happening as it did before, then everything I know could be false. The words of the highspren could be inaccurate. The records I seek could be meaningless." He nodded. "We can't depend upon the ancient writings," she said. "And the supposed god of men is a fabrication. So we can't look to the heavens for salvation, but apparently we can't look toward the past either. So where can we look?" "You're so convinced that there is no God." "The Almighty is" "Oh," Wit said, "I don't mean the Almighty. Tanavast was a fine enough fellowbought me drinks oncebut he was not God. I'll admit, Jasnah, that I empathize with your skepticism, but I don't agree with it. I just think you've been looking for God in the wrong places." "I suppose that you're going to tell me where you think I should look." "You'll find God in the same place you're going to find salvation from this mess," Wit said. "Inside the hearts of men." "Curiously," Jasnah said, "I believe I can actually agree with that, though I suspect for different reasons than you imply. Perhaps this walk won't be as bad as I had feared." "Perhaps," he said, looking up toward the stars. "Whatever else might be said, at least the world chose a nice night upon which to end. . . ."
