Chapter 1
Reﬂections on the
Revolutions

In 1881 the young Oxford historian Arnold Toynbee delivered his Lectures
on the Industrial Revolution, and in so doing made it as distinct a ‘period’
of British history as the Wars of the Roses. This makes it easy, but
misleading, to conceive of an age of the ‘dual revolution’ – political in
France and industrial in Britain. But while the storming of the Bastille
was obvious fact, industrialization was gradual and relative in its impact.
It showed up only in retrospect, and notions of ‘revolution’ made less
sense to the British, who shuddered at the word, than to the Europeans,
who knew revolution at close quarters. A Frenchman was in fact the ﬁrst
to use the metaphor – the economist Adolphe Blanqui in 1827 – and Karl
Marx gave the concept general European currency after 1848.
This makes the historian’s task awkward, balancing what is signiﬁcant
now against what was signiﬁcant then. The ﬁrst directs us to industrial
changes, new processes developing in obscure workshops; the second
reminds us how slowly the power of the pre-industrial elites ebbed, how
tenacious religion proved in the scientiﬁc age. Only around 1830 were
people conscious of substantial and permanent industrial change; it
took another 20 years to convince even the middle class that it had all
been for the better.

1

Statistics and Context
Should there not be a simple factual record of developments? In theory,
yes. But the age of the ‘supremacy of fact’ was so ever-changing and
obsessively individualistic that recording and assessing facts was
another matter. There was no ofﬁcial population Census until 1801;
before then there had been real controversy about whether the
population of Britain was growing or shrinking. Although the Census
subsequently developed into a sophisticated implement of social
analysis, covering occupations and housing conditions, this was as
gradual a process as the systematic mapping of the country, carried out
by the Ordnance Survey in stages between 1791 and the 1860s. The

Nineteenth-Century Britain

ideology of laissez-faire and actual government retrenchment adversely
affected statistical compilation, as fewer goods or businesses were
regulated or taxed. (Continental autocracies were, by comparison,
enthusiastic collectors of data about their little industrial enterprises.)
So controversy still rages over some elementary questions – notably
about whether industrialization did the mass of the people any good.
At this point, modern politics casts its shadow. Toynbee’s
contemporaries agreed with Karl Marx that capitalist industrialization
had, by 1848, failed to improve the condition of the working class. After
1917 Soviet Russia seemed to demonstrate a viable alternative: ‘planned
industrialization’. But the costs of this, in human life and liberty, soon
became apparent and, with the ‘developing world’ in mind, liberal
economists restated the case for industrialization achieved through the
operation of the free market. Even in the short term, they argued, and
faced with the problem of providing resources for investment, British
capitalism had increased both investment and living standards. The
results of this vehement dispute have been inconclusive. They have also
been restricted in their geographical context, considering that British
economic development had direct, and far from fortunate, effects on
Ireland, India, and the Southern States of the USA.
2

Consciousness
If there are problems with statistics and context, there is also the
question of consciousness. Industrialization as a concept was only
germinating in the 1820s. Whatever the governing elite thought about
economic doctrines, as magistrates and landowners their watchword
was stability, their values were still pre-industrial. But by 1829 the trend
to industrialization became, quite suddenly, unmistakable. Only 11 years
after the last of Jane Austen’s novels a raucous new voice pictured the
‘Signs of the Times’ in the Edinburgh Review: ‘We remove mountains,
and make seas our smooth highway; nothing can resist us. We war with
rude nature; and by our resistless engines, come off always victorious,
and loaded with spoils.’ Thomas Carlyle summed up, vividly and
from heroic to economic politics that Sir Walter Scott had described
in the Waverley novels, the planned factory community of Robert
Owen’s New Lanark, the visionary politics of desperate handloom
weavers, the alarm and astonishment shown by European visitors.
Only a few months later, his word was made iron in George
Stephenson’s Rocket.
But can we gain from such images a consistent set of concepts which
are relevant both to us and to the age itself? G. M. Young, its pioneer
explorer, in The Portrait of an Age (1936), saw his actors ‘controlled, and
animated, by the imponderable pressure of the Evangelical discipline
and the almost universal faith in progress’. But Young’s history – ‘the
conversation of the people who counted’ – was pretty elitist history,
which neglected the mass of the people – miners and factory hands,
Irish cotters, and London street arabs – or identiﬁed them solely as
‘problems’. The perception, at its most acute in Leo Tolstoy’s War and
Peace, that great movements stem from millions of individual decisions
reached by ordinary people, was lacking. Few of the British
contemporaries of his French and Russian soldiers shared the views of
‘the people who counted’: as far as we know, only a minority of them

1. ‘A voluptuary under the horrors of digestion’. George IV, as prince of
Wales in 1792, surrounded by evidence of his extravagances – unpaid
gambling debts (despite £161,000 voted by Parliament in 1787 to bail him
out) and visible through the window his opulent London residence of
Carlton House. A cartoon of a favourite victim by James Gillray, 1757–1815,
the most brilliant and merciless of British caricaturists

saw the inside of a church, and from what they wrote and read they had
little enough faith in progress. Yet, however constrained their freedom
of action, the decisions of those subjected to the ‘monstrous
condescension of posterity’ are crucial. We have to attend to them.

The Rule of Law
E. P. Thompson, who coined the phrase above, has argued that a
continuing frame of interpretation did exist: the law. No matter how
partial its administration – and in the eighteenth century this was often
brutally apparent – ‘the rule of law’ was still regarded as a common
possession. This claim remained valid after the industrial impact. In
1832, as a young MP, Thomas Babington Macaulay argued in favour of
power: ‘People crushed by law have no hopes but from power. If laws
are their enemies, they will be enemies to law.’ Let the law ‘incorporate’
new groups, and these would defer to the state system. This philosophy
balanced the ‘revolutionary’ consequences of industrial changes, and
the frequent attempts to create from these a new politics.
The evolution of law, moreover, provided a model for other social and
political changes. ‘The most beautiful and wonderful of the natural laws
of God’, in an Oxford inaugural lecture of 1859, turned out to be
economics, but they might as well have been jurisprudence or geology.
Personal morality, technical innovation, the very idea of Britain: the
equation of law with progress bore all these together on its strong
current.
Among all classes, the old morality – bribery and unbelief, drinking,
wenching, and gambling – gradually became regarded as archaic if not
antisocial. As well as ‘vital religion’, rationalist enlightenment, retailed
from Scotland or France, and cheaper consumer goods indicated that
life could be longer and more reﬁned. Where Samuel Pepys had
regarded his Admiralty subordinates’ wives as legitimate fringe

1772–1847, was a talented amateur artist who lived in modest comfort
in the Lake District, then a notable centre of English intellectual life:
William Wordsworth, Thomas de Quincey, and Thomas Arnold of Rugby
were neighbours. Harden’s paintings convey a perceptive impression of
‘English Biedermeier’ middle-class life

beneﬁts, James Boswell, equally amorous, agonized about his wife and
family, foreshadowing new moral imperatives – whether engendered by
the evils of corruption or slavery, proletarian unrest, the French, or the
wrath of the God so dramatically depicted by William Blake.
The onus of proof was on the status quo. Did it elevate? Did it improve?
The English traveller who, in 1839, was appalled to ﬁnd that the
Hungarians had no sailing boats on their waterways, when their Muslim
neighbours had dhows on the Danube, was typical in regarding this,
whatever the reasons for it – the interests of oarsmen and horsemen,
the free transport entitlement of Hungarian nobles, sheer loathing of
everything Turkish – as a case of ‘sinister interests’ blocking reform and
progress.
6

‘Progress’
Neither ‘progress’ nor the rule of law were inevitable but had to be
fought for, against internal and external enemies: ‘old corruption’ and
new disaffection at home, powerful rivals abroad. Progress meant moral
development, not economic or political manipulation – the values
expressed, say, by the hero of Mrs Craik’s John Halifax, Gentleman
(1857):
Nothing that could be done did he lay aside until it was done; his
business affairs were kept in perfect order, each day’s work being
completed with the day. And in the thousand-and-one little things that
were constantly arising, from his position as magistrate and landowner,

was invariably pursued. In his relations with the world outside, as in his
own little valley, he seemed determined to ‘work while it was day.’ If he
could possibly avoid it, no application was ever unattended to; no duty
left unﬁnished; no good unacknowledged; no evil unremedied, or at
least unforgiven.

The rule of law was an English tradition, but its role as an ideology of
‘efﬁcient’ government had in part been created on Britain’s internal
frontiers. Dragging their country out of its backwardness, the Scots had
used their distinctive legal institutions as instruments for consolidating
landed capital, for exploring and ordering ‘civil society’. In Edinburgh,
Adam Smith, William Robertson, Adam Ferguson, and David Hume
wove economics, history, sociology, and philosophy together with
jurisprudence to produce the complex achievement of the Scots
Enlightenment. Figures such as Patrick Colquhoun, James Mill, and the
‘Edinburgh Reviewers’ transmitted its values south. Ireland’s
contribution was quite different. ‘The law’, Dean Swift had written,
‘presumes no Catholic to breathe in Ireland.’ Protestant law had, by
deﬁnition, to be coercive. Not surprisingly, Ireland saw the creation of
Britain’s ﬁrst state-organized police force, in 1814.

and his general interest in the movements of the time, the same system

Although legal campaigns helped to end the serfdom of Scots colliers
and salt-workers in 1799, and the British Empire’s slave trade in 1807,
Scots and English cottars beneﬁted little from their role in the
‘improvement’ of their countryside. Law was more than ever the tool
of property: a function which uniﬁed the local elites of a still-disparate
society when assault from Europe threatened. The clan chiefs and
lairds who had rallied to the French-backed Charles Edward in 1745 were
now landowners who had no common cause with revolutionaries.
Jacobinism was as alien to them as Jacobitism. But the ensuing use of
law to enforce national solidarity and safeguard economic changes was

Nineteenth-Century Britain

to face it with its most formidable test.

Chapter 2
Industrial Development

A greybeard in 1815, who could remember the panic in London as the
Jacobites marched through Manchester in 1745, would have been struck
by one important international change – the reversal in the positions of
Britain and France. This was not simply the result of over 20 years of war
culminating in victory at Waterloo, but of consistent industrial
development and the take-over of important markets. British blockades
destroyed the economy of the great French seaports: grass grew in the
streets of Bordeaux, and meanwhile Britain annexed something like 20
per cent of world trade, and probably about half the trade in
manufactured goods.

Britain and France
Industrial development did not follow a predetermined, predictable
route to success. The process was gradual and casual. Adam Smith
regarded industry with suspicion; even in the 1820s, economists
doubted whether technology could improve general living standards.
Britain had certainly advanced in the century which followed Gregory
King’s estimate, in 1688, that mining, manufacturing, and building
produced a ﬁfth of the gross national income of England and Wales.
(The British ﬁgure would be less, as it included backward Scotland and
Ireland.) By 1800, estimates put the British ‘manufacturing’ ﬁgure at 25
per cent of national income, and trade and transport at 23 per cent. This
9

sort of growth, however, was not beyond French capabilities. What
marked Britain off were qualitative changes, notably in patterns of
marketing, technology, and government intervention – and, at 33 per
cent of national product in 1800, capitalist agriculture. While revolution
retarded French farming by enhancing peasant rights, in Britain feudal
title became effective ownership, the key to commercial exploitation.
In 1745 France’s population, at 21 million, was double that of Britain.
The French economy, thanks to royal patronage and state control, not
only had a huge output but was technologically inventive and grew as
rapidly as Britain’s. But technology in Britain was developed by new
requirements, while in France it was checked not only by government

Nineteenth-Century Britain

interference but by the bounty of traditional resources. France still
produced ample wood for charcoal; British ironmasters had to turn to
coal. France had a huge woollen industry integrated with peasant
farming; in Britain, enclosure and growing agricultural efﬁciency set
limits to such domestic industries, and encouraged the building of large
industrial plants which needed water or steam power or systematized
production. Above all, Britain had already won the trade war by the
1770s, pushing France out of the Spanish territories, out of India and
Canada – with even the loss of the American colonies soon made good
by the rise of the cotton trade.

Population
In 1801, the ﬁrst ofﬁcial Census found that England had 8.3 million
people, Scotland 1.63 million, Wales 587,000, and Ireland 5.22 million.
This settled the debate on population: it seemed to have risen by about
25 per cent since 1750, a rate of increase 50 per cent greater than the
European norm. Debate still continues about why. The death-rate fell
some time before 1750 (as a result of improved food supplies and better
hygiene, and a diminution in the killing power of epidemics) and this
was then reﬂected in a rising birth-rate as the greater number of
surviving children reached breeding age.
10

In Britain, increased manufacturing activity, and the vanishing of the
family farm, made children a valuable source of income. ‘Away, my
boys, get children,’ advised the agricultural writer Arthur Young, ‘they
are worth more than they ever were.’ In Ireland, population growth
surfed along on a different wave: the landlords who wanted higher
rents, and the cultivation of potatoes from the 1720s on. The latter
increased the nutritive output of a patch of land by a factor of three; the
former realized that a rising population on additional farms meant that
each acre might yield three times its rent. The population consequently
doubled in the 50 years between 1780 and 1831:

A recent calculation has suggested that in the early nineteenth century
British agriculture was 2.5 times more productive than that of France,
itself much more efﬁcient than that of the rest of Europe. The result
was that a population on the move from country to town, and at the
same time increasing, could be fed. In 1801 about 30 per cent of the
mainland British lived in towns, and 21 per cent in towns of over
10,000 population – a far higher percentage than in any north European
country. Industrial towns, however, accounted for less than a quarter of
this ﬁgure. Their inhabitants were outnumbered by the numbers living
in seaports, dockyard towns, and regional centres. London, already a
metropolis without parallel, had around 1.1 millions, over a third of the
entire urban population.
Otherwise, population was still fairly evenly distributed. The counties
11

were still increasing in absolute numbers. The ‘Celtic fringe’ still
accounted for nearly half (45 per cent) of United Kingdom population:
Dublin (165,000) and Edinburgh (83,000) still followed London in
the great towns league; Cork and Limerick were larger than most
manufacturing towns. The complex organization of such regional
centres reﬂected the predominant roles of local gentry, clergy, farmers,
and professional people, and the result of decades of increasing trade.

Trade and Distribution
Trade more than industry still characterized the British economy.
Continental towns were – or had only recently ceased to be – stringently

Nineteenth-Century Britain

controlled, their trade limited and taxed in complex and frustrating
ways. The medieval gates of little German cities still swung shut at
nightfall to keep ‘foreigners’ from their markets. But in Britain, by
contrast, there were scarcely any impediments to internal commerce,
while ‘mercantilist’ governments had positively encouraged the
acquisition of ‘treasure by foreign trade’. The eighteenth century had
seen important changes. Seemingly perpetual war in the Channel and
the attraction of large-scale smuggling, centred on the Isle of Man, had
shifted commerce routes north. Liverpool rose on grain and slaves, then
on cotton; Glasgow on tobacco and linen, then on cotton and
engineering. Gradually, their entrepôt function was being changed by
the opening up of efﬁcient transport links to their hinterland, and its
transformation by manufacturing industry.
Trade and distribution provided the central impulses for industrialization. No other European country had 30 per cent of its population in
towns, to be fed, clothed, and warmed, or controlled such vast overseas
markets. The institutions through which British merchants handled all
this – which the law allowed, if not encouraged, them to set up –
provided a framework in which increases in productivity could be
translated into proﬁt, credit, and further investment. At home, an
expanding ‘respectable class’ provided a market for clothes, cutlery,
12

building materials, and china; this ‘domestic’ demand grew by some 42
per cent between 1750 and 1800. But in the same period the increase in
export industries was over 200 per cent, most of this coming in the
years after 1780.

Coal, Iron, and Textiles
Besides agriculture, three sectors were dominant – coal, iron, and
textiles. The ﬁrst two provided much of the capital equipment,
infrastructure, and options for future development; but textiles made
up over 50 per cent of exports by value in 1750, and over 60 per cent by
1800. Cotton, insigniﬁcant in 1750, was dominant with 39 per cent in
1810. Coal output doubled between 1750 and 1800, as steam pumps
enabled deeper and more productive seams to be mined, and

horse-worked railways bore coal ever-greater distances to water
transport. Iron production, boosted by war demand, by the use of coal
instead of charcoal for smelting, and by the perfecting in the 1780s of
‘puddling’ and ‘rolling’ wrought iron, rose by 200 per cent between
1788 and 1806. But textiles were the power which towed the glider of
industrialization into the air.
Wool had always been England’s great speciality, though linen,
dominant on the Continent, was expanding under government
patronage in Ireland and Scotland. Cotton rose largely through its
adaptability to machine production, and the rapid increase in the supply
of raw material that slavery in the American South made possible. The

Nineteenth-Century Britain

new machinery was primitive. But rising demand meant that resistance
to its introduction by the labour force was overcome. John Kay’s ﬂyshuttle loom (which doubled a weaver’s output), destroyed when he
tried to introduce it in the 1730s, was taken up in the 1770s, along with
James Hargreaves’s hand-operated spinning jenny (a multiple-spindle
wheel) and Richard Arkwright’s water-powered spinning frame. The
last, and the great factories it required, spread from the Derbyshire
valleys to Lancashire and Scotland. Before competition brought prices
down – by two-thirds between 1784 and 1832 – huge fortunes could be
made. Arkwright’s shrewd exploitation of his patent rights brought him
£200,000 and a baronetcy. Sir Robert Peel, calico printer and father of
the future Tory premier, ended up by employing 15,000. Robert Owen
reckoned that between 1799 and 1829 his New Lanark mills netted him
and his partners £300,000 proﬁt after paying a 5 per cent dividend. For
some 20 years a modest prosperity extended, too, to the handloom
weavers, before the introduction of power-looms and the ﬂooding of
the labour market with Irish immigrants and, after 1815, ex-servicemen.
This turned the weavers’ situation into one of the starkest tragedies of
the age.

Engineering and Steam Power
Cotton technology spread to other textiles – speedily to Yorkshire
worsteds, slowly to linen and wool. But it also boosted engineering and
metal construction. Powerful and reliable machinery had to be built to
drive thousands of spindles; mills – tinderboxes otherwise – had to be
ﬁreproofed with metal columns and joists. In 1770, Arkwright used
millwrights and clockmakers to install his mainly wooden machinery at
Cromford. But mill-design and machine-building soon became a
specialized job, with waterwheels of up to 150 horsepower, complex
spinning mules (a powered hybrid of the jenny and the frame, spinning
very ﬁne ‘counts’), and the increased use of steam power.

its rotative version in 1781. By 1800, cotton mills were its chief users, as it
supplied reliable and continuous power for mule spinning. In its turn,
the increasingly sophisticated technology required by the steam engine
enhanced both its further application – to water transport in 1802, to
locomotives in 1804 – and the development of the machine-tool
industry, particularly associated with Henry Maudslay and his invention
of the screw-cutting lathe. This (and its associated invention, the
micrometer) made possible the absolutely accurate machining of parts.
From now on, machines could reproduce themselves and be
constructed in ever-greater complexity. The standards of the
eighteenth-century clockmaker were no longer an expensive skill, but
part of the conventional wisdom of mechanical engineering.

Transport
The creation of a transport infrastructure made for a golden age of civil
engineering, too, as men such as James Brindley, John Smeaton, Thomas
Telford, and John Rennie strove to exploit water-carriage and
horsepower as efﬁciently as possible. In a parallel exploitation of wind
power, sailing ships became so sophisticated that they remained
15

Industrial Development

James Watt patented his separate-condenser steam engine in 1774, and

Map 1. The canal system in the early nineteenth century

competitive with steam until the 1880s. The country’s awful roads were
repaired and regulated, and in some cases built from scratch, by
turnpike trusts, even by government. It took nearly a fortnight to travel
from London to Edinburgh in 1745, two and a half days in 1796, and
around 36 hours by coach or steamer in 1830.
Building on the steady growth of river navigation in the seventeenth
century, ‘dead-water’ canals using pound locks were being built in
Ireland in the 1730s. But it was the duke of Bridgewater’s schemes to link
Manchester with a local coalﬁeld and Liverpool, 1760–71, that showed
the importance of water transport for industrial growth. Bridgewater’s
engineer, Brindley, devised ‘narrow’ canals to prevent water loss in the
‘dry’ Midlands, and during the peace of 1764–72, when money was
managed to link all the major navigable rivers. Such private enterprise
could pay, in the case of the Oxford canal, up to 30 per cent in dividend,
but the average was about 8 per cent. The next boom, in the 1780s,
pushed the system beyond what was commercially feasible, but Britain
now had a transport network without parallel in Europe, while the unity
of ‘improvers’, agricultural and industrial, in this cause overcame many
of the barriers to further co-operation.

Chapter 3
Reform and Religion

The British government did not play, or wish to play, a positive role in
industrialization; as the Corn Laws of 1815 were to show, neither did it
abstain in the interests of laissez-faire. But increasingly it observed
principles which were more or less systematic, and less unfavourable to
industrial capitalists than they were to any other class – except, of
course, landowners, who were frequently capitalists themselves in
mining, transport, and property development. The axioms of William
Blackstone and Edmund Burke: of continuity, the division of powers,
the interpenetration of government, economy, and society – and
above all the notion of government as a self-regulating mechanism –
complemented the mechanics of classical economics, the discoveries
of science, and even the cultivated deism of the upper classes.

Reform
But the ideal required renovation. Corruption and inefﬁciency had taken
their toll at the time of the American War, and although the spectacle
of mob violence – particularly in the Gordon Riots of 1780 – made
respectable reformers more circumspect, reform was an admitted
necessity. The messages of Adam Smith and John Wesley had, in their
various ways, seen to that. The problem was, how could it be kept
within constitutional bounds? Attempts such as the Association
Movement to make politics more principled and symmetrical simply
18

exposed the ramiﬁcations of ‘interest’ and downright corruption. The
‘vast rotten borough’ of Scotland, where only 4,000-odd electors
returned 45 placemen MPs (only 1 man in 114 had the vote, compared
with 1 in 7 in England), got its reward in the patronage distributed by its
‘managers’ the Dundas family, notably in the East India Company and
the Admiralty. Ireland’s ‘free’ Parliament, after 1782, was still an
institution for which no Catholic could vote.
The opinion of the great manufacturing towns had to be articulated
by pressure groups such as the General Chamber of Manufacturers,
because of the gross maldistribution of political power. In 1801 the
700,000 people of Yorkshire had only 2 county and 26 borough MPs,
while the 188,000 people of Cornwall had 2 county and 42 borough
MPs. Dissenters and Catholics were allowed to vote after 1793 but
the impact of politics, and so expensive the business of getting
on in it, that for some exclusion was a positive beneﬁt. Although
their overall numbers were in decline, the elaborate family
relationships of the Quakers (who could not ‘marry out’ and
remain in the sect) underpinned widely scattered enterprises
ranging from iron- and lead-smelting works to banks and railways.
The liberal-minded Unitarians, who ‘believed in one God at most’,
were energetic leaders of provincial enlightenment in science and
education.

The Evangelical Revival
Somewhat different was the Evangelical revival. Populist and traditional
high church in origin, this drew inspiration from the religious heritage of
the seventeenth century – exempliﬁed by John Bunyan, and broadcast
by John Wesley – and from the devotional literature of such as William
Law. In contrast to ‘Old Dissent’ and Calvinist ‘election’, it stressed that
grace was available to those who directed their life by biblical precept. It
was respectable without being exclusive, ecumenical, and diffusely
19

Reform and Religion

could not sit in Parliament. On the other hand, so restricted was

‘enthusiastic’ (many who were to become its severest agnostic and
high-church critics started as devout Evangelicals) – a faith of crisis,
valid against atheistic revolution, unfeeling industrial relationships, and
brutal personal behaviour. William Pitt drank and Charles James Fox
gambled, but both were susceptible to the sort of pressure which
well-placed Evangelicals could exert.

Methodism
The Evangelical revival was politically conservative, yet it soon ﬂowed
into peculiar channels. In 1795 the ‘Society of Methodists’ founded by
Wesley left the Church of England because they could no longer accept

Nineteenth-Century Britain

conventional ordination. Tories they remained, but further Methodist
groups such as the Primitives (who seceded in 1811) became more
autonomous and more radical. Methodism was northern – ‘the real
religion of Yorkshire’: elsewhere the Baptists and Congregationalists
expanded in industrial towns whose elites were frequently Unitarian or
Quaker. George Eliot described dissenting values in her ‘political novel’
about 1832, Felix Holt (1867):
Here was a population not convinced that Old England was as good as
possible; here were multitudinous men and women aware that their
religion was not exactly the religion of their rulers, who might
therefore be better than they were, and who, if better, might alter
many things which now made the world perhaps more painful than it
need be, and certainly more sinful.

‘Vital religion’ accomplished a religious revolution in Wales. In 1800 over
80 per cent of the population still adhered to the established Church
whose mid-eighteenth-century missionary efforts, the ‘circulating
schools’, had increased literacy (in Welsh) and enthusiasm beyond the
point where it could sustain it. Into the vacuum ﬂowed Calvinistic
Methodism and the other nonconformist bodies; by 1851, Wales was
80 per cent chapel-going.
20

In Scotland, the established Presbyterian Church, which controlled
education and poor relief, was practically a subordinate legislature.
Controlled by the landowners and their worldly, liberal clergy, it
was coming under increasing assault not only from independent
Presbyterians, but from those, usually Evangelicals, who wished to
transfer power to the congregations. In Ireland, the dissenting tradition
was initially liberal, its leaders comparing their legal disadvantages
with those of the Catholics. But the events of the 1790s, and the
recrudescence of Evangelical fundamentalism, were ultimately to
intensify the divide between the Protestant north-east and the rest of
the country.

Chapter 4
The Wars Abroad

The French Revolution was greeted with general enthusiasm in Britain.
At worst, it would weaken the old enemy; at best it would create
another constitutional state. Charles James Fox, James Watt, Joseph
Priestley, the young William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge
all celebrated it; Robert Burns was inspired to write ‘Scots wha’ hae’ –
which had obvious contemporary implications. Even the government
was slow to echo Burke’s severe censure in his Reﬂections on the
Revolution in France, published in November 1790, while it still seemed
a modest constitutional movement. Nonetheless, Burke expressed
what the establishment felt, especially when Paris lurched leftwards in
June 1791: remove customary deference and force would rule. Reform
should be permitted only on terms which retained the basic political
structure. Burke both attacked France and dramatized Blackstone’s
defence of the British political system. The establishment became
really alarmed by the Anglo-American radical Tom Paine’s reply, The
Rights of Man (1791–2), with its bold proposals for individualist,
democratic reform. Burke may himself have started what he tried to
avoid. If the Reﬂections sold 18,000 copies in six months, The Rights
of Man sold 200,000 – an incredible total for a society still only
semi-literate. Pamphleteering had not demonstrated this range and
impact since the Civil War.
22

War with France
The government was alarmed by two things above all – the impact of
French notions of ‘self-determination’ on Britain’s Low Country client
states, and the contagion of ideas. The European monarchies, with even
greater grounds for concern, abandoned the gentlemanly rules of
eighteenth-century war in summer 1792 and treated the French as rabid
dogs to be shot. The French reciprocated with the notion of war as a
popular crusade: ‘a nation in arms’. In Britain, the diplomatic threat
worked on the political threat: warnings to France increased the
conviction of some optimistic revolutionaries in Paris that war would
lead to a British revolution. On 1 February 1793 France declared war.
Britain was unprepared. The army had only 45,000 men; scarcely a
different from earlier Anglo-French conﬂicts. The new style of army, the
intensity of the revolutionary attack, the competence of France’s new
commanders: together these put Britain’s allies in trouble from the
start. By 1797 Austria had been knocked out and Britain stood alone
against Bonaparte’s Armée d’Angleterre.
Three things preoccupied the government in those early war years: the
threat of invasion, the cost of the war, and the problem of combating
internal dissension. The French made three invasion attempts, once via
Wales and twice via Ireland. A landing in Pembrokeshire in 1797 found
no support, but in autumn 1798, after the bloody suppression by the
British of Presbyterian and Catholic rebels (30,000 may have died), a
force under General Humbert landed in Mayo and was quickly defeated.
The government hoped to defend the mainland by fortifying the coast
with Martello towers, embodying the Militia (the home defence force),
and extending the Militia Acts to Scotland and Ireland. All this gave
ceaseless headaches to the part-time local ofﬁcials involved. As
subsidies to allies were running into tens of millions by 1795, taxation
had to be increased radically and included, after 1799, the innovation of
23

tenth of the battle-ﬂeet could put to sea. Moreover, the war was quite

an income tax levied at 2s. (10p) in the pound. Finally the government
acted drastically against groups which sought peace or solidarity with
the French. ‘Pitt’s reign of terror’ in 1793–4, supplemented by the local
activities of magistrates, industrialists, and patriotic societies, destroyed
many of the radical societies. The repression was particularly ﬁerce in
Scotland, where Lord Braxﬁeld’s brutal Doric humour arbitrarily upheld
‘the most perfect constitution ever created’.
Braxﬁeld’s sarcasms – on being told by one of his victims that Jesus was
a reformer, his reply was ‘Muckle he made o’ that. He waur hangit
tae!’ – symbolized the end of the upper-class liberalism of the Scottish
Enlightenment. Thirty years of fairly constant repression followed,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

wielded by Pitt’s Scottish lawyer allies, the Dundas family.
In Ireland, the reversal was even more drastic. War led Pitt to pressurize
the Irish Parliament into granting Catholics voting rights in 1793, in an
attempt to win them from enthusiasm for ‘godless’ France. But the nonsectarian radicalism of the United Irishmen rapidly grew. By 1798, it was
countered in Ulster by the ultra-Protestant Orange Lodges and by the
local violence of a Catholic peasantry bitterly resentful at Protestant
privileges, and in part inﬂuenced by French-trained priests imbued with
revolutionary ideals. Shortly before Humbert landed there was a
vicious, though short-lived, outburst in Wicklow, enough to convince
the Protestant ascendancy of its isolation. In 1800 Ireland’s ruling class
followed the example of the Scots in 1707, and entered into political
union with England.

The Effects of War
Apart from the brief interlude of 1801–3, the ‘wars abroad’ lasted until
1815. By then, Britain had spent £1,500 million on war; yet the effects
were ambiguous and curiously limited. The war was soon erased from
popular memory. Britain was an armed camp for much of the time:
there were constant drafts into the militia, and at any stage about a
24

sixth of the adult male population may have been under arms.
Compared with France, few of these actually served abroad, although
many – around 210,000 – died. What was in France a demographic
setback – its population increased by 32 per cent, 1800–50, compared
with Britain’s 50 per cent – had a different, smaller impact on Britain.
Yet British naval supremacy was never challenged after 1805, and
through blockades it destroyed much of French industry, whose most
dynamic sectors were based on the trading ports.
Adam Smith had written that war would distort demand and create a
‘seller’s market’ among certain types of labour. It proceeded to do so.
The iron trade boomed not only in its traditional base of the West
Midlands, but in central Scotland and also in South Wales, where
Merthyr Tydﬁl expanded twenty-fold in population between 1780 and
whose largest mid-eighteenth-century town, Carmarthen, had
contained scarcely 4,000 people. As blockade throttled its rivals,
Britain’s ever more commanding lead in textiles reached the stage
where its manufacturers were clothing French armies. The huge naval
dockyards of Chatham, Portsmouth, and Devonport were further
expanded and became pioneers of mass production. Their creations,
the sailing warships, were dramatically improved; steam power, when it
took over in the 1850s, was almost a lesser revolution.
The navy, in fact, typiﬁed many of government’s problems. The
wretched condition of the sailors provoked mutinies at Spithead and
the Nore in 1797. These had little political content; the mutineers,
however aggrieved, remained overwhelmingly patriotic. They were
dealt with by a mixture of coercion and concession – as indeed were the
well-organized dockyard workers. Elsewhere, government reacted
ambiguously to attempts to remedy working-class distress. The
Combination Laws of 1799 treated trade unions like revolutionary
societies and outlawed them; government also successfully opposed
attempts to secure legal minimum wages and restore older industrial

relationships, even when these were backed by manufacturers (on the
whole smaller ones). Such measures, and the depressions which
resulted from the diversion of investment into government funds and
the trade war, ensured that average real wages stagnated between 1790
and 1814. Yet the relatively generous poor relief scales adopted by many
rural parishes after the 1790s – the so-called Speenhamland system –
continued a traditional entitlement to relief, and undoubtedly mitigated
even sharper social conﬂicts.

Results Overseas
For most of the war Britain avoided European involvement, and paid

Nineteenth-Century Britain

subsidies instead to the members of the various coalitions it assembled,
ﬁrst against revolutionary France, then against Napoleon. This was
simply a reﬁnement of the mercenary principles of eighteenth-century
wars. Only between 1811 and 1814, when Britain sent its own
troops to the Peninsula, did its army take on a European role. The gains
in other areas, however, were immense; Britain’s hold over India was
strengthened, and it achieved effective dominance, through Singapore,
of the Dutch East Indies; it conquered Ceylon between 1795 and 1816,
took over South Africa from the Dutch, and established a claim on
Egypt. Informally, Britain secured a trading hegemony over the former
Spanish colonies of Central and South America.
Although Britain was victorious, the war’s imprint on Europe was
predominantly French. Wherever Napoleon’s armies went, they
left (or their opponents copied) the laws, the measurements, the
administration – and above all the nationalistic ethos – of the
revolution. The map had been totally changed. Before 1789, Britain had
been part of a Continental community. David Hume and Adam Smith
were as much at home in Paris as they were in Edinburgh, and rather
more, perhaps, than they were in London. After 1815, Britain, despite the
economic progress which attracted hundreds of foreign visitors,
remained at a distance from European life.
26

Results at Home
At home, war and depression polarized political ideas into
‘revolutionary’ and ‘loyalist’. ‘Pitt’s reign of terror’, patriotic societies,
and church-and-king mobs pushed democratic thinkers, earlier
commonplace enough, either into obscurity or into alliance with
genuinely oppressed groups like the Irish or the working class. The
‘Jacobin tradition’ became as sensitive to industrial and economic
change as it had been to the ‘evils’ of established government. A diffuse,
volatile blend of everything from anarchism to religious millenarianism,
it continued to mark working-class movements up to and including
Chartism.

governing elite, and the role of repression in exalting state power over

contractual ideas of politics, conjured up its own radical rival.
Evangelicalism, in the hands of William Wilberforce and the Clapham
Sect, aimed at converting the elite; but so too did the reiterated
schemes of Jeremy Bentham, a wealthy lawyer who believed, more or
less, that society could be governed through a set of self-evident
principles analogous to those of economics. Of these, the most easily
grasped was ‘utilitarianism’ – that social action should aim at producing
‘the greatest good for the greatest number’. The sworn foe to all ideals
of ‘social contract’, Bentham opposed the French Revolution, and tried
to interest successive British governments in his schemes, particularly of
law and prison reform. He was probably more successful than he
thought, but frustrations drove him towards the democratic reformers

Nineteenth-Century Britain

and by 1815 he was supporting universal suffrage.
The ‘philosophic radicals’, as Bentham’s disciples were called, offered
the combination of institutional reform with political continuity – and,
after 1815, offered it to both sides, as they built up a following of
moderate working-class leaders. From this stemmed both a centralized
pattern of State action, and a theory of public intervention, which
remained powerfully inﬂuential for the rest of the century.
Benthamite theory saw local authorities raising rates and taking
executive action in appropriately sized districts. They would be
supervised by salaried inspectors reporting to a central board. ‘Old
corruption’ and popular proﬂigacy would thus be supposedly checked;
local responsibility would be retained. But, in fact, the ofﬁcials were
dominant. Bentham and his acolytes, the Mills, father and son, and
Edwin Chadwick, may have been converted to democracy, but they
were reluctant to let the people’s representatives do more than veto the
ofﬁcials’ actions. Not surprisingly, their most spectacular successes
were gained in British India.

28

The Law
Law had shifted into a class pattern. Working men, accustomed to ﬁght
disabilities in the courts, lost traditional rights and had their
independent action constrained. The alarm of the propertied classes
gave teeth to hitherto ineffective sanctions. The ‘making of the English
working class’ was, at least in part, a reaction to a combination of war,
industrialization, and repression: it meant a hostility to inequitable law.
There was little respect for ‘the Thing’ (the undeclared confederacy of
the rich to exhaust the poor) in William Cobbett; practical ignorance of
it in Robert Owen. Even the Benthamites thought the legal
establishment a ‘vast sinister interest’. Although ultimately only the
Irish stood out against it, the triumph of the rule of law, like Waterloo,
proved ‘a damned close-run thing’. It was probably only possible
sustained by a new wave of constitutional agitation.

because popular expectations of it endured long enough to be

Men of England, wherefore plough
For the Lords who lay ye low?

Shrink to your cellars, holes and cells;
In halls ye deck another dwells.
Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see

Shelley, To the Men of England

The post-war Tory government after 1815 encountered a new set of
literary radicals. Coleridge and Wordsworth, gathered to the bosom of
the forces of order, were succeeded by Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe
Shelley. Lord Liverpool’s administration of 1812–27 was in fact a pretty
bourgeois affair, made up of minor gentry, the sons of doctors and
merchants, and even (in the case of George Canning), an actress.
Although condemned as reactionary – which some of its members
certainly were – it sat edgily on the right centre. It was liberal (by the
standards of Restoration Europe) abroad, and conciliatory at home. But
it inherited a fearsome post-war slump and racking industrial tensions,
on top of a war debt to be paid for, and demobilized servicemen to be
30

settled. It was scarcely aided by an able Whig opposition, which
lacerated it through the medium of the new literary reviews, and a rich
culture of popular protest, from the ‘unstamped’ newspapers of Henry
Hetherington and Richard Carlile to the bucolic radicalism of William
Cobbett and the visionary millenarianism of William Blake. The landed
interest pressed for, and obtained, the maintenance of subsidy on grain
through the Corn Law of 1815; this probably staved off, for over a
decade, discontent among those of the working population who tilled
the land. But it was all at a cost. Even more than in 1811–12, the threat to
order came from the new industrial towns, where the end of the postwar boom caused widespread unemployment and a steep fall in wages.
The consciousness of the workers, more of their industrial than of their
class position, had steadily sharpened since 1800, and the local
representatives of government, manufacturers and justices of the

London and the Provinces
Do the fears that these gentry frequently expressed – of Jacobin mobs
baying at their gates – and the explicitly revolutionary ideas of some
leaders of the working classes add up to a real threat to overthrow the
regime, which was only narrowly averted? They might have done, had
action been co-ordinated, had a common economic cause existed to
bind industrial workers to the parliamentary radicals and the skilled
trades of the capital, and had the governing classes really lost their
nerve. But this would have been very difﬁcult to achieve. London was
not an ‘absolute’ capital like Paris; there were few vital levers of power
to be grasped had the London radicals mobilized en masse.
London did not move with the provinces. The parliamentary opposition
disowned and deprecated violence, and the Home Ofﬁce under its
repressive head, Viscount Sidmouth, and his local agents cowed
resistance – but at a price. The climax came in Manchester on 16 August
1819, when the local magistracy ordered the yeomanry to apprehend

speakers at a huge but peaceful reform demonstration in St Peter’s
Fields. The soldiers turned on the crowd and 11 were killed at ‘Peterloo’.
Both the desire of radicals for revenge and the penetration of the radical
movement by government spies and agents provocateurs were
responsible for further outbreaks in the following year – a weavers’
rising in Scotland and the ‘Cato Street conspiracy’ to assassinate the
Cabinet in London. Repression – the gallows and transportation – was
sharp, savage, and effective, but in the long term it strengthened
constitutional resistance and steadily discredited the government.

Social Peril and Salvation

Nineteenth-Century Britain

The government itself looked askance at unbound industrialization.
Moving towards free trade, systematic administration, and a reformed
penal code, it still depended on the agricultural interest, and feared
further working-class violence. Sir Walter Scott, its supporter, regretted
the shift of industry to the towns, since he believed that in country mills
the manufacturer ‘exercised a salutary inﬂuence over men depending
on and intimately connected with him and his prospects’. He probably
had Robert Owen and New Lanark in mind. Propagandizing for selfgoverning industrial communities, Owen wanted to put a brake on
industry and, through spade-cultivation, make agriculture again a great
employer. His ‘new moral world’ ﬁtted into the atmosphere of social
peril and utopian salvation which had been pervasive since the end of
the war:
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesar’s Laurel Crown.
Nought can deform the Human Race
Like to the Armour’s iron brace.
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy bow.

Artisans did not need to understand the artisan genius William Blake’s
32

cosmology to appreciate the message. The future must have seemed to
many as apocalyptic as the huge but minutely detailed and didactic
paintings of John Martin, which had a great vogue as engravings in the
mid-1820s.

The Political Battle
The Whig contribution to the political battle was, however, effective
enough. In 1820 George IV’s attempt to divorce his consort led to the
royal family’s dirty linen being washed in the courts. Henry Brougham,
a leading contributor to the Edinburgh Review, championed Queen
Caroline (not the most promising of martyrs) against king and ministry,
to the plaudits of the public. Then in August 1822 Castlereagh, who as
foreign secretary had managed to extricate Britain from the
himself. The way was open for the more liberal side of the Liverpool
government to show itself.
Castlereagh’s successor at the Foreign Ofﬁce, George Canning, sided
with the American president Monroe in 1823 in guaranteeing the new
republics of South America – and incidentally conﬁrmed Britain’s
privileged access to a vast new market. Two years later the ministry
repealed the anti-radical Six Acts of 1819 and anti-trade union
legislation, and in 1826 it ended the ‘management’ of Scotland by the
Dundases. The duke of Wellington’s administration passed Catholic
Emancipation in 1829. It bowed to Daniel O’Connell’s expert
management of Irish public opinion, and to the threat of a national
uprising when O’Connell was elected as MP for County Clare in 1828 but,
as a Catholic, was debarred from taking his seat.

Parliamentary Reform
Only parliamentary reform remained to be implemented, but here a
direct party issue was involved. Pressure groups – the trade unions, the
33

Roads to Freedom

conservative powers represented in Metternich’s Congresses, killed

Scots, the Irish – could be bought off with judicious concessions.
Reform, however, would mean a triumph for the Whigs, with all that
meant in terms of parliamentary command and patronage. In 1828 the
duke had dug his heels in, under pressure from his ‘Ultras’, but in the
following year they parted from him over Catholic Emancipation.
Meanwhile in the country agitation grew, and the Whigs did not scruple
to encourage their radical rivals. Pressure rose to a peak after the Whigs
under Earl Grey and Lord John Russell won the election which the death
of George IV occasioned in 1830. When their Reform Bill was rejected by
the Lords, well-organized ‘Political Unions’ held monster rallies in the
cities; rioters attacked Nottingham Castle and the bishop’s palace in
Bristol, both seats of anti-Reform peers; in Merthyr riots were followed

Nineteenth-Century Britain

by the execution of a workers’ leader, Dic Penderyn. In April 1832 the
Lords gave way – by nine votes – much to the relief of Grey’s
government, which had shown its otherwise conservative nature by the
brutal suppression of farm labourers’ discontent – the ‘Captain Swing’
riots – in southern England.

Chapter 6
Coping with Reform

Despite the near-revolutionary nature of the reform agitation, the act
of 1832 incorporated the most potentially troublesome sectors of
industrial and commercial power, but did little more. Scotland’s
electorate shot up from 4,579 to 64,447 (a 1,407 per cent increase), but
that of Ireland increased by only 21 per cent; 41 large English towns –
including Manchester, Bradford, and Birmingham – got representation
for the ﬁrst time, but the average size of an English borough electorate –
and these returned almost half (324) of the total of 658 MPs – remained
under 900. The 349 electors of Buckingham still returned as many MPs
as the 4,172 electors of Leeds. England, with 54 per cent of the
population, continued to return 71 per cent of the Commons. Before
1832 it had returned 74 per cent. ‘Virtual representation’, of interests
rather than people, remained a principle, and Parliament continued to
be dominated by the landed interest for almost a further half-century.

The Working Class
Some conservatives now feared a Benthamite assault on the aristocracy
and the Church. But there were few doctrinaires in Parliament, and the
reforming zeal of the Whigs rapidly waned. Humanitarians got their way
in 1833 with the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and the
regulation of children’s work in textile factories by the Factory
Inspectorate. The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, which its architect
35

Edwin Chadwick saw as the basis of a systematic and economical
reconstruction of English local government, remained, however, an
isolated monument – as much hated by the people as were its symbols,
the gaunt Union workhouses or ‘bastilles’.
The Times, too, was loud in abuse of the New Poor Law, feeling perhaps
that philosophical radicalism had gone far enough. For 1834 was a
traumatic year. Ireland was quiet for once, the Whigs edging towards an
understanding with O’Connell, which lasted for the rest of the decade,
but on the mainland the ‘alternative society’ of the still-inchoate
working class reached its apogee. The growth of trade unions, led by
men such as John Doherty; the arguments of the ‘unstamped’ press; the

Nineteenth-Century Britain

frustration of radicals with the Reform Act; the return to politics of
Robert Owen – all combined to produce a project for a Grand National
Consolidated Trades Union which would destroy the capitalist system
through a ‘grand national holiday’ or general strike. After this, society
would be reorganized on a co-operative basis, with money values
calculated in terms of hours of labour performed. Government
counterattacked in March with the victimization of six Dorset
labourers – the ‘Tolpuddle Martyrs’; the GNCTU undertook too many
protests and strikes, which its organizers could not co-ordinate. Owen
pulled out in August and effectively brought the movement to an end.
On 16 October Parliament accidentally burned down; six months earlier
this might have appeared more than simply symbolic.

Local Government Reform
The Whig triumph really came with local government reform. Scottish
burgh councils, hitherto self-elected, were put under a ratepayer
franchise in 1833; reform of the English towns followed two years later.
In the larger towns, Whigs and radicals came into the fruits of ofﬁce,
and by and large stayed there. But the government was now badly split.
In November 1834 the Tories, now under Peel and more or less pledged
to work within the framework of reform, took ofﬁce. A false dawn, this:
36

the Whigs were back in April 1835, but under the deeply conservative
Viscount Melbourne. When they fell from power in 1841 Peel seemed
more acutely to reﬂect the spirit of gradualist reform, an outlook
shared with the young queen’s serious-minded consort, Albert of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

The Anti-Corn Law League
Peel, however, was threatened from two sides. Manufacturers,
concerned at falling proﬁts, demanded lower wages, and believed that
they could only get them if the price of bread was reduced (bread was
the staple diet of the working class – they ate about ﬁve pounds of it per
head per week). This could only be done by permitting the free import
of grain, in other words by repealing the Corn Law of 1815. Radicals,
grabbed the reins. Richard Cobden, a none-too-successful cotton
merchant with transatlantic interests, John Bright, a Quaker carpet
manufacturer from Rochdale, and James Wilson, the Scottish journalist
who founded the Economist in 1843, became leading ﬁgures in the
Anti-Corn Law League, inaugurated at a meeting in Manchester in
October 1838. The League both represented, and in part created, the
commercial-minded individualistic middle class – what the Germans
called (and still call) ‘Manchestertum’. By petitions, demonstrations,
the mobilization of nonconformity, and the imaginative use of the new
penny post, it created a widespread animus against the territorial
aristocracy, and against Peel himself.
Peel had, in fact, followed most of the precepts of political economy in
his public ﬁnance: duties on imports were drastically reduced, the Bank
of England reorganized, railway promotion allowed to have its free
enterprise head (despite the predilection of William Gladstone, the
President of the Board of Trade, for outright nationalization). But the
Leaguers acted with the fury of the desperate. They realized that their
prosperity was borne on the back of an increasingly mutinous labour
37

Coping with Reform

frustrated by Whig backsliding, climbed on to the bandwagon and

force. An extremely unorthodox Manchester cotton-master, the young
German Friedrich Engels, watched the successive waves of discontent
breaking against the mill-walls, and prophesied: ‘The moment the
workers resolve to be bought and sold no longer, when, in the
determination of the value of labour, they take the part of men
possessed of a will as well as of working power, at that moment the
whole Political Economy of today is at an end.’ Engels’s chosen
instruments were the ultimate in economic depressions, and the power
of the organized working class expressed in Chartism.

Chartism

Nineteenth-Century Britain

‘I cares nothing about politics neither; but I’m a chartist’, a London
scavenger told Henry Mayhew, the pioneer social investigator, in 1848.
The People’s Charter, with its celebrated six points – manhood suffrage,
the ballot, equal electoral districts, abolition of property qualiﬁcations
for MPs, payment for MPs, and annual Parliaments – achieved the same
immediate impact as the French Revolution and O’Connell’s campaigns
in Ireland. But this only gave a superﬁcial and episodic unity to an
immensely complex, highly localized movement. Formally it was ultrademocratic (although only as far as men were concerned – a proposal
for female suffrage was an early casualty). In its most dramatic
nationwide phase it was also short-lived, lasting from 1838 to 1842. But
organization, and heterodoxy, bubbled away in the regions, inﬂuenced
by the local economic predicaments, political traditions, and the
character of the leaders. The division between ‘physical-’ and ‘moralforce’ leaders was complicated by attitudes to the established parties,
the drink question, Ireland, property, and education. In Scotland and
the English Midlands, leadership came from small tradesmen with a
sprinkling of business and professional men. In Yorkshire it was militant,
following heavy unemployment and the impact of the New Poor Law,
but participated with the Tories in their campaign for factory reform.
The ‘frontier towns’ of industrial Wales had already seen plenty of
‘collective bargaining by riot’, so it was possibly not surprising that a
38

huge protest demonstration at Newport, on 4 November 1839, ended as
a bloody confrontation with the Military. Fourteen were killed, but
subsequent trials led to transportation to Tasmania, not the gallows.
Peel was more humane and tactful than Melbourne in 1831 or Liverpool
in 1819, and his policy succeeded. The economic boom of 1843 and
1844 sapped Chartism; its last revival in 1848 reﬂected the agony of
Ireland rather than the ambitions of the English artisans, or any desire to
emulate events in Europe. Late Chartism was more experimental and
variegated, as well as more Irish. Feargus O’Connor projected land
settlement schemes, and Owenite and socialist ideas came back, along
with ideas culled from European revolutionaries, many of whom ended
up as exiles in Britain. But however fascinating intellectually the

emigrated. Many former Chartists ended up quite respectably
integrated into mid-Victorian local government and the new provincial

Chapter 7
‘Unless the Lord Build
the City . . .’

In 1832 an appalling cholera epidemic, sweeping through Europe from
the Middle East, killed probably 31,000 in Britain; in 1833 Parliament
voted a £30,000 grant to elementary education, and John Keble
preached at Oxford on ‘national apostasy’. These events merely
coincided with political reform – Parliament spent more time and
money on the stables of Windsor Castle than on the education grant –
but were important determinants of the direction that subsequent state
action took, and the way in which the early Victorians rationalized their
social position.

Housing and Sanitation
Cholera dramatized the problem of rapid urban growth, though its
impact could be as deadly in the countryside. The new industrial towns
were small in area, and densely packed, as walking to work was
universal. Urban land usage accorded with economic power: the
numerically tiny property-owning class, possibly less than 5 per cent of
the population in a cotton town, often occupied 50 per cent of the land
area. Working people lived where factories, roads, canals, and, later,
railways allowed them to. The results were squalid – nineteenth-century
towns smoked and stank – and, for the workers, expensive in terms of
both rent and human life. A tolerable house might take a quarter of a
skilled man’s weekly income, and few families were ever in a position to
41

afford this. As a result, not only did slums multiply in the old inner-city
area – the rookeries of London, the cellar-dwellings of Liverpool and
Manchester, the ‘lands’ of the Scottish burghs, ‘China’ in Merthyr
Tydﬁl – but new regionally speciﬁc types of slum were created by
landlords and speculative builders – the ‘back-to-backs’ of Yorkshire and
the tiny ‘room and kitchen’ or ‘single-end’ ﬂats in which 70 per cent of
Glasgow families lived by 1870.
If housing was bad, sanitation was worse. Better-off citizens could
combine to create commissions to provide water and sewerage, light
the streets, and provide some sort of policing, but if anything, this
worsened the plight of their poorer neighbours. A middle-class area’s

Nineteenth-Century Britain

new water-closets all too often drained into the working class’s water
supply.

Health Reform
Epidemics were the working class’s revenge. Surrounded by masses of
the very poor in the shape of servants and tradespeople (whom they
usually ignored), the wealthy suddenly became intensely vulnerable.
A. C. Tait, a future archbishop of Canterbury, for example, lost ﬁve of his
seven children to scarlet fever in Carlisle in 1856. In 1831 the government
forced local notables to serve on temporary boards of health, in order to
combat cholera. In 1840 Edwin Chadwick, concerned at the numbers
driven into pauperism by the death of the breadwinner and ill-health,
conducted on behalf of the Poor Law Commissioners an Inquiry into the
Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population, published in 1842. As a
result of this, and subsequent agitation, not to speak of the threat of
another cholera outbreak, an act of 1848 gave municipalities powers to
set up local boards of health, subject to three public health
commissioners, among them Chadwick himself. Besides the
Benthamites, other forces had been mobilized – some Chartists and
radicals, but probably more Tories, professional men, and
philanthropists. Exemplifying the movement as a whole was Lord
42

Ashley. The future earl of Shaftesbury could be a prejudiced low-church
Tory – Macaulay referred to his style as ‘the bray of Exeter Hall’ – but he
inherited William Wilberforce’s skills at manipulating public, and elite,
opinion to secure effective government intervention. In the 1840s and
1850s these skills were used to help miners, factory hands, poor
emigrants, and slum-dwellers. Some have argued that administrative
reform took on a dynamic of its own, independent of both
parliamentary action and ideology. ‘The Tory interpretation of history’
(as this view has somewhat unfairly been called) contrasted the power
of ofﬁcials – ‘the men on the spot’ – and enthusiasts like Ashley virtually
to create their own laws, with Parliament’s indifference to social
conditions.

conduct among ofﬁcials varied from department to department, and
between individuals. Some were dedicated to the point of self-sacriﬁce,
others reﬂected the easy-going ethos of a civil service still recruited by
patronage. Anthony Trollope, as a senior ofﬁcial of the Post Ofﬁce, still
found time to hunt twice a week, and to turn out a steady 1.7 novels per
annum – one of which, The Three Clerks (1857), gives an engaging picture
of a backwater of the unreformed civil service, and Trollope’s own sour
observations on its reformers.
As this was the golden age both of ‘local self-government’ and of
professional evolution, the strongest initiatives came from the great
cities, and from a new generation of largely Scottish-trained doctors,
who were making the transition from lowly surgeon-apothecaries into a
self-governing profession. Liverpool appointed the ﬁrst medical ofﬁcer
of health in 1847; the City of London, a ‘square mile’ rich in every variety
of social peril, appointed the dynamic Dr John Simon a year later. By
1854 the appointment of Medical Ofﬁcers of Health was compulsory,
and proved critical in getting the cities not only to undertake major
water, drainage, and slum clearance schemes, but to ensure that
regulations on building and overcrowding were enforced.
43

‘Unless the Lord Build the City . . .’

But this is only a partial explanation of the reform process. Standards of

Education
The new industrial society brought into question the organization of
education. Opinions on this differed: the Evangelical Hannah More
believed that to inculcate religion but preserve order, children should
learn to read but not write. Adam Smith, fearing the intellectually
stultifying impact of the division of labour on the working class, sought
to mitigate it by state education. Although this existed in Scotland, as a
result of the Calvinist reformation of the Kirk, there was no English
equivalent. Before the 1800s, there were grammar schools, frequently
of pre-Reformation origin, independent or ‘adventure’ schools, and
charity schools. These varied enormously in quality, and could never

Nineteenth-Century Britain

accommodate an expanding and youthful population, let alone service
the new urban areas and improve standards. Around 1800, however,
opinion – including even that of George III – swung towards education
as a prophylactic against revolution – partly through the appearance of
new, cheap, and thus seductive forms of teaching. The ‘monitorial’
systems of Joseph Lancaster and Andrew Bell, whereby senior pupils
learned lessons by rote and then instructed their juniors, led directly to
the foundation of the British and Foreign Schools Society in 1808, and
the National Society in 1811. These two attempts at national coverage,
however, coincided with the exacerbation of hostilities between their
respective sponsors, the nonconformists and the established Church;
religious animus continued to take precedence over educational criteria
for nearly a century.
Religious antagonisms in the reform of the endowed, or ‘public’,
schools were internal to Anglicanism, and less ﬁerce. The schools’
condition, peculiarly wretched in the last years of the eighteenth
century, had, improved even before the radical Broad-Churchman
Thomas Arnold began his career at Rugby in 1829. His reforms, in fact,
paralleled the essentially conservative political settlement of 1832, but
lasted far longer. A ‘liberal education’ (Latin and Greek) remained
dominant among those destined for the universities, but it was elevated
44

from a totally meaningless ritual for young aristocrats into the subjectmatter of competitive advancement, through scholarships and, at
Oxford and Cambridge, college fellowships, for middle-class boys. Their
goals were the prizes of subsidized entry into the professions, but their
function was more profound: to act as bell-wethers guiding other boys
from the commercial middle class into a sanitized version of the values
of the territorial aristocracy. By the time he died in 1842, Arnold was
being imitated at the other older public schools, and the movement
proceeded, aided by the expansion of the railway system and, in 1857,
by Thomas Hughes’s remarkably successful Tom Brown’s Schooldays.

Christian Socialism
generation of reformers, many of whom had been educated there.
Unlike the Benthamites, they developed no highly integrated
programme, but rather sought to convert institutions accessible only to
the aristocracy and the Anglican clergy to serve the whole of society.
This ideal of ‘nationalization’ with its corollary, the ‘incorporation’ of the
working class into ‘political society’, was expressed in 1848 by the
Christian Socialist followers of F. D. Maurice – including Tom Hughes – in
their attempt to make the Church of England an arbiter between capital
and labour. They were not alone. In Bradford William Edward Forster, a
young radical woollen manufacturer, formerly a Quaker, wrote:
Unless some concessions be made to these masses, and unless all
classes strive earnestly to keep them better fed, ﬁrst or last there will be
a convulsion; but I believe the best political method of preventing it is
by the middle class sympathising with the operatives, and giving
themselves power to oppose their unjust claims by helping them in
those which are reasonable.

Forster’s wife was the daughter of Arnold of Rugby, the sister of
Matthew Arnold, inspector of schools and poet. The ‘intellectual
45

‘Unless the Lord Build the City . . .’

The remodelling of the public schools provided a paradigm for a new

aristocracy’ of high thinking and moderate reform was already shifting
from Evangelical religion to political intervention.

Oxford Movement and Broad Church
Arnold, the public schools, and most of the politicians belonged to the
Broad Church or liberal Anglican tradition, whose principles envisaged
the Church as partner of the State, a relationship to which theological
doctrine was strictly subordinate. The Evangelicals exalted religious
sanctions, but their simple theology was being corroded by liberal
assaults, which seemed to reach a climax with the Reform Act of 1832.
Clergymen feared that a tide of Benthamite, and hence atheistic, reform

Nineteenth-Century Britain

would be unleashed; John Keble in an Oxford sermon declared a clerical
resistance which would be founded on the apostolic traditions of the
Church of England. ‘Tractarianism’, or the Oxford Movement, did not
oppose liberalism through social reform or through ‘high-church’
ceremonial. It was a conservative, intellectual appeal to Anglican
tradition. After 12 years it split, in 1845, when some of its leaders,
including John Henry Newman (partly in reaction to low-church
persecution, partly out of sheer intellectual conviction), decided that
nothing separated them from Rome, and ‘went over’. Although its
enemies forecast otherwise, the Oxford Movement served to
strengthen the spirit of Anglicanism both through devout laymen such
as W. E. Gladstone and through its inﬂuence on religious education and
architecture.
The Broad Church, being posited on a more sociological appreciation of
religion, was in difﬁculties when it appeared that less than a ﬁfth of the
English attended their parish church. The unique religious Census of
1851 showed that only about 35 per cent of the English population went
to Sunday service, and – although there were intense regional variations
here – half of these ‘sat under’ dissenting ministers. In 1848 and after
the Broad Church Christian Socialists tried energetically to reach out to
working men, but for every working man convinced by the theology of
46

the group’s leader, Maurice, ten were impressed by the novels of his
colleague Charles Kingsley, and many more helped practically by the
work of J. M. Ludlow for the trade unions and E. V. Neale for the infant
co-operative movement.
Anglicans at least possessed a tradition, wealth, and breadth of
manoeuvre denied to the nonconformists. Sectionally divided and always
treated with suspicion by the ruling classes, several of their leaders –
notably Jabez Bunting of the Methodist Conference – tried to integrate
themselves through their conservatism. Political radicalism tended to be
the hallmark of rural or mining area Dissenters – the change in South
Wales was particularly drastic – or of urban elites such as the Unitarians or
campaign, did dissent begin to ﬂex its muscles, align itself with the Liberal
Party, and demand either improvements in its own civic status or – in the
programme of the ‘Liberation Society’ (founded in 1844) – the dismantling
of the established Church. Organized dissent came to play a major – and
troublesome – institutional role within Liberalism, but it was a wasting
asset, as the steady trickle of wealthy nonconformists over to the Church
of England showed.
In Scotland the controversy over patronage came to a head in the ‘ten
years’ conﬂict’ of 1833–43, which ended with the ‘Disruption’ of the
established Kirk and the creation of a new independent ‘Free Church’. The
secular role of the Kirk rapidly crumbled – a statutory Poor Law was
enacted in 1845 – but religious politics continued to obsess the Scots
middle class for the rest of the century.

Chapter 8
‘The Ringing Grooves
of Change’

The 1840s remained, however, a decade of crisis, even in terms of
classical economics. British industry was still dominated by textiles, and
the market for them was both ﬁnite and subject to increasing
competition from America and Europe. The industry was overcapitalized, and the adoption of each new invention meant that the
return on capital decreased; each commercial depression was steeper
and longer lasting than the last. Real wages increased only slowly,
probably not sufﬁciently to counter the precipitate decline of the
handwork trades and the high marginal costs of urban life. To Marx,
surveying Britain through the descriptions of his mill-owning friend
Engels, this was all part of one pattern. Capitalism was doomed to
choke on its own surplus accumulations of capital; its increasingly
underpaid labourers would, in the next economic depression, rise
decisively against it. He would have echoed Shelley’s challenge:
Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number –
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you –
Ye are many – they are few.

In the 1840s events in Ireland seemed to bring the revolution
perceptibly nearer. The potato blight of 1845, 1846, and 1848 destroyed
48

the basis of the country’s population growth; between 1845 and 1850 up
to a million died of the consequences of malnutrition; two million
emigrated between 1845 and 1855. The poor Irish immigrant, prepared
to work for wages far below the English norm, had already been seen as
an explosive force; Carlyle had written in Chartism (1839): ‘Every man
who will take the statistic spectacles off his nose, and look, may discern
in town or country. . . [that] the condition of the lower multitude of
English labourers approximates more and more to the Irish competing
with them in all markets. . .’ That this did not happen was substantially
due to a dramatic industrial development which simultaneously soaked
up surplus supplies of labour and capital and transformed them into a
new and more varied economy. Its principal – and psychologically most
spectacular – instrument was the railway.

Railways of various primitive types had since the early seventeenth
century carried coal from mine to port or river; by 1800 there were
perhaps 200 miles of horse-worked track scattered throughout the
country, built to various gauges and patterns, with wooden and later
with iron rails. Cast iron was used from the 1770s, wrought iron
‘edge-rail’ – much more reliable – from the 1790s. Steam traction then
appeared in two forms: stationary low-pressure engines dragged
wagons up inclines, and light high-pressure ‘locomotive’ engines
moved themselves on the rails. In 1804, Richard Trevithick
demonstrated the locomotive in Wales, and it was soon adopted in the
northern coalﬁeld, where ‘viewers’ like George Stephenson were
building large-capacity edge-railways whose demands stretched the
capabilities of horse traction, as coal production doubled between 1800
and 1825. Throughout Britain by 1830, 375 miles of line, authorized by
Parliament, had been built.
The commercial boom of the mid-1820s gave the next boost, with the
promotion of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Cotton production
49

‘The Ringing Grooves of Change’

The Railways

Map 2. Railways, 1825–1914

had almost doubled between 1820 and 1830, and Manchester’s
population had risen by 47 per cent. Transport of the necessities for
both was checked by the monopolistic Bridgewater Canal; a large-scale
competitor was necessary. Its demands almost exceeded the
technology available: only on the eve of its completion, and under
pressure of an open competition, was an efﬁcient enough locomotive
produced by the Stephensons. The difference between the awardwinning Rocket (1830) and the production-line Patentee (1834), however,
was almost as great as that between the Rocket and its clumsy if reliable
precursor, the Locomotion. Locomotive design did not subsequently
change for half a century.
In the 1830s, railway development was buoyed up by another
London with Birmingham, Manchester, and Brighton. Some of the new
lines were prosperous; others, over-capitalized and faced with penal
land and legal charges, ran into trouble. There were few enough rules in
the early days of joint-stock companies, and the reputation soared of
those who succeeded in turning ‘scrip into gold’, such as George
Hudson, ‘the Railway King’, who controlled a third of the system by
1845. Hudson made his attractive proﬁts by paying the dividends of
existing lines with capital raised for new branches; when the great
mania of the 1840s, which he helped promote, faltered in 1848, he was
exposed and ﬂed the country – but not before mileage had risen to over
8,000, and the network had been extended from Aberdeen to
Plymouth.

Railway Heroes
But the railway age produced its heroes as well: the self-taught
Stephenson and his brilliant son Robert, Joseph Locke, Daniel Gooch,
and the polymath Isambard Kingdom Brunel, whose vast projects – the
seven-foot-gauge Great Western Railway, the pioneer iron-and-screw
steamer Great Britain, and the 18,000 ton sea-leviathan Great Eastern –

fascinated the public as much as they terriﬁed his unfortunate ﬁnancial
backers. ‘What poet-race’, G. K. Chesterton would later ask, ‘shot such
cyclopean arches at the stars?’ Such men – Carlyle called them ‘captains
of industry’ – were more attractive entrepreneurs than the cottonmasters, and Samuel Smiles was subsequently to make them paragons
of ‘self-help’.

Construction and Cost
This new transport system had been created in less than a score of
years, and without any modern construction techniques. The ‘navvies’ –
of whom 250,000 were said to be at work in 1848, powered by beer and
52

beef – created the huge earthworks which characterized early British
railways. The image of the British working man in the 1830s had been of
the pathetic factory slave or starving cotton-weaver. In the 1850s it was
provided by the brawny labourers who ran up the Crystal Palace in six
months, and who were shipped to the Crimea to make good – with
railways and camps – the incompetence of the military. The railways
had cost an unprecedented amount of money, however: by 1849 no less
than £224.6 million had been invested. In 1849 total receipts remained
low at only £11.4 million; although receipts rose by 1859 to £24.4
million, railways were never more than a modest and reliable
investment, and in the case of some companies they were far from that.
Until 1852, they made more money from passengers than freight, and
the subsequent expansion of goods trafﬁc was obtained to a great
the canals, whose owners, having hitherto enjoyed inﬂated proﬁts,
were little inclined to see themselves beggared by competition. By the
mid-1850s, strategic sections of the canal network were in railway
ownership, and trafﬁcs were ruthlessly transferred to rail. Already, in the
most dynamic area of industrial growth, the conspiracy of capitalists
denounced by Adam Smith had become a fact.

Chapter 9
Politics and Diplomacy:
Palmerston’s Years

The railway boom coincided with a dramatic shift in politics. The
harvests of 1842, 1843, and 1844 had been good; grain was plentiful
and costs low. Then in 1845 the harvest was wrecked by bad weather,
and the ﬁrst blights hit the Irish potato crop. The arguments of the
Anti-Corn Law League seemed conﬁrmed. Peel attempted to carry
free trade in Cabinet, failed, and resigned, only to come back when
the Whigs could not form a ministry. In February 1846, he moved a
package of measures abolishing duties on imported corn over three
years. He thus bought – or hoped to buy – the support of the gentry
through grants towards the Poor Law and local police forces. But his
party was deeply split and only a minority supported him when he
was censured on Irish coercion in May. In the ensuing election Russell
came back with a Whig ministry, and Whigs and later Liberals
dominated politics thereafter. Badly weakened by the shift of the
Peelite elite, which included Gladstone, the earl of Aberdeen, and Sir
James Graham, into the ambit of the Whigs, the Tory gentry now
found themselves led by the ex-Whigs Lord Derby and Lord George
Bentinck, and the exotic ex-radical Benjamin Disraeli. The Tories
stood ﬁrm as a party, but held power for only 5 of the next
30 years.

Party Management, Landed Power
There was a greater degree of party management, centred on the new
clubs of St James’s, the Reform and the (Tory) Carlton, both founded in
1832, but to conceive of politics shading from left to right means
imposing the criteria of a later age. National party organizations were as
unknown as party programmes. Public speeches were rare. Leaders –
still predominantly Whig magnates – would drop a few hints to their
closest colleagues, often their relatives, about policy just before
elections (which took place every seven years). Prospective candidates
travelled to likely seats, issued addresses, and canvassed for the support
of local notables, only ‘going to the poll’ if promised respectable
support.

rule. The territorial nobility were impregnable in their many surviving
‘pocket boroughs’. A vote – delivered in public – against, say, Blenheim
Palace at Woodstock was still an almost suicidal move for a local farmer
or tradesman. Counties, likewise, were dominated by the great families.
The medium-sized boroughs were more open but expensive; their
electors sometimes reached the levels of corruption depicted at
Eatanswill in Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers. The newly enfranchised
great towns could sometimes elect active if impecunious men –
Macaulay sat for Leeds – but more often favoured afﬂuent local
businessmen, who usually bore most of the cost of the contest. Some
things, however, remain familiar today: England was more conservative,
the ‘Celtic fringe’ more radical.
Although Wellington’s brief caretaker ministry of 1834 proved the last
occasion on which a duke became ﬁrst minister, power lay with the
landed interest, in which the Whigs were still as well represented as the
Tories, although in many cases the elevation to this status was recent, a
tribute to the ﬂexibility of the elite. Peel and Gladstone – both Oxford
double-ﬁrsts – were only a generation removed from provincial industry

Politics and Diplomacy

Huge expenses made contested elections the exception rather than the

and commerce, and even more remarkable was the rise of Benjamin
Disraeli, adventurer and novelist, stemming from a religion, Judaism,
whose members were only to obtain full civil equality in 1860.

The Services
Ministries spent little time over domestic legislation, but much more
over foreign and service affairs – not surprisingly, since the latter
claimed more than a third of the estimates. Neither navy nor army had
changed much since 1815. The navy bought its ﬁrst steamer, a tug called
the Monkey, in 1822. With enormous reluctance, others were ordered in
1828, the Lords of the Admiralty feeling that ‘the introduction of steam

Nineteenth-Century Britain

is calculated to strike a fatal blow at the supremacy of the Empire’.
Paddles meant a loss of broadside guns, and sailing ships could keep
station for years, so Devonport was still launching all-sail three-deckers
in 1848, although the successful use of screw propulsion on smaller
ships was numbering the days of the sailing ﬂeet. The old long-service
army of about 130,000 men – 42 per cent Irish and 14 per cent Scots in
1830 – poorly paid and wretchedly accommodated, kept the peace in
Ireland and the colonies. In many small campaigns it advanced Britain’s
spheres of inﬂuence and trade in India, and in the ‘Opium War’ of
1839–42 in China, although now on behalf of free-trading merchants
rather than the fading Chartered Companies.

Withdrawal from Europe
Britain’s withdrawal from European commitments was reﬂected, too, in
diplomacy. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Continental conservative
leaders, above all Tsar Alexander I of Russia, tried to establish a system
of co-operation in Europe through regular congresses of the great
powers. But even in 1814 British diplomats preferred security to be
achieved by the traditional means of the balance of power, even if this
meant resurrecting France as a counterweight to Russia. For much of
the time between then and 1848, a tacit Anglo-French entente subsisted,
56

though it was disturbed in 1830 when Catholic Belgium detached itself
from Holland, and looked as if it might fall into the French sphere of
inﬂuence. The solution to this was found in Belgian neutrality, and a new
royal family with close links with Britain – all guaranteed by the Treaty of
London (1839), whose violation by Germany in August 1914 brought the
long peace to an end.
Other problems between Britain and France were less easily settled, as
they were linked with the steady decline of the Turkish Empire, which
Britain wished to maintain as a buffer against Austria and Russia in the
Balkans. For much of this period, the dominant ﬁgure was Viscount
Palmerston, who, coming late into foreign affairs in 1830 at the age of
46, burrowed himself into the grubby premises of the Foreign Ofﬁce in
Whitehall (which at the zenith of its power had a staff of only 45) and
patriotic, but still, within limits, liberal. In 1847, however, the most
celebrated British politician in Europe was not Palmerston but Richard
Cobden, the apostle of free trade. He was feted in capital after capital,
and his hosts were sure of one thing – the conservative monarchies
were doomed, and the day of liberalism would shortly dawn.

The Year of Revolutions
Early in 1848, Marx and Engels drafted the Communist Manifesto in
London, prophesying, on behalf of a small group of German socialists, a
European revolution, to be led by the workers of those countries most
advanced towards capitalism. Paris rose up against Louis Philippe on
24 February, then Berlin, Vienna, and the Italian states erupted. But
Britain did not follow. There was a momentary panic when the Chartists
brought their last great petition to London on 14 April; 10,000 special
constables were sworn in; the telegraphs bought over for the week by
the Home Ofﬁce to stop the Chartists using them. The constables were
potentially more worrying than the Chartists, as middle-class volunteer
forces had spearheaded the Continental risings. But their loyalty was
57

Politics and Diplomacy

stayed there as the dominant force for over 30 years – aggressively

absolute; revolutions were something that happened elsewhere. The
Chartists dispersed from Kennington Common; Parliament laughed the
great petition out.
But there was no repetition of 1793 either. The republican government
in Paris wanted to maintain co-operation with Britain, acted ﬁrmly
against its own radicals, and did not try to export revolution.
Palmerston wanted no change in the balance of power, but favoured
constitutional regimes and an Austrian withdrawal from Italy. This
moderation was scarcely successful, and Britain was unable to
guarantee any of the gains that the liberals brieﬂy made. A combination
of peasant support bought by land reform and Russian aid, which

Nineteenth-Century Britain

crushed Hungary and gave Austria a free hand elsewhere, brought the
anciens régimes back to power – but Austria was now prostrate and the
Russians worryingly dominant in Eastern Europe.

58

Chapter 10
Incorporation

Repeal of the Corn Law, the handling of the 1848 emergency, and the
rapid expansion of the railways not only made the economic situation
more hopeful but underpinned it with a new political consensus. The
agricultural interest had been checked, but its farming efﬁciency
enabled it to ride out foreign competition. At the same time the
bourgeoisie realized that it had both to co-operate with the old elite in
controlling the industrial workers, and to concede enough to the latter
to stave off political explosions. In this context (particularly compared
with textiles), railways, steamers, and telegraphs were all useful and
glamorous – attractive advertisements for industrialization.
Functionally, they brought together land, commerce, and industry. And
they made lawyers in particular very rich.

Gradual Reform
By the 1850s the law ‘incorporated’ the working classes – or, at least,
their leading members. The ‘New Model’ trade unions of skilled
workers, such as the Engineers and the Carpenters, pressed not for
drastic state intervention but for contractual equality. They acted not
through public demonstrations but through diplomatic pressure on MPs
of both parties. Their procedures and iconography rejected the oaths
and mysticism of the old quasi-conspiratorial societies for an almost
pedantic legalism, concerned with defending their respectability at the
top of the working class.
59

Nineteenth-Century Britain

7. An industrialized town depicted in Contrasts (1840), by A. W. N. Pugin, in
which the great Gothic revival architect attacked classical architecture,
religious heterodoxy (the places of worship of no fewer than nine
denominations are shown), and the heartlessness of industrial society with
its grim, machine-like buildings. The gaol in front is a version of Jeremy
Bentham’s ‘Panopticon’

Economic and social theory moved towards the idea of ‘incorporation’.
Classical economics had earlier been subversive and pessimistic: one
strand of it, in the hands of Marx, remained so. But John Stuart Mill in his
Logic of 1840 and his Political Economy of 1848 reconciled utilitarianism
with gradual reform and sympathy for the aims of moderate workingclass leaders. Mill found to his surprise that the Logic, with its substantial
borrowings from the French sociological tradition of Henri de SaintSimon and Auguste Comte, became the orthodoxy of the older
universities, which were recuperating from the traumas of the Oxford
Movement. But the ‘Saint of Rationalism’ himself had, in his enthusiasm
for the English Romantic poets, gone far to make his blend of
utilitarianism, ethical individualism, and reformist ‘socialism’
acceptable to reformers within the establishment, who broadcast it
in the high-minded literary reviews which burgeoned around the
mid-century.

In the eyes of the candidates for political incorporation, ‘the rule of
law’ was far from absolute. A. V. Dicey, who applied the phrase to
60

nineteenth-century government, was himself to write in the 1860s:
‘John Smith qua John Smith cannot be suppressed, but John Smith qua
artisan can.’ But he expected that the extension of the franchise would
end such inequities – as, by and large, it did.

‘Without the Law’
Who then remained ‘without the law’? The Irish had been wounded
too deeply. ‘Repeal of the Union’ was O’Connell’s bequest to a new
generation of patriots. Although the Catholic middle class, like the
Scots, proved anxious to ﬁnd niches in the British establishment, Irish
nationalists were made more aggressive by the famine, and could in
the future count on the aid of their embittered emigrant brethren in
America. Settlers in the colonies may have prided themselves on their
transplanting of British institutions, but as the Colonial Ofﬁce was
High and low churchmen complained when the courts upheld the
vague and all-embracing formulas of the Broad Church establishment.
They could not dislodge it but they could indelibly affect the skyline of
Victorian cities and the practice of piety.
The intellectuals accepted the notion of political and social evolution –
Tennyson’s ‘freedom slowly broadens down / from precedent to
precedent’ – long before Darwin’s Origin of Species appeared in 1859.
Although no friend to liberalism, Carlyle’s commendations of selfreliance and the work ethic gave individualism an almost religious
quality. John Stuart Mill became a pillar of the mid-Victorian Liberal
Party, eccentric only in his desire to extend ‘incorporation’ to the half of
the population whom politics ignored – women (whose slow progress
to civic and legal equality started, however, to accelerate during the
1850s). Two more troubled intellects were difﬁcult to pin down. John
Ruskin, ‘the graduate of Oxford’ whose Modern Painters was the
sensation of 1843, combined reverence for aristocracy with increasingly
subversive views on the economy and the environment; though his
61

aware, settler notions of law found no place for the rights of the natives.

directly political impact was to be minimal compared to that of Owen.
No one savaged the law’s delays and inequities more energetically than
Dickens, yet no one worried more about the results of revolution and
lawlessness. The Circumlocution Ofﬁce, the Tite Barnacles, Jarndyce
versus Jarndyce, were balanced by Slackbridge, Madame Defarge, and
Bill Sikes, though Dicey got it just about right when, on balance, he put
Dickens alongside Shaftesbury as a force pushing public opinion
towards ‘positive’ reforming legislation.

Novels and Ballads
Militant dissent and old radicalism had their own world-view, remote

Nineteenth-Century Britain

from that of the establishment, but its tentacles reached out towards
them. The middle class read ‘industrial novels,’ such as Disraeli’s Sybil,
in the 1840s, anxious about and intrigued by conditions in the great
towns, trying to personalize their problems and reconcile them with
individualist morality. But Mrs Gaskell in Mary Barton and Kingsley in
Alton Locke could not provide any such assurance; the only effective
solution for their most heroic characters was emigration. Dickens’s
savage Carlylean satire on Manchester, Hard Times, wavered and
collapsed when it came to considering any better future for the
inhabitants of Coketown.
But few of the Coketown people had time or money to read about what
the literati thought of their plight, and little enough was known about
what they read, although it was obviously affected by the co-option of
the literary radicals by a middle-class public. Mayhew, the social
investigator of the Morning Chronicle, just about carried on the
journalistic tradition of Cobbett and William Hazlitt into the 1860s;
Dickens, from the same Bohemian milieu, shifted away from it. We
know that the ‘labour aristocracy’ in the trade unions read what their
betters wanted them to read; that the religious kept their Bibles and
their Pilgrim’s Progress; but what of the ‘roughs’, and ‘tavern society’? A
folk tradition survived and developed in the ﬁshing ports, among the
62

weavers, and on the farms. Later in the nineteenth century, an American
professor discovered two-thirds of the great traditional English ballads
still being sung in the ‘Farmtouns’ of north-east Scotland, where the
more plebeian ‘bothy ballads’ acted as a means of spreading
information about farmers among the ploughmen and carters, and the
‘Society of the Horseman’s Word’ conserved a primitive, but effective,
trade unionism.
In his novel Except the Lord (1953) about the mid-Victorian youth of a
radical politician, Joyce Cary takes his hero, Chester Nimmo, into a
fairground tent. A troupe of actors are performing Maria Marten, or the
Murder in the Red Barn, a staple of nineteenth-century melodrama,
loosely based on an actual murder which occurred in 1830 – the eve of
‘Captain Swing’. This was Nimmo’s reaction:

cruellest hurt of many inﬂicted by the rich on the poor. Throughout
the play everything possible was done to show the virtue, innocence
and helplessness of the poor, and the abandoned cruelty, the heartless
self-indulgence of the rich.
And this was one among hundreds of such plays. I have wondered often
how such propaganda failed to bring to England also, as to France, Italy,
Germany, almost every other nation, a bloody revolution, for its power
was incredible. As I say, it was decisive in my own life . . .

Cary, a subtle and historically aware novelist, seems to have sensed here
a resentment and grievance deep enough to be concealed by the
respectability and self-help of formal working-class politics but for
which political ‘incorporation’, the repetitive rows of sanitarily
adequate workmen’s dwellings, the increasingly opulent chapels, the
still-locked Sunday parks, offered no consolation.

The drama that we saw, and that millions had seen, was a story of the

Chapter 11
Free Trade: An Industrial
Economy Rampant

The Great Exhibition of 1851 celebrated the ascendancy of the United
Kingdom in the market-place of the world, though many of the
Continental exhibits, especially those from the German states, gave
British manufacturers pause when the high quality of their technology
was examined. The Exhibition, sponsored by the court and organized by
the aristocracy, reﬂected Britain’s commitment to economic progress
and hence to Liberalism. It touched an enthusiastic nerve in the popular
mind. For many ordinary people, it was the ﬁrst occasion for a visit to
London, an exhausting but exhilarating long day-trip on one of the
special trains which brought visitors from all over the country. The
success of the Exhibition astonished contemporaries. Figures for
attendance were published daily in the press; by the end, over six million
tickets had been sold, and on one day over 100,000 persons visited the
‘blazing arch of lucid glass’, Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace which
housed the Exhibition in Hyde Park. Its substantial proﬁts were later
used to build the museums at South Kensington.
The huge crowds were well behaved and openly monarchic. Members of
the propertied classes congratulated themselves: the nervous, brittle
atmosphere of the 1840s was giving way to the calmer tone of the
1850s, which by the 1860s had become positively self-conﬁdent. A street
ballad sold at the Exhibition emphasized the curious blend of artisan
self-reliance, free-trade internationalism, and monarchic chauvinism
64

which was to deﬁne the language of much of British public life for the
rest of the century:
O, surely England’s greatest wealth,
Is an honest working man. . . .
It is a glorious sight to see
So many thousands meet,
Not heeding creed or country,
Each other friendly greet.
Like children of one mighty sire,
May that sacred tie ne’er cease,
May the blood stain’d sword of War give way
To the Olive branch of Peace.

But hark! the trumpets ﬂourish,
Free Trade

Victoria does approach,
That she may long be spared to us
Shall be our reigning toast.
I trust each heart, it will respond,
To what I now propose –
Good will and plenty to her friends,
And confusion to her foes.

The tone of ballads such as this explains the popularity of Henry Temple,
Lord Palmerston. When Lord Aberdeen’s coalition government of 1852
foundered into war against Russia in the Crimea (1854–6) and then
disintegrated when the ineptitude of the war effort was revealed,
Palmerston emerged from its ruins as prime minister. He held this
post, leading the Liberal coalition, with one short interruption, until
his death in October 1865. Palmerston personiﬁed the bombastic
self-conﬁdence of Britain as the only world power, and succeeded in
being simultaneously an aristocrat, a reformer, a free-trader, an
internationalist, and a chauvinist.
65

The 1851 Consensus
The society which the Great Exhibition of 1851 revealed was given more
statistical analysis in the Census of the same year. Two facts captured
the public imagination. For the ﬁrst time, more people in the mainland
of the United Kingdom lived in towns – albeit often quite small ones –
than in the countryside: a dramatic contrast with the past and with any
other economy. The free-trade movement accompanied rather than
anticipated the commitment of the British economy to manufacturing,
transport, and service industries with an urban base. That dream of the
Liberal Tories of the 1820s, that the economy could be somehow held
in balance between agriculture and industry, was forgotten with the

Nineteenth-Century Britain

free-trade dawn. Agriculture remained easily the largest single industry
and indeed increased its competence and output markedly in the 1850s
and 1860s. But the growth of population was in the towns, and
labourers left the land for the cities.
When agriculture faced its crisis in the 1870s with the opening of the
North American prairies, there were relatively few left to defend it. The
‘Revolt of the Field’ in the 1870s was a motley affair, as out-of-work
labourers struggled to organize themselves as wages fell and
magistrates and farmers brought in the troops to harvest the crops. By
the 1850s, Britain – and especially northern and midland England, south
Wales, and southern Scotland – was thus, through the working of Adam
Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ of world trade rather than by any conscious
political decision, committed to a ride on the roller-coaster of
international capitalism, a ride where the travellers could not see
beyond the rise or dip ahead of them: no one had been there before. An
urban nation had no precedent. Perhaps that was why the British dwelt
so tenaciously on rural images and traditions.
The other statistic of the 1851 Census that caught the attention of
contemporaries was its revelations about religion. It was the only
Census ever to attempt to assess English religious attendance, or the
66

lack of it. There were difﬁculties about the statistics, but the main
emphasis was indisputable and surprising: England and Wales were only
partly church-going, and Anglicans were in only a bare majority of those
who attended. Of a total population of 17,927,609, the church-goers
were:
Church of England
Roman Catholics
Protestant Dissenters

5,292,551
383,630
4,536,265

Of potential church-goers, over 5.25 million stayed at home. The Census
was a triumph for non-Anglicans. Their claim to greater political
representation and attention was now backed by that most potent of all
mid-Victorian weapons, so approved of by Mr Gradgrind, Dickens’s
Lancastrian manufacturer: ‘a fact’.

secular, certainly increasingly non-Anglican in tone. Mid-Victorian
politics reﬂected these tendencies, all of which pointed towards
Liberalism.

Liberalism
Between 1847 and 1868, the Tories (the rump of the party left as
protectionists after the 1846 split) lost six general elections running
(1847, 1852, 1857, 1859, 1865, 1868). It is clear that the Tories lost these
elections; it is less easy to say who won them. Majority governments
relied on support from four main groups: the Whigs, the radicals, the
Liberals, and the Peelites (the followers of Peel in 1846). This support
was always liable to disintegration. The classic mid-Victorian political
pattern was as follows: a coalition government was made up of all or
most of the above groups, compromising and bargaining until they
could agree no more and a point of breakdown was reached: the
government would go out of ofﬁce without dissolving Parliament; the
67

Free Trade

England in the 1850s was thus increasingly urban, perhaps increasingly

Tories would then form a minority government, during which the
non-Tory groups would resolve their differences, defeat the Tories, force
a dissolution, win the general election, and resume power. This overall
pattern explains the minority Tory (Derby/Disraeli) ministries of 1852,
1858–9, and 1866–8.
The political system between 1846 and 1868 thus excluded the Tories
from power, while allowing them occasional periods of minority ofﬁce.
During the same period, the majority coalition ﬁrst formed by Lord
Aberdeen in 1852 gradually fused itself into ‘the liberal party’, though
even when it became regularly referred to by that name in the 1860s it
remained ﬁssiparous and liable to disintegration. At the executive level,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

the Whigs, the Peelites, and Lord Palmerston predominated. To a
considerable extent they ruled on sufferance. That great surge of
middle-class political awareness exempliﬁed in the Anti-Corn Law
League in the 1840s had made it clear to politicians that the old political
structure could be maintained only if it came to terms with middle-class
expectations. The series of great budgets introduced by the Peelite
chancellor of the Exchequer, Gladstone, in the years 1853–5 and
1859–65 went far towards meeting these expectations ﬁscally. The
manufacturing classes wanted free trade: Gladstone saw that they
got it.

‘Free Trade’
‘Free trade’ of course meant much more than simply the abolition of
protective tariffs. ‘Free trade’ or laissez-faire were shorthand terms
exemplifying a whole philosophy of political, social, and economic
organization. John Stuart Mill’s 1848 Principles of Political Economy, the
handbook of mid-Victorian liberalism, put the point in a nutshell:
‘Laisser-faire, in short, should be the general practice: every departure
from it, unless required by some great good, is a certain evil.’ The
presumption was that the State should stand aside. The division which
Mill and others made between ‘the State’ on the one hand and society
68

on the other was based on the assumption that the individual could and
should stand alone. Individualism, self-respect, self-reliance, and the
organization of voluntary and co-operative societies were the keynotes
of mid-Victorian liberalism. Thus the economy should be selfregulating, and individuals, whether consumers or producers, holding
their copies of Samuel Smiles’s Self-Help (1859), should be free to make
what way they could in it.
This view of individualism gained from the widely popular writings of
the social evolutionists. Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859)
was not a bolt from the blue: it ﬁtted naturally into, as well as
transcending, a corpus of writing on evolution. The concept of
evolution, and consequently of ‘progress’, whether on the individual,
national, or global level, came to permeate every aspect of Victorian life
and thought. Because evolution was determined by laws of science (a
obey such laws, not meddle with them. Hence most positivists (such as
Walter Bagehot, editor of the inﬂuential weekly Economist, and Herbert
Spencer, author of many works on sociology) were strong laissez-faire
supporters.

Knowledge Untaxed
If individuals were to make their way productively, they must be
prepared and equipped with knowledge: the availability of knowledge
and the freedom to comment on it was thus central to a liberal society.
Moral choices must be informed choices: self-awareness and selfdevelopment in the context of human sympathy were the themes of
the novels of George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), and her own life was a
testimony to the trials as well as the liberation of the free spirit in
mid-Victorian society.
The abolition in 1855 and 1861 of the ‘Taxes on Knowledge’ (the stamp
duties on newspapers, and the customs and excise duties on paper)
69

Free Trade

view usually described as ‘positivism’), man’s duty was to discover and

epitomized the sort of liberal legislation which was particularly prized.
The repeal of these taxes made possible the phenomenon which was
both the epitome and the guarantor of liberal Britain – the liberal
metropolitan and provincial press. The 1850s and 1860s saw a
spectacular expansion of daily and Sunday newspapers, especially in the
provinces, overwhelmingly liberal in politics and in general outlook. By
1863, there were over 1,000 newspapers in Britain, the vast majority of
very recent foundation. For example, in Yorkshire in 1867, 66 of the 86
local newspapers had been founded since 1853. In London, the Daily
Telegraph, refounded in 1855 as a penny daily and as the ﬂagship of the
liberal press, had a circulation of almost 200,000 in 1871, far
outstripping The Times. The new provincial press took its tone from the

Nineteenth-Century Britain

Telegraph, and that tone was unabashedly and enthusiastically
progressive. A typical example is this leader commenting on
Gladstone’s tour of the Newcastle shipyards in 1862:
When we pull a political pansy for Lord Derby [the Tory leader], and tell
him ‘that’s for remembrance’, it is because the violent fallacies and
frenzies of Protection are not to be forgotten simply because they are
forgiven . . . With ten years’ honour upon her green laurels, and the
French treaty [of free trade signed in 1860] in her hand – the emblem
of future conquests – we have enshrined Free Trade at last in a
permanent seat.

Fiscal policy
By the 1860s, free trade – in its speciﬁc sense of an absence of protective
tariffs – had become a central orthodoxy of British politics, almost as
entrenched as the Protestant succession. The triumph of the classical
political economists was complete, in that the cardinal tenet of their
faith was established as a political principle so widely accepted that only
a deliberately perverse or self-confessedly unreconstructed politician
would deny it. Front-bench Tory politicians quickly took the view that if
their party was again to become a majority party, they must accept that
70

protection was ‘not only dead but damned’, as Disraeli said. Tory
budgets became as impeccably free-trading as Liberal ones.

The Churches
Outside the area of ﬁscal policy, there was less agreement about how far
‘free trade’ should go. Pressure groups within the Liberal movement in
the 1850s and 1860s promoted a large range of ‘negative’ free-trade
measures: the abolition of established Churches, the abolition of
compulsory church rates, the abolition of religious tests for entry into
Oxford and Cambridge and public ofﬁces, the removal of restrictions
upon the transfer or use of land, the end of a civil service based on
patronage. In addition to these, there was in the 1860s a general
movement in the constituencies for further parliamentary reform – a
demand welcomed by many but not all of the Liberal MPs.

the modern sense of the word. It was rather a loose coalition of
complex, interlocking allegiances, the most basic of which was its
commitment to a free-trading economy. Within the coalition nestled
many reforming interests, especially of a religious sort. A great religious
revival in the 1860s added to the number of religious activists within the
Liberal Party, and to the enthusiasm with which they both aired their
opinions and worked for the party’s success. Roman Catholics,
nonconformists, and even secularists found voices within this broadly
based movement for progress – the voices were given a common accent
by their hostility to Anglicanism and the established Church. NonAnglicanism was, throughout the century, perhaps the most important
social reason for voting Liberal.
Paradoxically, however, the leadership of the coalition was uniformly
Anglican, though of a moderate and reforming kind. There was,
therefore, considerable dispute between the leadership of the coalition
and its more militant supporters about the speed of reform. On the
71

Free Trade

The Liberal Party legislating on such matters was not really a ‘party’ in

whole, the leadership – Palmerston, Lord John Russell, Gladstone –
wanted moderate reform which would strengthen the Anglican Church
overall, while the radical rank and ﬁle wanted step-by-step reform which
would lead to the eventual disestablishment of the Anglican Church.
Both groups could thus agree on limited measures such as the abolition
of compulsory church rates while disagreeing on the ultimate ends of
their policies. The crowning success of this sort of approach to politics
was the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Ireland in 1869.

Franchise Reform
The participation of the articulate members of the working classes

Nineteenth-Century Britain

within the Liberal Party, especially at the constituency level, was of
great importance. In the 1830s and early 1840s, the six points of the
Chartists had constituted a demand which, in terms of the politics of the
day, could not be incorporated by the classes holding political power. By
the late 1850s, radical movement for constitutional reform, often led by
ex-Chartists, demanded only changes in the franchise, and of these
enfranchisement of the male head of each household at most
(‘household suffrage’). It was not difﬁcult for political leaders in both
parties, but especially in the Liberal Party, to come to terms with such
requests.
They also had their own reasons for wanting to change the system.
Some Tories wanted to change it because their experience from 1847
onwards showed that they could not win a general election within the
existing system. Some Liberals, including Gladstone and Lord John
Russell, wanted to make marginal extensions to the franchise so as to
include more liberal artisans, sturdy individualists who would support
the Liberals’ programme of retrenchment and reform. Some radicals,
such as John Bright, wanted a ‘household suffrage’ to give a more fullblooded basis to Liberalism, though even they were quick to point out
that they did not want votes given to what was known as ‘the residuum’
(that is, paupers, the unemployed, the ‘thriftless’, men with no
72

property at all). Some Liberals, such as Robert Lowe, radical enough on
ordinary legislation, distrusted any change leading to ‘democracy’, as
they believed the ‘intelligent class’ would be swamped by it. Some
Tories such as the future Lord Salisbury feared a household suffrage
would lead to an attack on property through increased direct taxes such
as the income tax. Some Whigs saw no reason to change a system
which always returned non-Tory Parliaments.
Palmerston reﬂected the views of this last group, and won a great
election victory in 1865 without a pledge to franchise reform. He died
that autumn. Russell, his successor as prime minister, brought in with
Gladstone in 1866 a very moderate reform bill dealing mainly with
towns, on which their ministry broke up, some of their party
withdrawing support because the bill did too much, others because it
did too little. The third of the Derby/Disraeli minority Tory
the pass of the anti-reformers’ position.
Reform of some sort became certain: the Liberals had begun their
customary regrouping when Disraeli unexpectedly announced his
acceptance of a household suffrage amendment: the bill then passed, in
a form a great deal more dramatic and sweeping than the Russell–
Gladstone bill of the previous year. The franchise system of 1832 was
ended: the parameters of urban politics until 1915 were established
(similar voting privileges were granted to men in the counties in
1884–5). In an extremely confused situation in 1868, the Liberals seemed
to reconﬁrm their 1865 election position as the dominant party by
winning the general election with the huge majority of 112.
In fact, the 1867 Reform Act had changed the rules of the political game
in such a way that a majority Tory government again became possible –
but it was to be a Tory government under Disraeli in 1874, which made
no serious attempt to reverse any of the main Liberal achievements of
the previous 30 years, certainly not the centrepiece of free trade.
73

Free Trade

administrations then brought in its own bill for the towns, thus selling

Gladstone’s First Government
The early years of Gladstone’s ﬁrst government (1868–74) were the
culmination of these reforming pressures: by 1874 many of the demands
of mid-century Liberalism were fulﬁlled. In addition to disestablishing
the Irish Church, the Liberals in the 1860s and early 1870s had abolished
compulsory church rates, the ‘taxes on knowledge’, religious tests for
Oxford and Cambridge, and the purchase of commissions in the army;
they had legislated on Irish land, and on education for England and
Scotland; they had opened the civil service to entrance by competition;
and they had made capitalism relatively safe for the investor by
introducing limited liability – all this in addition to their preoccupation

Nineteenth-Century Britain

with free-trade ﬁnance, proper government accounting, minimum
budgets, and retrenchment.
Though there was the usual tug and tussle of political bargaining, this
great reforming surge had not been seriously opposed. Even the
establishment of the Anglican Church – whose defence in toto had been
a central rallying point of Toryism in the ﬁrst half of the century – had
been ended in part clearly and efﬁciently: what had in the 1830s been
merely a radical dream had by the 1870s become reality, and almost
without apparent struggle. The Tories’ ultimate card, the unelected
House of Lords, had been played in only a limited way – to delay repeal
of the paper duties, to delay church rate repeal, the ballot, and the
abolition of religious tests at the universities. The propertied and
labouring classes had collaborated in a great clearing of the decks of the
Liberal ship of State.

Economic Boom
The advent of ‘free trade’ as the prevailing ethos coincided with an
economic boom, lasting from the early 1850s to the early 1870s.
Contemporaries saw the ﬁrst as causing the second; economic
historians have been more sceptical. The removal of tariff barriers
74

8. The Forth Bridge under construction, 1888–9, completing the railway
network, which reached its zenith in the 1890s

ascendancy of ‘free trade’, in its larger sense of a national commitment
to economic progress, was closely related to an entrepreneurial
enthusiasm which all classes seem to have shared.
The mid-century boom was not, in percentage terms, very spectacular,
and it was linked to a mild inﬂation. But it was nonetheless extremely
important, for it seemed to show that the ‘condition of England’
question which had been so much a preoccupation of the 1820–50
period could be solved – was being solved – by market forces working
within the existing social and political structure. Even the distress
caused by the ‘cotton famine’ of the 1860s in Lancashire – when the
cotton mills were cut off by the American Civil War from their traditional
source of raw material, the plantations in the Southern States –
produced little prolonged political reaction, and the propertied classes
congratulated themselves that local initiative and voluntary
subscriptions had seemed to be sufﬁcient to allow the Westminster
government to avoid accepting any direct responsibility for the
75

Free Trade

probably had only a marginal impact on the British economy, but the

sufferings of the Lancastrian work-force (though in fact a government
loan scheme had also been important).
Compared with any other country, the British economy in the period
1850–70 was extraordinary in its complexity and in the range of its
products and activities. It was strong in the basic raw materials of an
early industrial economy – coal and iron – and it increased its world
ascendancy in these two commodities as Continental countries
imported British coal and iron to supply the basic materials for their own
industrialization. An energetic manufacturing sector pressed forward
with a huge range of items, from ships and steam engines through
textiles to the enormous variety of small manufactured goods which

Nineteenth-Century Britain

adorned Victorian houses and, by their export in British ships,
‘Victorianized’ the whole trading world. This intense industrial activity
rested on a sound currency and on a banking system which, though it
had its failures, was comparatively stable and was, especially from the
1870s, gaining an increasingly important role in the economy.

76

Chapter 12
A Shifting Population:
Town and Country

This surge of economic progress produced a nation and an economy
whose preoccupations were by 1870 largely industrial and urban. The
growth of towns, which some had thought in 1851 could hardly be
continued, intensiﬁed. By 1901, only one-ﬁfth of the population of
England and Wales lived in what may be called ‘rural areas’; that is, 80
per cent of the population was urbanized, a far greater proportion than
in any European country, and one which remained little changed until
the 1970s. By 1901, there were 74 towns with over 50,000 inhabitants
and London – ‘the metropolis’ as Victorians called it – grew from 2.3
million in 1851 to 4.5 million in 1911 (or 7.3 million if we include all its
suburbs).
The most rapid growth was not in the already established ‘industrial
revolution’ cities, such as Liverpool and Manchester, but in the clusters
of towns around the industrial heartland, towns such as Salford. These
areas of urban sprawl went to make up what Patrick Geddes, the lateVictorian theorist of town planning, called ‘conurbations’; that is, large
areas of industrial and urban land in which several cities merge to form
what is really a single non-rural unit. By 1911, Britain had seven such
areas, at a time when no European country had more than two. These
were: Greater London (7.3 million), south-east Lancashire (2.1 million),
the West Midlands (1.6 million), West Yorkshire (1.5 million), Merseyside
(1.2 million), Tyneside (0.8 million), and central Clydeside (about 1.5
77

Map 3. Urban population growth, 1841–1911

million) – all this in a nation with a population of only 40 million on the
mainland in 1911. Some towns, such as the iron and steel town of
Middlesbrough, grew from virtually nothing to a population of 120,000
in half a century. Most of these conurbations contained a signiﬁcant
Irish community, and their politics consequently tended to be more
‘orange and green’ than elsewhere. At the end of the century London
and Leeds also absorbed large Jewish communities, the victims of an
Eastern European ‘rural depopulation’ as ferocious as the Irish Famine.

Urban Conditions
Urban growth at this sort of pace was, of course, to be a common
phenomenon in underdeveloped countries in the twentieth century, but
in the nineteenth it had no precedent. It is not easy to generalize about
from the indestructible stone tenements of Glasgow, through the ‘backto-backs’ of Yorkshire and ‘two-up, two-down’ little houses in the
mining towns, often built of poor-quality brick, to the decorous suburbs
of the lower and upper middle classes. A common feature of this
housing was that it was almost all leased or rented – owner-occupiers
were rare, though becoming more common by the end of the century.
Some towns were well planned by civic-minded local councils, with
parks, libraries, concert halls, and baths; others were left to the mercy
of the speculative builder.
These growing towns were dominated by the railways, which created
for the ﬁrst time a nationally integrated economy. They transformed the
centres of towns by the space which their stations and marshalling yards
took up, they made it possible for better-off people to live away from
the town centre by providing cheap transport from the suburbs, and
they covered everything with soot. Filth and noise characterized
Victorian cities – ﬁlth from the trains, the chimneys of factories and
houses, and the horses, noise from the carts and carriages and horses
on the cobblestones. When motor transport began to replace horses in

these towns. Styles and standards of architecture varied enormously,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

9. Victorian eclecticism: Birmingham advertisements at the time of the
1868 general election

the early twentieth century, everyone noticed how relatively quiet and
clean town centres became.
But noise, ﬁlth, and bad housing are relative to what people are
accustomed to: it was only slowly that the demand for improvement in
urban life became a powerful one. For many Victorians, production was
its own justiﬁcation. This view was well expressed by Florence, Lady Bell,
in her book At the Works, a classic study of a classic industrial town,
Middlesbrough, given over to one pursuit and one only – the making
of iron:
In default of a romantic past, of a stately tradition, the fact of this swift
gigantic growth has given to Middlesbrough a romance and dignity of
80

another kind, the dignity of power, of being able to stand erect by its
sheer strength on no historical foundation, unsupported by the
pedestals of Time . . . And although it may not have the charm and
beauty of antiquity, no manufacturing town . . . can fail to have an
interest and picturesqueness all its own . . . Tall chimneys, great
uncouth shapes of kilns and furnaces that appear through the smoke of
a winter afternoon like turrets and pinnacles . . . Twilight and night are
the conditions under which to see an ironmaking town, the pillars of
cloud by day, the pillars of ﬁre by night.

The dynamism of the towns was, in the 20 years after the Great
Exhibition, and partly inspired by the machinery exhibited at it,
mirrored in the countryside. ‘High farming’ – capital spending on
fertilizers, drainage, buildings, farm machinery such as reapers and
argument that free trade spelt doom for the countryside, and led to
considerable modernization, moral as well as physical. Even in the
countryside there were fears for the continuance of traditional religion,
as many turned to nonconformity and some to materialism.

Agricultural Depression
An energetic and aggressive farming generation won the proﬁts which
maintained the sedate, leisured, county society depicted in Trollope’s
novels of Barsetshire. In 1868, 80 per cent of food consumed in the
United Kingdom was still home-produced. But despite ‘high farming’,
many areas, especially in Ireland and Scotland, remained woefully
under-capitalized, the foot-plough and hand-winnowing still being
common in the north and west Highlands in the early twentieth
century.
In the 1870s, a series of bad harvests, the opening of the North
American prairies, faster and cheaper shipping thence and from the
overseas wool-producing areas led to ‘the great depression’. Only milk,

10. The agricultural depression. Farm labourers evicted at Milbourne St
Andrew, Dorset, in 1874, for belonging to Joseph Arch’s National

hay, and straw production were not open to harsh foreign competition.
In particular, the price of grain, the characteristic product of the eastern
side of the country, fell dramatically, but farmers, especially the smaller
ones, were slow to accept the permanence of this fall, or to adapt to the
new demand for dairy products. The pastoral west was less severely
affected.
The signiﬁcance of agriculture in the economy declined as towns grew,
a decline made swifter by the depression: in 1851 agriculture accounted
for 20.3 per cent of the national income, in 1901 only 6.4 per cent, and
the majority of British food and agricultural raw materials such as wool
were imported – a fact which was to be of considerable strategic
importance. Cries for the protection of agriculture received little
response, even within the Tory Party – certainly not to the point of an
alteration to the ﬁscal system of free trade. Some Liberal land
reformers – for whom protection was axiomatically ruled out –
advocated smallholdings (the ‘three acres and a cow’ campaign of
82

1885) as a solution; the establishment of the Crofting Commission
(1886) for the Scottish Highlands, empowered to establish crofting
communities free from landlord interference, was the only substantial
achievement on the mainland, though a notable one in its long-term
results.
The attraction of higher wages for fewer hours in the towns,
mechanization in the 1850s and 1860s, and depression in the last
quarter of the century led to extensive rural depopulation – a great
exodus mostly to the Scottish and English towns, some to the
coalﬁelds (especially in Wales), some to the colonies, some to the army.
Between 1861 and 1901 the decrease in the total of rural male
labourers in England and Wales was just over 40 per cent; the total of
women, less easily employable in the towns, decreased less
countryside, though many unmarried women found their way into
domestic service in the towns aided by such agencies as the Girls’
Friendly Society.

Rural Decay
All this left rural society demoralized and neglected, with the passivity
characteristic of communities in decay. Thomas Hardy’s novels, whose
span of publication (1872–96) covered almost exactly the years of the
agricultural depression, captured majestically the uncontrollable and
distant forces which seemed to determine the fate of the country
communities and their inhabitants. Hardy wrote of country habits and
traditions which had passed away but, though historical in form, the
novels had a contemporary overtone. The Mayor of Casterbridge
described the fate of Michael Henchard, a corn merchant whose failure
to adapt to new methods of trading brought him to ruin. Hardy
observed of him at the moment of his ﬁnancial crash: ‘The movements
of his mind seemed to tend to the thought that some power was
working against him.’ The ‘general drama of pain’ which the Wessex
83

A Shifting Population

dramatically, leaving a marked imbalance of the sexes in the

novels depict was the disintegration of a civilization. Surveying his
novels as a whole in 1895, Hardy observed:
The change at the root of this has been the recent supplanting of the
class of stationary cottagers, who carried on the local traditions and
humours, by a population of more or less migratory labourers, which
has led to a break of continuity in local history, more fatal than any
other thing to the preservation of legend, folk-lore, close intersocial
relations, and eccentric individualities. For these the indispensable
conditions of existence are attachment to the soil of one particular spot
by generation after generation.

Nineteenth-Century Britain

Fortunately, Cecil Sharp, Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser, and other folklore
and folk-song and dance historians recorded something of the quality of
British rural life before it was wholly lost.
The breaking up of country customs was encouraged by Whitehall and
Westminster. Educational measures – for example, the 1872 Scottish
Education Act – worked to Anglicize the Gaelic-speakers of Scotland and
Ireland and the Welsh-speakers of Wales, and to equip the peasantry for
urban life. Between 1850 and 1900 rural change and education policy
dealt those languages a powerful and in Scotland almost a fatal blow. In
Wales, however, local initative secured the teaching of Welsh in schools
from 1889.

Urban–Rural Relations
In some areas, there was a good deal of movement between town
and country, as migrant workers left the towns for the harvest, and
poaching by the inhabitants of small towns in the surrounding
countryside was common. Some industrial workers, especially
coalminers, lived in villages with moors and ﬁelds at their doors, and
their sports, such as whippet and pigeon racing, had rural associations.
Middle-class people took advantage of low land values to buy up a
84

country place. For the ﬁnancially sharp members of the propertied
classes, the countryside became an expensive playground, a place for
‘week-ending’; but for many urban-dwellers in the great cities it became
a remote, even dangerous, place populated by a curious people with
antique accents, clothes, and manners. Oscar Wilde’s comedy, The
Importance of Being Earnest (1895) caught the metropolitan tone:
lady bracknell: . . . land has ceased to be either a proﬁt or a pleasure.
It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up. That’s all
that can be said about land.

about ﬁfteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for
my real income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the

lady bracknell: A country house! . . . You have a town house, I hope?
A girl with a simple, unspoilt nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be
expected to reside in the country.
Nonetheless, the image of a happy rural past lingered in town-dwellers’
minds: regardless of class, whenever they could, they lived in a house
with a garden, and perhaps rented an allotment: they recreated the
country in the town while ignoring the reality of its sufferings.
Architecture and town-planning increasingly reﬂected nostalgia for the
village, culminating in the Bournville experiment of Cadbury’s, the
Quaker employers, and in the ‘Garden City’ movement at the end of the
century.

only people who make anything out of it.

Chapter 13
The Masses and the Classes:
The Urban Worker

The urbanization of the mass of the population and the decline of rural

Nineteenth-Century Britain

areas not surprisingly had profound social consequences for all classes
of the population. The greatest fear of the propertied classes in the ﬁrst
half of the century had been of a revolutionary working class or classes:
that no such class emerged is perhaps the most striking feature of the
second half of the century. Most industrial labourers left no memorial
save the products of their labours: the details of their lives, their
aspirations, hopes, beliefs, likes, dislikes, habits, and enthusiasms are
largely lost. In the empire, detailed reports on all such things were
drawn up with all the efﬁciency of the trained civil servant fascinated by
an alien race, but at home it was only at the end of the century that
systematic observation of the living customs of the British urban poor
began. Mayhew’s impressionistic London Labour and the London Poor: A
Cyclopaedia of the Condition and Earnings of Those that Will Work, Those
that Cannot Work, and Those that Will not Work (1861–2) made a start,
but an unsystematic one, and one which was only episodically followed
up. What we do know suggests highly complex and varied patterns of
life, with regionalism and religion often playing an important part.

Rising Wages, Falling Birth-Rate
The standard of living of some members of the labouring population
began to increase quite fast. Between 1860 and 1914 real wages
86

doubled. The years of particularly rapid growth were the boom years of
1868–74, and the period 1880–96; during the latter period real wages
went up by almost 45 per cent. By the 1880s, for the ﬁrst time in the
century, a signiﬁcant number began to enjoy leisure time. Some money
(though not much) was coming to be available for more than the
essentials of food, housing, and clothing.
Strikingly, this surplus coincided not with a rise but with a fall in the
birth-rate, which affected the propertied classes from the 1870s, the
working classes mirroring their social superiors a little later. The extra
cash was thus not absorbed by extra children. This was a startling and
unprecedented development which falsiﬁed the predictions of the
classical political economists from Thomas Malthus to Marx, that the
through the ‘iron law of wages’ because any surplus wealth would be
absorbed by extra children. Control of family size opened the way to the
relative prosperity of the British working class since the 1880s. How and
why this happened is hardly known. Men and women married later; they
may have made some use of the rather unreliable birth-control devices
popularized from the 1870s; women may have used abortion as a
regular means of birth-prevention.
The term ‘working classes’ (the Victorians almost always used the
plural) of course covered a wide spectrum. Charles Booth’s survey of Life
and Labour of the People in London, begun in the late 1880s, found six
main categories: ‘high-paid labour’, ‘regular standard earnings’, ‘small
regular earnings’, ‘intermittent earnings’, ‘casual earnings’, and what
Booth called the ‘lowest class’. ‘Regular standard earners’ made up the
largest group – as much as the total of the other ﬁve categories put
together – and it was this group of men and women which particularly
reduced the size of their families, saw their real incomes rise, and began
to be aware of their potential power within the economy.

87

The Masses and the Classes

labouring classes were condemned to subsistence levels of living

Trade Unions
The growing prosperity of the ‘regular standard earners’ led them to
join trade unions as a means of safeguarding their gains and of
negotiating for better wages and conditions of work. The unions of the
mid-century were for the most part rather narrowly based ‘new model’
craft unions, made up of men who jealously guarded the privileged and
hard-won ascendancy among their fellow employees given them by
their qualiﬁcations through apprenticeship or their responsibility for
skilled machine-working. The steady demand for skilled labour
reinforced the inﬂuence and status of the craft unions, and some
technical developments, for example in the building of iron ships,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

expanded rather than diminished their importance. In the 1870s and
especially in the 1880s these began to be supplemented to include
many more of the workmen in regular employment. Rising living
standards made this possible, for trade union membership was quite
expensive.
The unions existed not only, or even chieﬂy, for purposes of wage
negotiation, but also for a wide variety of ‘self-help’ beneﬁts and were
closely linked to, and sometimes synonymous with, the Friendly
Societies. The ﬁrst of these beneﬁts for any self-respecting workman
was the burial beneﬁt – the avoidance of a funeral paid for by the
workhouse – but many unions also had sickness and unemployment
beneﬁts, for the State as yet offered no help for victims of temporary
calamity. Still less did it assist those more permanently disadvantaged,
save for the ultimate safety net of the workhouse.
Trade union activity grew in a context which seems most curious to the
post-1945 observer. The 20 years after 1874 were characterized by a
sharp and substantial deﬂation – that is, prices (and, to a lesser extent,
wages) fell. On the other hand, real wages, for those in regular
exployment, rose. But this was hard for trade unionists to come to terms
with: a man will hardly believe that an employer who reduces his wages
88

may still be leaving him better off. The ‘new unionism’ of the 1880s was
thus concerned to defend working-class wages: it was a reaction, as
much as a positive force. It had little ideology except for the concept of
solidarity.
Some socialists played a part in the most publicized strikes of the
period – the strike at Bryant and May’s match factory in 1888, and the
London Dock Strike for the ‘dockers’ tanner’ in 1889, both of which
attracted much middle-class interest, probably because they both
occurred in London under the noses of the radicals. But these were not
typical strikes (indeed the London Dock Strike was not conducted by a
union: the union was formed after the strike ﬁnished); nor should the
role of the ‘socialists’ who led them, such as John Burns, be overGladstonian: Karl Marx and his works were virtually unknown, outside a
small circle, in the country where he had spent almost all his working
life; the writings of the socialist groups which sprang up in the 1880s
reached only a tiny audience. Indeed, the resistance of the working
classes to socialist ideas made them the despair of middle-class
intellectuals.

Football and Cricket
If the trade union was the institutional expression of a growing workingclass self-awareness, shared leisure activities, especially for the male
wage-earner, further encouraged this sense of solidarity. Watching
Association Football – a game founded by public schools and university
amateur clubs, but essentially professional by the mid-1880s – became
the regular relaxation of males (and almost without exception only
males) in industrial towns from Portsmouth to Aberdeen. In the last
quarter of the nineteenth century a football club was established in
every self-respecting industrial town. Some of these teams reﬂected the
religious schisms of the cities (Catholic Celtic and Protestant Rangers in
Glasgow, Catholic Everton and Protestant Liverpool on Merseyside). All
89

The Masses and the Classes

stressed. Most of the trade union leadership remained staunchly

of them encouraged a local patriotism, enthusiasm, and selfidentiﬁcation on the part of the followers, which was the envy of many a
political organizer. Football was the product of a highly organized urban
society: the regularity and complexity of the Cup (from 1871) and
League (from 1888) competitions, the need for sustained as well as
immediate interest, the budgeting for the weekly entrance fee and,
perhaps, train fare to the away match, the large, self-regulating crowds,
all reﬂected a disciplined and ordered work-force, content to pay for its
leisure watching others play for a club organized usually by local
businessmen. Sustaining attention on football (or, in the Borders, South
Wales, and north England, on rugby) over the ‘season’ gave the working
man something of the wider perspective of time familiar to his

Nineteenth-Century Britain

agricultural counterpart from the climatic seasons.
The growing popularity of the much lengthier, more idiosyncratic and
socially integrative game of cricket, organized through the County
Championship from 1873, deﬁes any such simple explanation; it was,
perhaps, a testimony to the survival of individuality despite
industrialization and the division of labour. W. G. Grace, the
Gloucestershire physician whose autocratic command of the pitches
and players of the day allowed him to set many batting, bowling, and
ﬁelding records still hardly surpassed, became almost as much of a
national hero as Fred Archer, the champion jockey in 1874–86. Grace’s
great and much-caricatured beard caused him to be confused in the
popular mind with Lord Salisbury – a confusion probably of some
advantage to the latter.

Travel and Betting
Travel for the working class had hitherto taken place in the context of a
desperate search for new employment or accommodation. By the 1880s
it was starting to be recreational: the trip to the seaside organized
individually or by the ﬁrm on one of the new Bank Holidays became
for many an annual excursion. Resorts – Blackpool, Morecambe,
90

Scarborough, Southend, Eastbourne, Portobello – rose to meet the
demand and to stimulate it further. For the holidays of the working
classes were almost always spent in towns: ‘the beach’ meant the pier,
sideshows, and bathing cabins, backed by hotels, boarding houses, and
shops. Radicals and socialists in the 1890s attempted to broaden this
tradition through rambling and cycling clubs which made trips into the
countryside, but the appeal of these was more to the lower middle class
than to the working class.
The development of a popular press and the rapid nationwide
communication made possible by the electric telegraph encouraged the
other great working-class recreation: betting, especially on horses, and,
through the nascent pools industry, on football. Betting offered the pot
be proﬁtable – though, of course, it rarely was.

Rising Standards of Living
The more prosperous sections of the working classes thus began to
share a little the prosperity and expectations which the industrial
revolution had brought the propertied classes half a century earlier.
Diets improved a little, with meat, milk, and vegetables in addition to
bread, potatoes, and beer. The quality of housing was a little better;
houses and people were cleaner as soap became cheaper and generally
available. Books, photographs, and the odd item of decorative furniture
began to adorn the regularly employed workman’s home.
Respectability, in the sense of having the use of money to demonstrate
some degree of control of living style, some sense of settled existence,
some raising of the horizon beyond the weekly wage packet, became a
goal, encouraged by the spread of hire-purchase companies, which
managed much of the spending of the working classes’ surplus.
The rise in the standard of living of the wage-earning population was
important, but it must be kept in perspective. The second half of the

The Masses and the Classes

of gold at the end of the rainbow: leisure could be fun, but it might also

nineteenth century was punctuated by short-term dislocations of the
economy in each decade. Many contemporaries believed that the years
from the mid-1870s to the mid-1890s constituted a ‘great depression’,
when proﬁts fell. As we have seen, this phrase is certainly true with
respect to agriculture. With respect to industry as a whole, it was a
period of readjustment rather than depression, but for the working
person ‘readjustment’ usually meant misery. It was during the 1880s
that the word ‘unemployment’ was given its modern meaning.

Religion
Religion, in the sense of church-going, played little direct part in the life

Nineteenth-Century Britain

of most of the urban English. ‘It is not that the Church of God has lost
the great towns; it has never had them,’ wrote A. F. Winnington-Ingram
(an Anglican clergyman) in 1896. Protestant Churches both Anglican
and nonconformist were unsuccessful in persuading rural labourers to
continue as church-goers when they entered the towns, and the
Churches failed to reach the majority of those born in towns, despite
the indirect allurements of charitable hand-outs and the provision of
education in Sunday Schools, and the direct approach of missions,
revival crusades, and the Salvation and Church Armies. In London in
1902–3 only about 19 per cent of the population regularly went to
church, and those that did came largely from the socially superior areas.
The ﬁgures would probably be a little better in provincial cities and
considerably better in small towns. Only the Roman Catholics attracted
signiﬁcant working-class attendance: their organization was geared to
this, and they skilfully appealed through church social organizations and
clubs to the Irishness as much as to the Catholicism of their
congregations.
The Scots and Welsh continued pious, and the English working classes
were not wholly ignorant of religion. ‘Rites of passage’ (especially
weddings and funerals) remained popular even when secular
alternatives became available. Nor do non-church-goers appear to have
92

been actively hostile to religion except when it took on a Romish or
ritualistic form and became linked with the abrasive relations between
Irish immigrants and the host community. Rather, especially in the case
of Anglicanism, they resented a religion so obviously linked to the status
and power of the propertied classes. Not going to church, in a society
whose articulate members so strongly advocated the practice, was a
protest as well as a sign of indifference.

The Masses and the Classes

93

Chapter 14
Clerks and Commerce: The
Lower Middle Class

For the middle classes, the decades after 1850 offered a golden age of
expansion. In 1851 the middle class was a fairly small and reasonably
easily identiﬁed group: the professions, business men, bankers, large
shopkeepers, and the like. The gulf between this group and the working
classes was deep. By the end of the century, a far more complex pattern
had emerged. A large, intermediate group, which may be called the
lower middle class, was called into being by economic change. The
service sector of the economy had become much greater and more
complex. As the British economy became gradually as much
commercial as industrial, it created a vast army of white-collar workers
to manage and serve in the retailing, banking, accounting, advertising,
and trading sectors.

A New Class
The direction of industrial enterprises started to pass from a paternal
family tradition to a new class of professional managers, and the
bureaucracies of manufacturing industry grew swiftly. The civil
service, both local and central, began to expand rapidly as
government spent more on new responsibilities, especially on the
education system created by the Act of 1870. Shops, ofﬁces, and
telephone exchanges offered new opportunities for the employment
of women.
94

London was particularly affected by the changes, which created a vast
army of City workers, trained at the new polytechnics, commuting by
train or by the new underground railways from the suburbs being built
on what was then the edge of the city, or from towns such as Croydon
which developed rapidly from the 1870s as dormitories for City clerks.
Suburbanization was the characteristic innovation of city life in the
second half of the century: rows of neat houses, terraced or semidetached, with small gardens, often at both front and rear of the
house, testiﬁed to the successful propertied aspirations of this new
society.

Values
These were families which had done well out of the Liberal age:
responded. It valued merit, competition, respectability, efﬁciency, and
a sense of purpose. It respected achievement, money, and success.
Uncertain of its own position in the social order, it responded to
those conﬁdent of their own right to command: it respected
hierarchy. In this, it differed considerably from the sturdy
individualism of Liberals in the 1850s, sustained by the pre-industrial
ethos of ‘the good old cause’ and the rallying cries of the
seventeenth century; its search for a secure place in the social order
made it the vehicle by which the Conservatives became a party with
a stake in the cities. In some places, particularly in small towns with a
nonconformist tradition such as the market towns of Wales and
Scotland, it ran the town, and the self-conﬁdence this gave it,
together with its nonconformity, helped to keep it Liberal. In large
towns, it tended to act as a collaborating class, offering the
aristocracy and the upper middle class the means of power in
exchange for recognition and status.
The Daily Mail, founded by the Harmsworth brothers in 1896, with its
highly efﬁcient national distribution, soon had the provincial press on
95

Clerks and Commerce

Liberalism called for individual achievement, and this class had

the run, and was the archetypal reading matter for the lower middle
class. Initially liberal-imperialist in tone, it crossed over to the Unionists
during the Boer War. ‘By ofﬁce boys for ofﬁce boys’, Lord Salisbury

Nineteenth-Century Britain

contemptuously remarked of it and its clientele.

96

Chapter 15
The Propertied Classes

The upper middle classes divided into two. Those working in the
professions – doctors, lawyers, the clergy of the established Church, civil
servants of the administrative grade – shared a common background of
education at university and, increasingly, at one of the public schools. In
many towns, they lived more exclusively than in the ﬁrst half of the
century, moving out of the town centre to imposing villas in the
suburbs. The habit of sending children away to boarding school
increased the national outlook of this class and weakened the roots of
its individual members in the localities. The spirit of Arnold of Rugby, as
interpreted and modiﬁed by his successors, pervaded the outlook of the
professions. Educated through a syllabus dominated by Greek, Latin,
and ancient history, moralized at by Broad Church Anglicanism, ‘ﬁtted
for life’ by incessant games (rugby football in the winter, cricket and
athletics in the summer) designed to occupy every idle moment, the
ethos of the professional classes was worthy but sterile. Increasingly
designed to provide men to run an empire, it neglected the needs of an
industrial state.
The manufacturing middle class was to some extent affected by this.
Instead of sending their children early into the family ﬁrm,
manufacturers increasingly sent them into the educational process
designed for the professional classes. Sons of the owners of cotton mills
and shipyards learnt Greek and rugby football, and not, as their German
97

counterparts were doing, science and accounting. Sons educated in this
way often showed little interest in returning to manufacturing life, and
the preservation of the entrepreneurial and manufacturing ethos which
had been one of the chief motors of industrial progress in the ﬁrst half of
the century became increasingly difﬁcult. Such men found commerce
more congenial than industry, and went into the expanding banking
sector where the sweat and gore of the factory ﬂoor and labour
relations were sterilized into columns of ﬁgures.

Financial Services
The British economy came to rely more and more on the competence of

Nineteenth-Century Britain

such men. A huge balance of payments deﬁcit on imports and exports
of commodities began to open (£27 million in 1851, £134 million by 1911).
This was turned into an overall surplus by ‘invisible earnings’ – the
proﬁts of banking, insurance, and shipping, and the income from British
capital invested abroad. Income from services (£24 million in 1851,
£152 million in 1911) and from overseas dividends (£12 million in 1851,
£188 million in 1911) seemed to become the vital elements in British
prosperity, and with them came a middle class whose chief expertise
was in handling money, not men or products.
This important development in British social and economic life was as
unplanned as the earlier phase of manufacturing industrialization. It was
the product of that industrialization in two ways. As the ‘workshop of
the world’ sold its products abroad, it stimulated other economics
which cried out for capital they could not themselves supply.
Competition with such economics, and depression in some sectors of
manufacturing in the 1880s, lowered the rate of proﬁt on British
manufacturing, and the ‘invisible hand’ thus pointed the way to the
expansion of the service industries.

98

The Absorption of ‘Trade’
Again, this tendency must not be exaggerated, nor its novelty overstressed. The easy fusion of land, industry, and commerce was a wellestablished English tradition. It had prevented the aristocracy becoming
a caste in the Continental style, and it had offered the reward of status
to the manufacturer. Some took this reward; others, especially
nonconformists, did not seek it. Manufacturing and manufacturers
remained a powerful force in England. But the primacy of
manufacturers, ‘the monarchy of the middle classes’, so much expected
and feared in the ﬁrst half of the century, did not occur. In part this must
be explained by the extent to which the aristocracy neutralized the
political and social effects of ‘trade’ by absorbing it.

increasingly important within the hierarchy of the Anglican Church and
the universities: the latter now catered largely for them, as the passing
of professional and civil-service examinations became required through
the series of reforms consequent upon the Northcote–Trevelyan Report
of 1854. Respectability, the need to maintain the house, and to pay the
servants and school and university fees, encouraged restriction in the
size of middle-class families from the 1870s; that is, rather earlier than
the same phenomenon among the working classes.

Women
Smaller families were also sought by middle-class women, who were
beginning to expect more from life than the privilege of breeding
children and running the household. Women, thus partially liberated,
played an important role in charities, churches, local politics, and the
arts, especially music. With great difﬁculty, some forced themselves
upon the universities (they were allowed to attend lectures and take
examinations, but not degrees), and from the late 1870s women’s
colleges were founded at Oxford, Cambridge, and London. The

seemed, however, the nearest most women could get to a professional
career.

100

Chapter 16
Pomp and Circumstance

The aristocracy (and gentry) was only partly affected by these changes.
Of the three great classes in British social life, it probably changed the
least in Victoria’s reign. The aristocracy was, as the socialist writer
Beatrice Webb observed, ‘a curiously tough substance’. It continued to
wield considerable political power, supplying much of the membership
of both political parties at Westminster, occupying almost all the upper
posts in the empire, running local government in the counties, and
ofﬁcering the army – the navy was less socially exclusive. The aristocracy
and gentry gained from prosperous farming in the 1850s–1870s, and lost
by the agricultural depression; but it recovered some of its losses by
skilful investment in urban land, and by the windfall of urban expansion,
when what had been agricultural lands of declining value made their
owners wealthy as suburbs were built upon them.
The British aristocracy had always been involved in industrialization,
especially in the development of mining, canals, and railways. It now
shrewdly associated itself with the new wave of commercial expansion:
most banks and insurance companies had a lord to add tone to the
managerial board. It also shored up its fortunes by astute marriages,
notably with the new aristocracy of wealth in the United States: the
best-known example was the marriage of the ninth duke of
Marlborough to Consuelo Vanderbilt. By these means, many of the
great aristocratic estates were preserved despite agricultural decline.
101

But they were playthings as much as engines of wealth, and came to be
treated as such. The aristocracy came to be known to the urban
population chieﬂy through their representation in the popular press and
magazines as men and women of leisure: racing, hunting, shooting, and
ﬁshing in the country, gambling and attending the season in London. In
a population for which leisure was becoming increasingly important,
this did not make the aristocracy unpopular.

The Court
The court led the way. The gravity which Albert applied to court life in
the south was applied with equal pertinacity to the serious business of

Nineteenth-Century Britain

recreation in the north. Victoria and Albert’s development of Balmoral
on Deeside in the 1850s, their obvious and highly publicized enjoyment
of peasant life and lore, and their patronage of Sir Edwin Landseer, the
hugely popular artist of rural slaughter, made Scotland respectable, and
likewise similar moors and mountains in the north and west of England
and in Wales. The court linked itself to the Romantic movement, now in
its declining and consequently most popular phase, and by doing so
re-established its popularity and represented the control of nature by an
urban civilization. The Monarch of the Glen, Landseer’s portrait of a stag,
one of the most reproduced of all Victorian paintings, is not monarch of
all he surveys, but a stag at bay, within the gun sights of the stalker: no
glen was safe, nature was tamed.
Victoria and Albert’s life at Balmoral was enjoyable but high-minded:
duty to the peasantry was consistently emphasized. The Prince of
Wales, Victoria’s son Edward who succeeded her in 1901, was merely
hedonistic. A series of scandals alarmed his mother but gratiﬁed the
press by the copy they yielded. The prince with his coterie of rich friends
such as Sir Thomas Lipton, who made a fortune from the new retail
trade in groceries, epitomized the ‘plutocracy’. The evangelicalism and
tractarianism which made such a mark on the aristocracy in postRegency days, and which made Palmerston’s dandyism in the 1850s and
102

1860s seem conspicuously out of place, appeared to give way to
ostentatious consumption and a general moral laxity. Some aristocrats,
such as Lord Salisbury, the Tory prime minister, continued the old
fashion of simple living despite magniﬁcent surroundings, with a
household noted for its religious tone. But Salisbury, the last prime
minister to wear a beard, was becoming an anachronism by his last
decade, the 1890s. Arthur Balfour, his nephew and successor as prime
minister, was seen as a free-thinker. Balfour and Edward VII
characterized the new fashion – the one apparently sceptical, the other
openly sybaritic.
Despite the marked difference in style between Victoria and her son,
the monarchy – the apex of the court and of polite society generally –
guarded its prerogatives, which increasingly she saw as best
safeguarded by a Conservative government. Her long disappearances
from public life after Albert’s death in 1861 were unpopular, and made
possible quite a serious republican movement stimulated by the Paris
Commune, which was headed off with some skill by the Liberal Party
leadership in the early 1870s. It was the absence and idleness of the
monarch that caused widespread adverse comment, not her presence.
In a rapidly changing society with important elements strongly
receptive to the appeal of hierarchy, the monarchy, carefully
presented by the growing mass-communications industry, seemed
something of a ﬁxed point, with its emphasis on family, continuity,
and religion. Walter Bagehot in his classic study, The English
Constitution (1867), pointed out that the English ‘defer to what we
may call the theatrical show of society . . . the climax of the play is the
Queen’. The monarchy helped to legitimize power: it is ‘commonly
hidden like a mystery, and sometimes paraded like a pageant’, as it
was with great success at the jubilees in 1887 and 1897. The obvious
ordinariness of Victoria herself, her well-publicized sufferings (‘the
widow of Windsor’, bravely performing her duties), and the fact that
she was a woman, old and often ill, pointed up the contrast between
103

Pomp and Circumstance

ﬂourished under both. Victoria in her long reign (1837–1901) jealously

human frailty and the majesty of institutions, much increasing respect
for the latter.
The monarchy represented the timeless quality of what was taken to be
a pre-industrial order. In an increasingly urbanized society, it balanced
the industrial revolution: the more urban Britain became, the more
stylized, ritualized, and popular became its monarchy, for the values
which it claimed to personify stood outside the competitive

Nineteenth-Century Britain

egalitarianism of capitalist society.

104

Chapter 17
‘A Great Change in Manners’

Britain (with the exception of Ireland) between the 1850s and the 1890s
was a society of remarkable order and balance, given its extraordinary
underlying tensions of industrial and social change. Though political
rioting did not altogether disappear, it became infrequent enough to
encourage widespread comment. Crime on the mainland, in the form
of both theft and acts of violence, declined absolutely as well as
relatively – an extraordinary development in a rapidly expanding
population, ﬁrmly contradicting the adage that industrialization and
urbanization necessarily lead to higher rates of criminality. The
Criminal Registrar noted in 1901 that, since the 1840s, ‘we have
witnessed a great change in manners: the substitution of words
without blows for blows with or without words; an approximation in
the manners of different classes; a decline in the spirit of lawlessness’.
This largely self-regulating society relied on voluntary organizations –
the Churches, the Friendly Societies, a vast network of charitable
organizations – to cater for spiritual and physical deprivation. In one
important area – education – it was already admitted by the 1860s that
voluntary effort by the Churches could not supply an elementary
education system adequate to the needs of an industrial state, and in
1870 the Liberal government passed an act to set up School Boards,
with a duty to build board schools where there were no Church schools
(though children were not required to attend them until 1880, and had
to pay to do so until 1891).
105

Local initiative, especially in London and some of the northern
manufacturing towns, grafted on to the elementary schools a quite
effective and wide-ranging system of technical education for teenagers
and even adults, but because it depended on the imagination of each
school board, this system was patchy and in no way matched its German
equivalent. Manufacturing towns, notably Manchester and
Birmingham, set up civic universities much less oriented towards a
classical education than Oxford and Cambridge for those entering the
traditional professions. Government responsibility for education was
seen by contemporaries as one of Mill’s exceptions to the rule, not as

Nineteenth-Century Britain

the start of a wider acceptance of responsibility for social organization.

106

Chapter 18
‘Villa Tories’: The
Conservative Resurgence

By increasing the electorate from 20 per cent to 60 per cent of adult
men in the towns, and to 70 per cent in the counties, the Reform Acts of
1867 and 1884 posed problems for politicians. Household suffrage
presented them with a much larger, though by no means universal,
body of voters (far short of a universal suffrage, even for men) and
elections were by secret ballot after 1872, whereas previously each
individual’s vote had been published.
For the Liberal coalition, accustomed never to losing general elections,
the question was, could their amorphous system of informal alliances
continue to be successful? It was a question posed the more starkly
when Gladstone’s ﬁrst government disintegrated in the traditional
Liberal style in 1873–4, and then, untraditionally, lost the election, thus
yielding power to the Tories for the ﬁrst time since 1846.

The Liberals’ Response
The Liberals’ response was twofold. In certain urban areas, and
especially in Birmingham, where Joseph Chamberlain was the dominant
political ﬁgure, a tight ‘caucus’ system of party organization was
introduced. The ‘caucus’ was a group of self-appointed local notables,
often nonconformist business men, and usually strongly critical of the
Liberal Party leadership as being too cautious and too aristocratic. The
107

National Liberal Federation, formed in 1877, attempted to give a degree
of bureaucratic unity to the sundry local caucuses. On the other hand,
the Liberal leadership, still predominantly aristocratic, reacted with
alarm.
Spanning the two groups was the commanding ﬁgure of Gladstone, son
of a Liverpool (originally Scottish) corn merchant, but educated at Eton
and Christ Church, Oxford; himself strongly Anglican but in the later
phases of his career sympathetic to nonconformist aspirations, he was
thus able to appeal to a wide spectrum of Victorian society. Gladstone
had no ‘caucus’ to back him up: he aspired to a national rather than
a local basis of power. He appealed over the heads of the local

Nineteenth-Century Britain

organizations to the body of Liberal opinion at large, and his means
was the political speech and pamphlet.
The new and vast network of national and provincial newspapers, linked
by the telegraph, allowed for the ﬁrst time an instant national debate: a
politician’s speech could be on the breakfast table of every middle-class
household in the land the morning after it was given. Thus in the
general election campaign of 1868, in his campaign against the Disraeli
government’s supine reaction to massacres of Christians by Turks in
Bulgaria in 1876, and in his campaign against the moral and ﬁnancial
delinquency of the imperialistic exploits of the Conservatives in 1879–80
(the ‘Midlothian Campaign’), Gladstone blazed a new trail in an attempt
to create a great popular front of moral outrage. ‘The Platform’ became
the characteristic form of late Victorian politics: Gladstone invented a
new forum of political debate, and his contemporaries, both Liberal and
Tory, were obliged to join in.

Tory Revival
The 1867 Reform Act brought the Tories new opportunities.
Accustomed, almost habituated, to losing, they began to win. In 1867
the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations was
108

founded, and in 1870 a Central Ofﬁce began to improve the coordination of electoral strategy. The target for the Tories was the
boroughs: to obtain political power they had to enlarge their base from
the counties to the expanding towns and suburbs. This they did with
very considerable success in the 1870s and 1880s. Under the leadership
of Disraeli they won the general election of 1874 convincingly; under the
leadership of Salisbury after Disraeli’s death in 1881 they became the
predominant party.
They achieved this by linking an essentially hierarchic, aristocratic, and
Anglican party with the aspirations of the expanding middle and lower
middle classes in the great cities: the Tories became the party of
property and patriotism. Disraeli saw that political success was
becoming as much a question of presentation as of policy. In famous
speeches in Lancashire and at the Crystal Palace in 1872, he portrayed
institutions of the nation, betrayers of Britain’s world and imperial
interests. In a more positive vein, he advocated a policy of social reform,
supposedly of particular appeal to such members of the working classes
as had recently become voters. The themes of these speeches –
especially the patriotic ones – were quickly taken up by other
Conservatives. They were the prototype for most Tory election
addresses for the next century.

Social Reforms
The early years of the Conservative government of 1874–80 were
marked by a burst of social reforms mostly promoted by R. A. Cross, the
home secretary: artisans’ dwellings, public health, Friendly Societies,
river pollution, the sale of food and drugs, merchant shipping, trade
unions, factories, drink licensing, and education were all the subject of
legislation. Many of these reforms were ‘in the pipeline’ and owed a
strong debt to the Peelite–Liberal traditions which had also motivated
the previous Gladstone government. They affected middle-class
109

‘Villa Tories’

the Liberals as unpatriotic, a danger to property, a threat to the

perhaps more than working-class interests, and because the social
measures were permissive rather than compulsory their effect was
more limited than might have been expected (for example, by 1880,
only 10 of 87 Welsh and English towns had decided to implement the
Artisans’ Dwellings Act). Nonetheless, these reforms were important in
Conservative mythology. They showed that the Tories could be a party
which dealt effectively with urban questions, and they offered the basis
for the claim that ‘Tory democracy’ was a reality. Contrasted with
German conservative answers to the problems of urban life, they
appeared integrative, conciliatory, and constructive.
But the real interest of Conservatism was the consolidation of an urban

Nineteenth-Century Britain

middle-class base: working-class support was a bonus. The bogy of
Liberal lack of patriotism was only partially successful, for the Tories’
claim to be the party of competent imperialism was severely dented by
their mishandling of events in South Africa and Afghanistan in the late
1870s, and by the high costs of their military exploits. It was hard
simultaneously to be imperialists and to appeal to the middle-class
virtue of ﬁnancial retrenchment: a self-contradiction which Gladstone’s
Midlothian speeches skilfully exposed.

The Nadir of Liberalism
The Tories lost the 1880 general election, borne down partly by
Gladstone’s oratory, partly by the trade recession of that year. The
succeeding Gladstone government of 1880–5 was the nadir of
Liberalism, the party restless, the Cabinet divided. In imperial affairs,
Tory claims seemed borne out: hesitation and confusion led to a series
of disasters, culminating in the death of Charles Gordon at Khartoum in
1885. Too habituated to the way the ‘ofﬁcial mind’ of the colonial ofﬁce
thought to decline to extend imperial responsibilities, the Liberals
occupied territory while declaring their regrets: electorally, they lost
both ways, alienating anti-imperialists by doing too much, and
imperialists by seeming reluctant.
110

12. Gladstone on the stump, addressing a crowd in Warrington,

expenditure made positive reform difﬁcult. In marked contrast to
1868–74, the government was noted for only one great reform, the
county franchise reform of 1884. The enfranchisement of agricultural
labourers was expected to deliver the county seats into the Liberals’
hands, and Salisbury used the blocking power of the House of Lords to
extract a great prize as a ‘tit-for-tat’: a redistribution bill allowed the
boundaries of borough seats to be drawn much more favourably to the
Tories. Thus the Tories were able to use a Liberal reform to create a
political structure of single-member, middle-class urban and suburban
constituencies, on which the basis of their subsequent political success
rested for over a century.
The effect of this was to make the Liberals increasingly dependent on
the ‘Celtic fringe’, the Irish, Scottish, and Welsh MPs. The concerns and
priorities of these three countries thus moved on to the centre of the
British imperial stage.

In domestic affairs, Gladstone’s determination to control and reduce

Chapter 19
Ireland, Scotland, Wales:
Home Rule Frustrated

That there was an ‘Irish problem’, nobody could deny: what it was,
hardly anybody could agree. Disraeli caught the tone of metropolitan
bewilderment: ‘I want to see a public man come forward and say what
the Irish question is. One says it is a physical question; another, a
spiritual. Now it is the absence of the aristocracy, then the absence of
railroads. It is the Pope one day, potatoes the next.’

Irish Agriculture
Irish agriculture was overwhelmingly the country’s largest industry and
was overwhelmingly owned by Protestants, who mostly, contrary to
popular myth, lived on or near their estates. It ﬂourished in the boom of
the 1850s and 1860s and achieved a modest degree of technical
improvement, but it remained, compared with England, grossly undercapitalized. Ireland could not produce its own capital, and could not
attract much from England. The Irish economy could not sustain its
population: unknown numbers moved to the mainland, where no town
of any size was without its Irish community. Between 1841 and 1925
gross ‘overseas’ emigration included 4.75 million to the USA, 70,000 to
Canada, and more than 370,000 to Australia.

112

Fenians and Parnellites
The legacy of the 1798 rebellion, the failure of Daniel O’Connell’s
attempt in the 1830s and 1840s to repeal the 1800 Act of Union, and the
catastrophe of the Famine of 1845–6 and 1848, produced the Fenian
Irish independence movement of the 1860s, which attempted risings in
the USA, Canada, and Ireland. In 1867 it astonished England by a series
of bomb explosions, notably one at Clerkenwell Prison in London, in
which over 100 innocent persons were killed. The Fenian movement in
no sense represented Irish opinion generally, but the danger that it
might come to do so encouraged Liberal politicians, especially
Gladstone, to concessionary action. Disestablishment of the Anglican
Church in Ireland in 1869, the Land Act of 1870, and an abortive
were intended to show that Westminster could give the mass of the
Irish what they wanted. But these reforms were not enough. Isaac Butt’s
Home Government Association ﬂourished, and the Liberal Party,
hitherto the dominant party in Irish politics, was on the run. The
agricultural depression from the early 1870s to the mid-1890s greatly
worsened the situation.
Charles Stewart Parnell (like Butt, a Protestant) became leader of the
Home Rule Party in 1877, a position he held until his ruin in a divorce
scandal in 1890. Parnell was prepared to exploit every political situation
without reluctance or embarrassment – but even this tougher line was
to some extent outﬂanked by the Land League, which sought personal
ownership of the land for the peasantry. Parnell, somewhat
ambivalently, became its president in 1879. The Land League – a potent
blend of ‘physical-force’ Fenians and ‘moral-force’ Parnellites fused into
a popular front of nationalistic Catholicism – fought a sustained
campaign against evictions in the ‘Land War’ of 1879–82 at the height of
the depression, meeting them with violence and their perpetrators with
‘boycotting’ (named after Captain Charles Boycott, whose nerve
cracked when faced with social and economic ostracism). Violence in

the Irish countryside, and the murder in 1882 of the Irish secretary, Lord
Frederick Cavendish, Gladstone’s nephew by marriage, astonished and
appalled the propertied classes in England, which, as we have seen, had
become accustomed to a very low level of violent crime.

Home Rule
The Gladstone government of 1880 met this crisis on the one hand with
coercion and on the other with concession, in the form of the 1881 Land
Act, which gave much to the peasants, but did not give them
ownership. The Home Rule Party increased its hold on Ireland (helped
by the county franchise reform of 1884) and at the election of December

Nineteenth-Century Britain

1885 won 86 seats, thus holding the balance of power between the
Liberals and Tories at Westminster.
Gladstone cut the Gordian knot by coming out for Home Rule; a private
appeal to Salisbury to treat the question on a bipartisan basis was
rejected. Gladstone’s decision was quite consistent with the main thrust
of Liberal thinking, but its timing recognized political necessity: only
once subsequently, in 1906, were the Liberals to gain power without the
need for the support of Home Rule MPs in the lobbies. Most Liberals
championed devolution and the rights of nations ‘struggling rightly to
be free’, as Gladstone put it; it was hard to deny in 1886 that Ireland had
proved itself to be such a nation. The question was, was its nationality
to be recognized or crushed? Moreover, the moderate Home Rule Bill
produced by Gladstone in 1886 did not grant independence, though it
was the argument of its opponents, ﬁrst, that despite Parnell’s
assurances it would in the long run lead to Irish independence, and,
second, that it gave no safeguard against ‘Rome Rule’ to the Protestant
population, mostly concentrated in Belfast, the industrial capital of the
province of Ulster.
This complex series of events led to a major crisis in British politics. The
Liberal Party, faced with Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill in the summer of
114

1886, split: 93 MPs, most of them Whigs under Lord Hartington but with
some radicals under Joseph Chamberlain, voted with the Tories against
the bill, thus bringing down the Liberal government and introducing 20
years of Conservative (or Unionist, as the anti-Home Rule Coalition was
called) hegemony. With the Liberal-Unionists (the defectors from
Liberalism) went a signiﬁcant proportion of the Liberal press and almost
all those landed aristocrats who traditionally paid most of the party’s
electoral expenses. This loss of inﬂuence and money was probably of
more importance to the Liberals than the actual numbers of defecting
MPs, though in the Lords the Liberals were now a tiny minority.
The split of 1886 weakened the party, but left Gladstone in control of it
and of the National Liberation Federation, a hold he consolidated at its
Home Rule thus shackled Liberalism to Gladstone. Before 1886, Ireland
blocked the way to the passage of second-rank measures, so Home Rule
was necessary as well as right. But after 1886, Home Rule was
impossible, given the existence of the House of Lords. Home Rule thus
both stimulated Liberals to battle for the right, and condemned them to
a generation of frustration.

Scotland and Wales
Naturally enough, events in Ireland affected Scotland and Wales. In
both, disestablishment of the Church also became a political issue, and
both experienced land campaigns. These had little of the violence
characteristic of parts of Ireland, though in the Isle of Skye troops were
used in 1882 to suppress crofter demonstrations. Certain Liberals in
both countries demanded ‘Home Rule All Round’ and this movement,
buoyed up by the cultural renaissance that Wales and Scotland shared
with Ireland in the late nineteenth century, achieved considerable
inﬂuence in the Liberal Party in the late 1880s and 1890s. Unlike Ireland,
however, the Liberal Party was able to contain within itself the quasinationalistic movements in Scotland and Wales, partly because the

dominant industrial sector in Scotland and the growing predominance
in Wales of the South Wales coalﬁeld bound those countries far more
intimately than Ireland to the imperial economy; in southern Scotland
and south Wales, Liberal imperialism trumped nationalism.

Tory Consolidation
With the Liberal Party split, and unable to reunite despite various
attempts in the late 1880s, the Tories consolidated their hold. They were
not active reactionaries. Salisbury made no attempt to reverse the
Liberal achievements of the 1850s–1870s, which at the time he had so
bitterly opposed. Their position and their alliance with the Liberal-

Nineteenth-Century Britain

Unionists depended on preventing things being done, not on doing
them. Thus though some legislation was passed, particularly the
establishment of elected County Councils in 1888, a measure to improve
working-class housing in 1890, and, later, the Education Act of 1902,
which went some way to establishing a system of secondary education,
the Unionist hegemony of 1886–1905 was not a period of legislative
signiﬁcance, nor was it intended to be.
The urban electorate which the Tories essentially relied upon wanted
the continuation of the Liberal state of the 1850s and 1860s, without the
new accretions to Liberalism such as Home Rule. It rejected Gladstonian
Liberalism, not because it had turned its back on the gains of the freetrade years in the mid-century, but because the Gladstonian Liberals
seemed to have progressed too far beyond the objectives of that period.
The anti-Gladstonian coalition thus relied heavily on Home Rule to keep
the coalition together and to keep the Liberals out. It ventured beyond
its anti-Home Rule stance at its electoral peril, as it was to ﬁnd out in the
early years of the twentieth century.
The continuing Liberal commitment to Home Rule helped in this. The
short Liberal minority government of 1892–5 (Gladstone’s last
administration, with the Earl of Rosebery as its prime minister after
116

Gladstone’s retirement in 1894) spent much effort upon the second
Home Rule Bill, which it succeeded in passing through the Commons
only to see it thrown out by the Lords. The Liberals could mount a
disparate majority made up of the English counties, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland, but they could not sustain it or repeat it. The Unionists won
convincingly in 1895 and conﬁrmed their majority in 1900, taking
advantage of temporary successes in the South African war to hold the
‘Khaki election’.

Reluctant Imperialists?

The Unionist case against Home Rule had always had an imperial
dimension: imperial power must not be devolved, the very
circumstances of the passing of the Act of Union in 1800 showing the
strategic importance of Ireland, which Home Rule would again put at
risk. In the last third of the century, imperial issues became much more
of a public preoccupation; we must now look at their effect on Britain’s
position in the world.

Trade and the Flag
The British did not as a whole look for increased direct imperial
authority, and pressure groups for its extension were of little popular or
political signiﬁcance. Indeed, in the old areas of white settlement, they
successfully sought to devolve authority, passing the Dominion of
Canada Act in 1867 and the Commonwealth of Australia Act in 1900. Yet
the last 40 years of the century saw the annexation of vast areas of land
in Africa, the Far East, and the Paciﬁc. In 1851 Britain was the world’s
trader, with an overwhelming dominance of world shipping, which
continued even when Britain’s dominance in manufactured goods was
declining after 1870. British interests were thus to be found wherever
there was trade, even though British imperial authority might not be
formally present. Informal imperialism thus preceded formal annexation:
nothing could be less true than the adage, ‘trade follows the ﬂag’. In
118

almost every case, it was the opposite. As Joseph Conrad’s novels
illustrate, there was no creek, however distant, without its British
representative, organizing the shipping of parafﬁn oil and local goods.
In East and Central Africa, the ﬁrst European presence was often
religious, as evangelical medical missionaries such as David Livingstone
preached the gospel, healed the sick, and exposed the inhumanity of
the inland slave trade. H. N. Stanley’s ‘rescue’ of Livingstone in 1871,
skilfully self-publicized, became one of the great adventure stories of
Victorian times, and greatly increased interest in ‘the dark continent’.
In some areas, British attempts to trade were supported by arms – a
notable example being the opium monopoly of the Indian government
and the general free-trading access which was forced upon the Chinese
treaty of Tien-tsin (1858), the most disreputable of all Britain’s
imperialistic exploits, because it was a considered and consistent policy,
not the accidental result of a local crisis. Governmental involvement of
an oblique sort was sometimes used to develop small beginnings
through the device of the Chartered Company – a trading company with
governmentally guaranteed rights to trade and administer an area;
Nigeria, East Africa, and Rhodesia all came under eventual British rule in
this way, for when a Company went bankrupt (or effectively so – Cecil
Rhodes’s British South Africa Company never paid a dividend before
1920 and was taken over in 1923), the British government had little
option but to assume its administrative responsibilities.

India
In addition to this huge and largely informal network of trade was the
centre-piece of India, ‘the chief jewel in the imperial crown’, now no
longer so proﬁtable, but the assumed focal point of British thinking
about security outside the European context. Following the Indian
mutiny of 1857–8, the old East India Company was wound up, and its

government by the British in a series of ‘opium wars’, culminating in the

Map 4. The expansion of the British Empire, 1815–1914

territories came under direct British administration. In 1876, at the
express wish of the queen, an Act was passed at Westminster which
declared her ‘empress of India’.
To safeguard India, and the route to that subcontinent, various
annexations were made. In the vicinity, Burma and Malaya were
annexed, largely at the urging of the government of India in Calcutta,
which conducted its own programme of imperialism with the
systematic approach characteristic of everything it did, and quite
dissimilar to the haphazard methods of London. On the route, Egypt
and the Sudan came under British control, and imperial expansion in
East and South Africa was at least partly affected by Indian
considerations. This simple statement of course disguises an extremely
complex narrative with respect to each of these annexations. The most
120

Reluctant Imperialists?

controversial annexations were in Egypt and South Africa, and some
attention should be given to these.

The Crimea
The route to India had made security in the eastern Mediterranean,
especially against Russia, a long-standing British preoccupation.
Between 1854 and 1856 the British and French, with some assistance
from Piedmont–Sardinia, had sent substantial ﬂeets and armies to prop
up Turkey. The Crimean War had a complex series of causes, but the
root one was Russian aggrandizement against the sprawling and feeble
Ottoman Empire. The performance of Britain and France, the two most
‘advanced’ European nations, against ‘backward’ Russia was
disappointing and in certain respects inept, although the supply by sea
121

of large armies at a considerable distance created new problems. The
newspaper reporting by telegraph of the hardships of the troops starkly
illustrated the problems and the paradox of warmaking by a liberal
state, and Florence Nightingale made a name for herself as the ‘lady
with the lamp’. The immobility of the campaign, which consisted
largely of a series of sieges, bloodily resolved in the Crimea and in the
area of Kars in Asiatic Turkey, looked forward to the 1914–18 war. Turkey
was successfully defended, and the British thus shored up the Ottoman
Empire, of which Egypt was a part.

Turkey

Nineteenth-Century Britain

The hope was that Turkey would reform and behave like a modern,
liberal state. This hope was not fulﬁlled. By the 1870s, Turkey was again
disintegrating, and under attack from Russia. The Disraeli government
of 1874–80 continued the Crimean policy of defending Turkish
integrity. The Liberal opposition under Gladstone argued that this was
no longer feasible and supported the division of much of ‘Turkey in
Europe’ into separate, Christian states. The ‘Concert of Europe’ present
at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 reached agreement on this, and
Disraeli returned to London bringing ‘peace with honour’ and the
imperial gain of the island of Cyprus, thought to be of strategic
importance for the eastern Mediterranean, but in fact useless as a
naval base.

Egypt
As Turkey disintegrated, so Egypt became increasingly self-reliant,
organizing the building of the Suez Canal, opened in 1869, and of great
importance to Britain’s links with India. The inﬂow of capital to build the
canal destabilized Egypt, which began to disintegrate socially and
politically. In 1875 Disraeli bought the Khedive’s large holding in the
shares of the company which ran the canal. Thus when Egypt reached
the point of bankruptcy, and a military coup was attempted, Britain had
122

not only a general strategic interest in the situation but also a direct
ﬁnancial one. After attempts to ﬁnd alternatives, Gladstone reluctantly
invaded and occupied Egypt on behalf of the canal’s creditors in 1882,
and the British remained until 1954, though the country was never
formally annexed and was thus similar in status to the theoretically
independent princely states in India. Formal annexation of the rebellious
Sudan naturally followed in a series of campaigns in the 1880s and
1890s, the Mahdi, the slayer of the maverick Gordon in 1885, being
ﬁnally and ruthlessly crushed by Field Marshal Kitchener at the battle of
Omdurman in 1898. Turkish decay thus drew Britain into becoming the
major power in the eastern Mediterranean and in north-eastern Africa.

South Africa
presence of the Boers. The Cape was occupied in 1795 to safeguard the
route to India. The security of the hinterland, whither the Boers had
trekked in the 1830s, affected the Cape. Various plans for incorporating
the Boers in a federation were suggested, and confederation was
imposed upon the Boers by the Disraeli government in 1877 at a
moment when the Boers were weakened by the Zulus. Incompetent
generalship (a feature of British military operations in South Africa) led
to the death of 800 British troops at Isandhwana, one of the very few
occasions in colonial wars in which spears triumphed over guns. This
was, of course, only a temporary set-back, and the Zulus were
liquidated at Ulundi (1879). The Boers then wished to regain their
independence. After a short war, when the defeat of a small group of
British soldiers at Majuba Hill in 1881 gave a propaganda coup to the
Boers out of all proportion to its military signiﬁcance, an ill-deﬁned
agreement was reached: the Transvaal and Orange Free State to have
independence, but under British suzerainty.
Increasing exploitation of diamonds and the discovery of gold in the
Transvaal in 1886 transformed the situation. In ﬁnancial terms, Southern

Events in South Africa were not dissimilar, but were complicated by the

Africa became literally Britain’s chief imperial jewel. The inﬂux of capital
directed by men such as Cecil Rhodes destabilized the rural economy
of the Boers, as it had that of Egypt. The Transvaal, like Egypt, went
bankrupt, but the Boers, under Paul Kruger, retained strict political
control. An attempt by Dr Jameson, a crony of Rhodes, to encourage a
rising by the Uitlanders (the British in the Transvaal without political
rights) failed in 1896. Alfred Milner, the new high commissioner,
asserted British rights over the Boer republics and determined to break
Kruger by war. Milner goaded Kruger into attacking Cape Colony in
1899, and what was expected to be a short, limited war began. The
Boers, however, were well stocked with German arms; the British, used
to ﬁghting colonial wars against undisciplined natives without guns,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

proceeded ineptly, and a series of disasters followed before weight of
armaments captured the main Boer cities in 1900. The war seemed over,
and Chamberlain, the colonial secretary, persuaded Salisbury to hold
the ‘Khaki election’, easily won by the Unionists. But the Boers refused
to accept defeat, and harassed the British with guerrilla tactics. The
British replied by burning Boer farms, clearing the veldt, and
systematically herding Boer families into ‘concentration camps’. High
death-rates in the camps led to radical protests in Britain. ‘When is a war
not a war?’ asked Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery’s successor
as Liberal leader, answering himself: ‘When it is carried on by methods
of barbarism in South Africa.’ In 1902, peace was negotiated: Milner had
failed in his aim of smashing the social and political structure of
Afrikanerdom.

124

Chapter 21
The Fin-de-Siècle Reaction:
New Views of the State

The Boer War was immensely expensive, costing far more than all
Britain’s other imperial exploits in the nineteenth century put together.
It failed to smash the Boers, but it did smash the Gladstonian system of
ﬁnance, raising government expenditure to a new plateau from which
it never descended. The war also put into stark and dramatic popular
form a number of concerns which were already preoccupying the
intelligentsia. The war showed the strength and loyalty of the empire,
for the white colonies sent troops to help, but it also showed its
weaknesses. The empire seemed over-extended and under-coordinated. The British navy was no longer pre-eminent. The French navy
was being joined as a threat by the Germans, the Italians, the
Americans, and the Japanese. The policy of ‘splendid isolation’ began to
look dangerous.
Imperial rivalry had meant that in the 1870s–1890s France had usually
seemed Britain’s most likely enemy and Germany the most likely friend.
Germany’s navy plan of 1898, and its bid for ‘a place in the sun’, which
coincided with its encouragement to Kruger during the Boer War, now
made Germany seem a potent threat, the contemporary feeling about
which is well captured in Erskine Childers’s classic spy story The Riddle of
the Sands (1903). Naval security in the Indian Ocean and the Paciﬁc was
gained by the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902. This attempt to limit
imperial responsibility was followed up by agreements (ententes)
125

resolving imperial differences with France in 1904 over North Africa and
with Russia in 1907 over Persia. The Boer War thus led to a ‘new course’
in British foreign policy. For while these ententes were formally about
extra-European areas, their real importance came to lie within Europe;
although they were not alliances, they committed Britain, to some
extent, to the side of the Franco-Russian alliance against Germany and
Austria in the rising tension in Europe. What that extent was, it was not
yet clear.

The Economy
Anxieties about world security raised by the Boer War also popularized

Nineteenth-Century Britain

discussion about Britain’s relative economic position, for it was upon
this that national strength ultimately rested. The overwhelming
superiority of the British economy of the 1850s was much diminished.
The USA, Germany, France, and Russia were now all substantial
industrial powers, with the ﬁrst two superior to the British in certain
sectors of their economies. Britain was now one among several, no
longer the unaccompanied trail-blazer. Yet for the most part British
society and government behaved as if nothing had changed. The liberal
state of the 1850s and 1860s, with its precepts of free trade, minimal
government spending, and an economy autonomous and selfregulating, lingered on, almost as carefully guarded under Conservative
as under Liberal management. The per capita expenditure of central
government in 1851 was £2.00; by 1891 it had only increased to £2.50 (by
1913 it was to be £4.00). In the 1880s and 1890s this situation came
under increasing criticism, much of which the Boer War seemed to
conﬁrm and popularize.
Slow military progress in the Crimean War of the 1850s led to criticism
of the competence of the ruling elite; military ineffectiveness and the
poor quality of recruits in the South African war led to a public cry
among the propertied classes for a reappraisal of the economic, social,
and even political arrangements of the nation as a whole.
126

Social Darwinism
Before considering the various schools of criticism of traditional
Liberalism, a general inﬂuence should be noted: that of ‘social
Darwinism’. We saw earlier that positivists were strong supporters of
laissez-faire. In the 1880s and 1890s the inﬂuence of social Darwinism
began to take a different form. The struggle for ‘the survival of the
ﬁttest’ began to be seen less in terms of individuals in the market-place
and more in terms of competition between nations. This dramatically
reduced the number of units under discussion, and raised the question,
prompted also by the imperialism which was related to this national
competition, of whether individual ‘races’ were not better subjects for
inquiry than a myriad of individuals, and whether ‘advanced races’
genetic organization.
This concept – a marrying of the British science of evolution and the
German concept of the organic state – powerfully affected
contemporary thought: the language of ‘race’ became the common
coin of reformers right across the political spectrum, from Rudyard
Kipling, ostensibly the poet of the right, through J. A. Hobson and
L. T. Hobhouse, the philosophers of the new liberals, to G. B. Shaw,
regarded as the playwright of the left. The popular form of social
Darwinism readily became a facile assumption of racial superiority,
linked to imperialism, as the popular press reported the successes of
the many small-scale colonial military expeditions. Popular reporting
of these emphasized the importance of individual daring, character,
and initiative, ‘deeds that won the empire’, rather than the enormous
technical disparity between a disciplined European army armed with
riﬂes, and from the 1890s the occasional machine-gun, and local forces
relying on massed use of spears or, at best, sporadic musket ﬁre.

127

The Fin-de-Siècle Reaction

could control their destinies by governmental, social, or perhaps even

‘National Efﬁciency’
Criticism of the liberal state in its classic Victorian form came from three
chief political directions: from discontented Conservatives and
Unionists who believed their political leadership was excessively
hidebound by the canons of Peel–Gladstone ﬁscal policy, from Liberals
who believed Liberalism must move on to meet new challenges, and
from socialists who, at least at ﬁrst glance, challenged the whole order
of the state. Elements from each of these came together to demand
‘national efﬁciency’, a slogan intended to suggest a willingness to use
government power to organize and legislate for an ‘Imperial race’ ﬁt to

Nineteenth-Century Britain

meet the challenges of the world.

Critics of the Free-Trade State
The free-trade state had always had its critics. The most inﬂuential of
these in the second half of the nineteenth century was John Ruskin, art
critic and social commentator. Politically impossible to categorize,
Ruskin’s powerful prose in works such as Unto this Last (1862) attacked
the aesthetics of industrial society, but he offered no very systematic
critique. His aesthetic criticisms were taken up by the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, a group of painters, writers, and craft workers who
emphasized, especially through the writings and designs of William
Morris, the values of pre-industrial England, a mythical land of craft
workers, contented peasants, and romance. From such inﬂuences
sprang wide-ranging changes in design and architecture, epitomized by
the ‘English style’ of domestic architecture of Norman Shaw and, at the
turn of the century, Edwin Lutyens, which characterized the best of the
building of the new suburbs. From Morris also sprang a socialist rhetoric
of enduring potency: the image of a rural, self-sufﬁcient, egalitarian
society of sturdy yeomen. Morris did not confront industrialization, he
by-passed it.
The aestheticism of the Pre-Raphaelites, and their general critique of
128

middle-class morality, was given fresh impetus by the aesthetes of the
1880s and 1890s, the most notable of whom was the wit and playwright
Oscar Wilde. He was ruined, like his fellow Irishman Parnell, by the
public exposure of his sexual habits. Wilde’s remarkable essay, ‘The Soul
of Man under Socialism’, exempliﬁed the links between aestheticism
and individualist rather than collectivist socialism.

The Left
From 1884 these leanings towards socialism were supplemented by the
London-based Fabian Society, whose members included Sidney and
Beatrice Webb, Shaw, H. G. Wells, and, later, the young Ramsay
MacDonald, all strong social evolutionists. The Fabians’ criticism of the
inefﬁcient and wasteful: a centrally planned economy and labour
market, administered by an elite of trained professionals, would
eliminate inefﬁciency, the trade cycle, and its by-products such as
unemployment and poverty. It would attain this end gradually through
legislation and not by revolution (hence the name Fabian, after the
Roman general whose tactics the society emulated).
Perhaps the chief contribution of the Fabians was to assist in the
development of a fresh concept of ‘progress’ on the British left, which in
the 1880s was becoming limited in its horizons by the persistent
wrangles over Home Rule. For the Fabians addressed themselves to the
existing intelligentsia: they were not a popular movement. But popular
discontent with the limitations of Gladstonian Liberalism was also
developing; Keir Hardie, a former coalminer from the Ayrshire coalﬁeld,
stood for the view that the increasingly unionized working class must
have its own representatives in the House of Commons (where MPs
were still not paid). Hardie, elected for West Ham in 1892, had helped
form the Scottish Labour Party in 1888 and, in 1893, founded the
Independent Labour Party in Bradford. The ILP saw itself as a socialist
party, but it had difﬁculty in establishing a popularly supported
129

The Fin-de-Siècle Reaction

Liberal economic order was not so much that it was unjust, as that it was

organization. It shared with the Liberals an anti-imperialist rhetoric,
supported ‘Home Rule All Round’, but called also for nationalization.
H. M. Hyndman’s Social Democratic Federation was more vigorous in

Nineteenth-Century Britain

its quasi-Marxist ideology, but gained very little popular foothold.

130

Chapter 22
Old Liberalism, New
Liberalism, Labourism,
and Tariff Reform
All these movements were limited in their impact; the Liberals remained
overwhelmingly the dominant party of the ‘left’ (the use of the word
became common in British political discussion for the ﬁrst time in the
1880s). Nonetheless, the ideas being put forward, and the threat of their
organizational success, concentrated Liberal minds.

Land Reform
Liberals made their own contribution to the intellectual debates of the
last two decades of the century. Always the party of land reform, their
enthusiasm for it was rekindled by works such as the American Henry
George’s Progress and Poverty (1880). Posing the question, ‘what does
produce poverty amid advancing wealth?’, George’s answer was,
crudely stated, the rents of the landed proprietor and the exclusion of
workmen from free access to land, both rural and urban. The solution
was a thoroughgoing and efﬁcient land tax, known as ‘the single tax’.
The land campaign was a major theme of radicalism until the First
World War, and beyond.
‘Why do we sit and quietly behold degradation worse than that from
which we have rescued women and children in mines and factories?’
asked Arnold Toynbee, the liberal Christian historian and radical and,
with T. H. Green, a great radical inﬂuence in the Oxford of the 1870s and
131

early 1880s. Toynbee’s followers (such as Canon Barnett, founder of
Toynbee Hall in East London in 1884) encouraged, ﬁrst, personal (often
religious) commitment on the part of the intelligentsia to on-the-spot
observation of working-class problems, and, second and later, an
acceptance that voluntary effort would not be sufﬁcient by itself to
solve those problems.

New Liberalism
‘Advanced radicals’ came to anticipate much greater government
involvement in the economy, and much more ‘positive liberalism’ to see
that each individual had the means by which he or she could make the

Nineteenth-Century Britain

most of his or her individual abilities. This was bound to cost money,
and Liberals believed this money should be raised by increasing direct
taxation, in particular death duties and a graduated income tax, to
achieve a measure of redistribution at the same time as raising revenue.
An important step in this direction was taken by the 1892–5 minority
Liberal government, which paid for increased social reform and
naval expenditure by imposing for the ﬁrst time an effective death
duty.
‘New Liberalism’, as this movement came to be called, was an attempt
to justify the free-market system by making it work ‘fairly’; it attempted
a rationalization of capitalism, not its replacement. The movement,
whose most effective author was J. A. Hobson, also a strong critic of
‘immoral’ imperialism, hoped to convert the Liberal Party to ‘New
Liberalism’ and thus to allow the continuation of the Liberals as a
broadly based party, capable of continuing to assimilate and integrate
the urban working class. This would avoid the German situation, where
the working class had formed its own class-based Marxist party which
rejected the legitimacy of the German State. This view was reinforced by
political expediency on the Liberals’ part. Following a series of adverse
legal decisions which questioned their legal right to picket and their
freedom from damages culminating in the famous Taff Vale case
132

(1900–1), some trade unions, now in the late 1890s growing fast, joined
with the ILP to form the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. The
Liberals, split three ways by the Boer War, were at their weakest, and
seemed to be able to offer the trade unionists, hitherto Liberal, little
chance of redress. The secretary of the LRC, Ramsay MacDonald,
negotiated an electoral agreement with the Liberals in February 1903,
by which Liberal and Labour constituency parties would not split the
progressive vote to let in a Unionist, but would reach local agreements
by which a number of Labour candidates would have a good chance of

This accommodation between the two parties of the left showed the
considerable area of agreement that existed between them: the Labour
Party (as the LRC became in 1906) was part of the ‘party of progress’, at
least for the time being, sharing many of its reforming aspirations, and
its commitment to free trade.

Tariff Reform
The Unionists (as the coalition of Tories and Liberal-Unionists should be
called after 1895, when Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Hartington, the
Liberal-Unionist leaders, entered Salisbury’s Cabinet) wished to
conserve the British constitution as it then stood. But most of them also
conserved its ﬁscal arrangements and remained free traders. Lord
Salisbury gave no effective support to protection despite his large
majority in both Houses. The imperialist faction within his party,
however, increasingly came to see some form of imperial protection as
essential.
Their reasons for this were threefold. First, they believed that the
growing success of the American and German economies was due
to the protection of young industries, and that in the new era of
technically sophisticated industry – chemicals, electricals, cars – Britain
would lose out unless there was protection, a degree of planning, and

Gazette, 12 November 1903

much more co-operation between industry and education, all things
that only government could supervise. Second, they believed that an
Imperial Customs Union (analogous to the German Zollverein of the
early nineteenth century) could integrate the empire’s economy, Britain
producing manufactured goods, the colonies raw materials. Third, they
saw tariffs, including duties on food, as the only alternative to direct
taxation to pay for the social reforms necessary to make the imperial
race ﬁt for the increasingly harsh competition between nations which
they believed the future would bring.
This programme was embodied in the Tariff Reform campaign launched
by Joseph Chamberlain in 1903 while still colonial secretary, much to the
embarrassment of the prime minister, Arthur Balfour, who had
succeeded his uncle, Lord Salisbury, the previous year. Well ﬁnanced,
sophisticatedly organized and presented, Tariff Reform divided the
Unionist Party (though the young Winston Churchill was one of the few
134

MPs who actually left it). It was renounced by the electorate in a series
of by-elections and then in the general election of 1906, when the
Liberals together with 29 Labour MPs returned with a huge overall
majority. England had turned from Home Rule in the 1880s and 1890s,
but not from free trade. The Peel–Gladstone tradition of open markets
and cheap food still carried great weight: ‘the big loaf and the little loaf’
was the Liberals’ effective catch-phrase.

The End of Victorianism
factors – hostility to Tariff Reform, the dislike of Balfour’s 1902
Education Act by nonconformists (their ranks swollen by a great
religious revival), general criticism of the Unionists’ handling of imperial
affairs – the atmosphere had changed. There was much ‘old Liberalism’
(and ‘old Toryism’) still around, but the critiques of the Victorian liberal
state made from the left, the right, and by Liberals themselves bit deep.
The opening years of the twentieth century (there was much debate as
to whether it began on 1 January 1900 or 1901) brought the widespread
use by the better-off of its characteristic appliances, available in the
1890s but slow to ﬁnd markets because of technical inadequacies –
electric light in the houses, telephones, typewriters, gramophones,
cars – and, soon, wireless and aeroplanes. The ﬁrst building in the world
specially designed as a cinema was opened in Colne, Lancashire, in 1907.
Quite suddenly, the Victorian years and their preoccupations began to
seem worlds away. The deaths of the three most notable public ﬁgures
of those years – Gladstone in 1898, Victoria herself in 1901, Salisbury in
1903 – emphasized the change.

of social inquiries in the 1890s and early 1900s into the working of the
labour market and into social conditions – investigations such as Charles
Booth’s Life and Labour of the People in London (which appeared in four
series of 33 volumes in all, 1889–1903) and Seebohm Rowntree’s Poverty:
A Study of Town Life (1901). Booth and Rowntree for the ﬁrst time
attempted to deﬁne ‘poverty’ as a social phenomenon (as opposed to
the Poor Law’s deﬁnition of pauperism, which was a legal category).
Rowntree found over 27 per cent of the population of York living in what
he called ‘primary or secondary poverty’. Standards of living might have
risen for employed working people since the 1880s, but a signiﬁcant
proportion of the population was shown still to live in ‘poverty’ (a
relative term) and on the brink of economic disaster. This contrasted
markedly with the ﬂamboyant ‘plutocratic’ living, noted earlier, of some
members of the court and aristocracy.
Almost 30 per cent living in poverty was shocking, and it shocked
contemporaries. But it also meant that 70 per cent were living in relative
afﬂuence, a proportion inconceivable in the days of the ‘iron law of
wages’ of the mid-century. In the 1860s, Gladstone as chancellor had
admitted that the economy necessarily functioned with an ‘enormous
mass of paupers’, and Victorians had been aware, in an ill-deﬁned and
helpless way, of the waste and suffering around them. Matthew
136

Arnold’s Culture and Anarchy (1869) described London’s East End as
containing ‘those vast, miserable, unmanageable masses of sunken
people’. Victorian reactions to it had been consequently local and
personal, in the form of personal, charitable endeavour to alleviate the
lot of those actually known to them or of particular categories of the socalled ‘deserving poor’; for example, distressed gentlefolk. Now, at the
turn of the century, systematic investigation not only raised alarm that
an ‘imperial race’ could be so impoverished, but, by providing ﬁgures,
suggested manageability and means of redress: until the scale of the
problem was known, it could not be tackled. ‘While the problem of 1834
was the problem of pauperism, the problem of 1893 is the problem of
poverty’, remarked Alfred Marshall, the leading free-trade economist;
he implied that the problem of poverty had become both deﬁnable and
solvable.

Poverty and the State
The Liberal governments of 1905–14, especially after Herbert Asquith
became prime minister in 1908 on Campbell-Bannerman’s death, made
a considerable attempt to begin to come to terms with these questions.
Free school meals (1907); old age pensions (a scheme drawn up in 1908
by Asquith before becoming prime minister, though seen through the
Commons by David Lloyd George, his successor as chancellor of the
Exchequer); the Development Act (1909) anticipating Keynesian deﬁcit
ﬁnancing; Winston Churchill’s labour exchanges (1909); and Lloyd
George’s National Insurance Act (1911) giving compulsory insurance to
certain workers for beneﬁts in times of sickness and unemployment,

Nineteenth-Century Britain

paid for by the state, the employer, and the employee – these and a host
of smaller measures constituted the ﬁrst legislative milestones of the
modern welfare state. They were based on the rejection of the Victorian
principle that individual probity and diligence would ensure modest
prosperity: the reforms accepted that capitalism was wasteful,
inefﬁcient, and punishing to individuals regardless of personal merit,
and that ‘voluntaryism’ was not enough. But they were nonetheless the
reforms of free traders who believed that marginal adjustments to the
system could phase out the injustices of capitalism and make it ‘fair’.

Taxation and the Lords
These reforms were expensive but based on a wide measure of
consensus; it was the raising of revenue to pay for them which caused
particular controversy, a controversy compounded by the need to raise
large sums to pay for a ﬂeet of Dreadnought battleships to match
German naval expansion. The Tariff Reformers advocated protective
indirect taxes to raise such revenues: the Liberals legislated for
expanded direct taxes. Lloyd George’s budget of 1909 brought a longfestering issue to a head by introducing a ‘super-tax’ on the incomes of
the very rich and an attempt at an effective tax on land. Balfour and the
Unionists used the House of Lords to throw out the budget.
138

This was the culmination of increasing use of the Lords to frustrate
Liberal legislation: the Home Rule Bill of 1893 and a series of measures in
1906–8 had been either mutilated or destroyed. The rejection of the
budget, traditionally the prerogative of the Commons, struck at a
central tenet of British representative government. The Unionists
argued that the conventional exemption of ﬁnancial legislation meant
that Liberals were using it to ‘tack’ on what was really social legislation –
but all taxation was, and always had been, ultimately social in its
consequences. Two general elections in 1910 left the Liberals dependent
on Labour and Irish support, but nonetheless with a clear majority
against the Lords: the Unionist leadership – though not all its followers –
eventually conceded the point and the Parliament Act of 1911 limited the
Lords’ veto to two years.

This great institutional battle had begun with a basic question about
social organization: where would the extra tax burden fall – on the rich
through the super-tax or on the poor through food taxes? Its progress
raised another, about constitutional organization. For the Liberals, as
required by their Irish supporters, now introduced the third Home Rule
Bill, which, together with disestablishment of the Anglican Church in
Wales, became law under the provisions of the Parliament Act in 1914,
though suspended in practice for the duration of the war.
The Unionists reluctantly swallowed the budget, but Home Rule they
would not stomach. With implicit encouragement from their new
leader, Andrew Bonar Law (who replaced Balfour in 1911), they took
literally the slogan coined by Lord Randolph Churchill in 1886: ‘Ulster
will ﬁght and Ulster will be right.’ Guns, many of them German, were
shipped to Northern Ireland. There was doubt about the loyalty of the
army to the State. Three times denied possession of power by the
electorate of the United Kingdom as a whole, the Unionists brought
Ireland to the edge of civil war in 1914 despite substantial Liberal
139

Edwardian Years

Home Rule

concessions on the Ulster question, which might have been introduced
rather earlier. The outbreak of the First World War prevented posterity
from knowing whether the Unionists would have gone over that edge.
Edwardian Britain was thus a turbulent time for politics and politicians.
The resurgence of Liberalism and the Liberals’ willingness to come to
terms with many problems long delayed or frustrated was a painful
business for the Unionists, who continued to regard themselves, in or
out of power, as the natural rulers of the nation.

Women

Nineteenth-Century Britain

But if an old elite’s decline caused the greatest trouble, new, rising
forces were also very active. The movement for women’s suffrage went
back to J. S. Mill’s attempt to amend the 1867 Reform Bill to give women
the vote. Some progress was made, for some women gained the vote
for local elections, and for the synod of the Church of England, and
could stand as candidates for local councils, school boards, and the poor
law board. But the marginal public role given to middle-class women in
the 1870s and 1880s – helping the priest, the doctor, or the MP; being
secretary to the charity whose chair was almost always a man; taking
university examinations but not degrees – was no longer enough.
Exclusion from voting for elections of the imperial Parliament
exempliﬁed what had come to be seen as deprivation; the campaign for
women’s votes was a campaign for a new concept of citizenship.
Millicent Fawcett’s National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies,
uniting in 1897 a number of well-established organizations, was a
broadly based movement of impeccably liberal credentials which made
considerable headway. It was, however, outﬂanked and outshone by the
Pankhursts’ Women’s Social and Political Union (1903). The WSPU
increasingly advocated violence against both property and individual
politicians, as well as inﬂicting, through imprisonment and hunger
strikes, considerable hardship and even occasionally death upon its
140

members. Whether the WSPU helped or hindered the cause is hard to
say: on the one hand, it dramatized it, on the other, its support for
violence alienated many potential supporters among MPs and in
particular Asquith, the prime minister, and made its legislative success
less likely. Despite committed support within the Liberal and Labour
Parties, and from a few Unionists, no legislation had been passed by
1914.

Trade Unionism and Labour
The Edwardian years also saw a very considerable expansion of the trade
union movement, from 2 million members in 1901 to 4.1 million in 1913.
In the years after 1908, price inﬂation and stationary wages encouraged
this burgeoning movement to exert its strength; and there was a series
in 1911, which Lloyd George, as chancellor, defused – also something of a
precedent. Since Labour Party membership could only be held through
being a trade union member, and since most trade unions came to be
afﬁliated to the Labour Party (the afﬁliation in 1909 of the coalminers,
the chief union still hitherto supporting the Liberals, was a particular
triumph), the Labour Party grew considerably in strength. A wide
network of constituency parties was established with a ferment of
ideological discussion, much of it necessarily utopian in character (and
inspired by William Morris), for the means of implementation was as yet
very limited.
The party had a secure base in the Commons, but of a limited size, and
considerably dependent on its pact with the Liberals which brought it
29 seats at the 1906 election. Its limited success at elections was not
surprising, given that in the sort of industrial seat in which it would
expect to succeed, about 60 per cent of adult men were not
enfranchised. As yet, the party in the Commons saw itself largely as a
pressure group for trade union interests, successfully amending the
original Liberal bill so as to prevent the legal incorporation of the unions
141

Edwardian Years

of major strikes in 1910–12, culminating in the ﬁrst general railway strike

through the 1906 Trade Disputes Act, the consequence of the Taff Vale
case. The Labour Party also intervened on social questions and on
foreign policy. This slow progress at Westminster led some trade
unionists (notably some of the Welsh miners) to turn to syndicalism,
that is, ‘direct action’ by trade unions to promote workers’ control,
circumventing MPs, Parliament, and the mechanisms of representative
government.
The Labour Party’s existence and success, closely linked to the
expansion and difﬁculties of trade unionism, reﬂected a social, as much
as an intellectual, difference from the Liberals. The solidarity of the
Labour movement was based on cultural and social afﬁnities, the shared

Nineteenth-Century Britain

experiences of working people in work and leisure, as much as any
articulated perception of themselves as a separate class. Working
people did not feel themselves to be alienated from the propertied
classes, but they did feel themselves to be different. The Liberals
reinforced this by their failure to adopt working men as candidates:
however broad the agreement on policy matters, the middle-class
members of the Liberal Associations – the people who called the tune in
the constituencies – would not adopt as candidates men whom they
would expect to enter their houses by the servants’ door.

142

Chapter 24
‘Your English Summer’s
Done’

The refurbished Liberalism of the Edwardian years thus faced many
difﬁculties. Legislatively, it met these dynamically and imaginatively
with the ﬁrst of the two great reforming governments of the century. It
successfully contained and in large measure resolved the crisis over
ﬁscal policy, welfare policy, socialism, and militarism which had brought
many Continental nations to a political impasse by 1914 (though Ireland
remained potentially an exception to this). It was not domestic divisions
which were to bring Liberal governments in Britain to an end, but
foreign affairs.

Anglo-German Hostility
We noted earlier the ambivalent consequences of the entente policy
pursued by Lord Lansdowne, Balfour’s foreign secretary, and between
1905 and 1914 by Sir Edward Grey for the Liberals. Britain was committed
implicitly and emotionally, but not in terms spelt out, to the French–
Russian side of the European equation. Secret military conversations
after 1905 between the British and the French increased this
commitment. Although the greatest imperial power, Britain could bring
little direct inﬂuence to bear on Continental affairs. R. B. Haldane’s army
reforms developed an Expeditionary Force intended for Europe, but,
though efﬁcient, it was tiny compared to the vast, conscript armies of
143

the Continental powers. Indeed, the Germans simply discounted it, to
their cost.
As the concept of the ‘Concert of Europe’ gave way to overtly
nationalistic self-assertion, the British contribution waned. Though
personally strongly anti-German, Grey continued to avoid formal
alliances, but by 1910 it was clear that Germany would be Britain’s
adversary, if it were to have one. In a series of incidents in North Africa,
the Balkans, and Turkey, and in the continuing escalation of the navy
building programme (despite British attempts, especially in 1911–12, to
negotiate a limitation agreement), Anglo-German hostility became
conﬁrmed. It began to take on a cultural as well as a diplomatic and

Nineteenth-Century Britain

military aspect. The respect mixed with concern characteristic of British
views of German achievements in the 1890s began to change to alarm
and fear.

The Onset of War
When events in the Balkans and Central Europe in June and July 1914
led rapidly to war, as Germany estimated that the moment for her bid
for mastery had come, the British could bring little inﬂuence to bear.
Britain had less to gain from war than any of the other major
European powers except perhaps Russia. Whether the Liberal Cabinet
would have entered the war at all had the Germans not invaded
Belgium is open to doubt. But the Germans ignored both the
traditional British concern for the strategic importance of the Low
Countries, and the implications of guarantee of Belgian independence
which they as well as the British had signed in 1870 to last during the
Franco-Prussian War. The attack on Belgium decided the matter, and
Asquith led his Cabinet into war with only two resignations – John
Morley and John Burns. He did so with a heavy heart: the blithe spirit
which infused the enthusiastic rush to the colours to join the war that
was to be ‘over by Christmas’ was not shared by Britain’s political
leadership.
144

Britain was remarkably unprepared psychologically and, on the whole,
physically for a Continental land war. War on land, even in the Crimea
and South Africa, had been seen as a marginal matter, to be fought by
professionals and a few volunteers. Military values were inﬂuential
amongst the aristocracy and gentry and increasingly in the public
schools, but elsewhere made little impact. Attempts by groups to
militarize society – from the Militia of the 1800s through the Riﬂe
Volunteers of 1859 to Lord Roberts’s National Service League in the
1900s – had conspicuously failed. ‘Trafalgar Day’ was the annual martial
celebration, reﬂecting the essentially naval and defensive cast of the
public mind – the ‘blue water’ policy, as it was called. Except in certain
rural areas, ‘to go for a sodger’, ‘to take the King’s shilling’, had for
ordinary people been an act of desperation in a time of unemployment

The British public liked bands and bright uniforms because they were
entertainments, the exact opposite of harbingers of war. Pomp and
domesticity was the British style. Government contracts for guns and
ships were by the Edwardian years considerable in value and an
important part of the economy of the north east of England, but, in
general, military matters seldom impinged on the thinking of
government and society. Certainly, they had not penetrated the very
fabric of the political, social, and economic order as they had in virtually
every Continental state. The ﬁrst industrial nation had offered the world
a remarkable public experiment in liberal, capitalist democracy whose
success was premised upon free trade and world peace. Tuesday
4 August 1914 brought that experiment to an abrupt halt.
There’s a whisper down the ﬁeld where the year has shot her yield,
And the ricks stand grey to the sun,
Singing:– ‘Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,
And your English summer’s done.’
