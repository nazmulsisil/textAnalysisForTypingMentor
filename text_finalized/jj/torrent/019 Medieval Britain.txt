The Norman Kings

1066 and All That
On Christmas Day 1066 Duke William of Normandy was acclaimed king of
England in Westminster Abbey. It was an electrifying moment. The shouts
of acclamation – in English as well as in French – alarmed the Norman
guards stationed outside the abbey. Believing that inside the church
something had gone horribly wrong, they set fire to the neighbouring
houses. Half a century later, a Norman monk recalled the chaos of that
day. ‘As the fire spread rapidly, the people in the church were thrown into
confusion and crowds of them rushed outside, some to fight the flames,
others to take the chance to go looting. Only the monks, the bishops and
a few clergy remained before the altar. Though they were terrified, they
managed to carry on and complete the consecration of the king who was
trembling violently.’
Despite his victory at Hastings, despite the surrender of London and
Winchester, William’s position was still a precarious one and he had
good reason to tremble. It was to take at least another five years before
he could feel fairly confident that the conquest had been completed.
There were risings against Norman rule in every year from 1067 to 1070:
in Kent, in the south-west, in the Welsh marches, in the Fenland, and in
the north. The Normans had to live like an army of occupation, living,
eating, and sleeping together in operational units. They had to build

1. Aerial photograph of Old Sarum: a graphic illustration of the problems
facing the first post-Conquest generation. The Norman cathedral huddles
close to the castle, itself built to defend a group of men too small to need
the full extent of the prehistoric ramparts

castles – strong points from which a few men could dominate a subject
population. There may well have been no more than 10,000 Normans
living in the midst of a hostile population of one or two million. This is
not to say that every single Englishman actively opposed the Normans.
Unquestionably there were many who co-operated with them; it was
this which made possible the successful Norman take-over of so many
Anglo-Saxon institutions. But there is plenty of evidence to show that
the English resented becoming an oppressed majority in their own
country. The years of insecurity were to have a profound effect on
subsequent history. They meant that England received not just a new
royal family but also a new ruling class, a new culture and language.
Probably no other conquest in European history has had such disastrous
consequences for the defeated.
Almost certainly this had not been William’s original intention. In the
2

early days many Englishmen were able to offer their submission and
retain their lands. Yet by 1086 something had clearly changed.
Domesday Book is a record of a land deeply marked by the scars of
conquest. In 1086 there were only four surviving English lords of any
account. More than 4,000 thegns had lost their lands and been replaced
by a group of less than 200 barons. A few of the new landlords were
Bretons and men from Flanders and Lorraine but most were Normans.
In the case of the Church we can put a date to William’s anti-English
policy. In 1070 he had some English bishops deposed and thereafter
appointed no Englishman to either bishopric or abbey. In military
matters, the harrying of the north during the winter of 1069–70 also
suggests ruthlessness on a new scale at about this time. In Yorkshire
this meant that between 1066 and 1086 land values fell by as much
as two-thirds. But whenever and however it occurred, it is certain
that by 1086 the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was no more and its place
retained its old lands on the Continent; the result was that England
and Normandy, once two separate states, now became a single crossChannel political community, sharing not only a ruling dynasty, but
also a single Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Given the advantages of
water transport, the Channel no more divided England from
Normandy than the Thames divided Middlesex from Surrey. From
now on, until 1204, the histories of England and Normandy were
inextricably interwoven.
Since Normandy was a principality ruled by a duke who owed homage
to the king of France this also meant that from now on ‘English’ politics
became part of French politics. But the French connection went deeper
still. The Normans, being Frenchmen, brought with them to England the
French language and French culture. Moreover, we are not dealing with
a single massive input of ‘Frenchness’ in the generation after 1066
followed by a gradual reassertion of ‘Englishness’. The Norman
Conquest of 1066 was followed by an Angevin conquest of 1153–4;
although this did not involve the settlement of a Loire Valley aristocracy
3

The Norman Kings

had been taken by a new Norman elite. Naturally this new elite

in England, the effect of the arrival of the court of Henry II and Eleanor
of Aquitaine was to reinforce the dominance of French culture.
Whereas in 1066 less than 30 per cent of Winchester property owners
had non-English names, by 1207 the proportion had risen to over 80 per
cent, mostly French names like William, Robert, and Richard. This
receptiveness to Continental influence means that at this time it is the
foreignness of English art that is most striking. In ecclesiastical
architecture, for example, the European terms ‘Romanesque’ and
‘Gothic’ describe the fashionable styles much better than ‘Norman’ and
‘Early English’. Although churches built in England, like manuscripts
illuminated in England, often contain some recognizably English
elements, the designs which the architects and artists were adapting
came from abroad, sometimes from the Mediterranean world (Italy,

Medieval Britain

Sicily, or even Byzantium), usually from France. It was a French architect,
William of Sens, who was called in to rebuild the choir of Canterbury
Cathedral after the fire of 1174. Similarly Henry III’s rebuilding of
Westminster Abbey was heavily influenced by French models. Indeed so
great was the pre-eminence of France in the fields of music, literature,
and architecture, that French became a truly international rather than
just a national language, a language spoken – and written – by anyone
who wanted to consider himself civilized. Thus, in thirteenth-century
England, French became, if anything, even more important than it had
been before. From the twelfth to the fourteenth century a welleducated Englishman was trilingual. English would be his mother
tongue; he would have some knowledge of Latin, and he would speak
fluent French. In this cosmopolitan society French was vital. It was the
practical language of law and estate management as well as the
language of song and verse, of chanson and romance. The Norman
Conquest, in other words, ushered in a period during which England,
like the kingdom of Jerusalem, can fairly be described as a part of France
overseas, Outremer; in political terms, it was a French colony (though
not, of course, one that belonged to the French king) until the early
thirteenth century and a cultural colony thereafter.
4

In western and northern Britain, beyond the borders of conquered
England, lay peoples and kingdoms that retained their native identities
for much longer. As independent peoples living in what were, by and
large, the poorer parts of the island, they remained true to their old
ways of life. Only gradually, during the course of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, did the Welsh and the Scots come to share in this
French-led Europe-wide process of cultural homogenization. The time
lag was to have profound consequences. By the 1120s French-speaking
English intellectuals such as the historian William of Malmesbury were
beginning to describe their Celtic neighbours as barbarians, to look
upon them as lawless and immoral savages, pastoral peoples who lived
in primitive fashion beyond the pale of civilized society but who
occasionally launched horrifyingly violent raids across the borders. A
new condescending stereotype was created, one which was to become
deeply entrenched in English assumptions.

Scottish – society changed in this period creates special problems for
the historian. This is the tremendous proliferation of written records
which occurred during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Many more
documents than ever before were written and many more were
preserved. Whereas from the whole of the Anglo-Saxon period about
2,000 writs and charters survive, from the thirteenth century alone
there are uncounted tens of thousands. Of course the 2,000 AngloSaxon documents were only the tip of the iceberg; many more did not
survive. But this is true also of the thirteenth century. It has, for
example, been estimated that as many as 8 million charters could have
been produced for thirteenth-century smallholders and peasants alone.
Even if this were to be a rather generous estimate, it would still be true
that whole classes of the population, serfs for example, were now
concerned with documents in ways that previously they had not been.
Whereas in the reign of Edward the Confessor only the king is known to
have possessed a seal, in Edward I’s reign even serfs were required by
statute to have them. At the centre of this development, and to some
5

The Norman Kings

One of the ways in which English – and to a lesser extent Welsh and

extent its motor, lay the king’s government. The king possessed
permanently organized writing offices, the chancery, and then the
exchequer too: they were becoming busier and busier. In Henry III’s
reign, we can measure the amount of sealing wax which the chancery
used. In the late 1220s it was getting through 3.63 lb per week; by the
late 1260s the amount had gone up to 31.9 lb per week. Not only was the
government issuing more documents than ever before; it was also
systematically making copies and keeping them. Here the key date is
1199. In that year the chancery clerks began to keep copies, on rolls of
parchment, of most of the letters – and certainly of all the important
ones – sent out under the great seal. The survival of the chancery
enrolments means that from 1199 historians know a great deal more
about the routine of government than ever before.

Medieval Britain

These are developments of fundamental importance. The proliferation
of records involved a shift from habitually memorizing things to writing
them down. It meant that the whole population was now, in a sense,
‘participating in literacy’; even if they could not themselves read they
became accustomed to seeing day-to-day business transacted through
the medium of writing. Clearly this development of a literate mentality
is closely linked with the cultural movement commonly known as the
twelfth-century Renaissance. At first the power-houses of the new
learning all lay abroad in the towns and cathedrals of Italy and France;
but by the late twelfth century there were some schools of higher
learning in England and by the 1220s two universities, first at Oxford and
then at Cambridge, had been established. At Oxford there were schools
where men could learn severely practical subjects such as conveyancing,
administration, and elementary legal procedure. And throughout
England the signs point to an increasing number of schools at all levels.
But are these profound developments associated with revolutionary
changes in other aspects of social organization? Clearly, the production
of all these written records means that society is becoming more
bureaucratic, but does this mean that the relationships between classes
6

2. Indenture with seals. This indenture records an agreement made in the
1220s between a lord and the men of Freiston and Butterwick (Lincs.). The
fifty or so villagers whose seals are attached clearly lived in a society which
was already thoroughly accustomed to using written legal documents

changing? Is the political system changing? Or are both merely being
more elaborately recorded?
These are not questions which it is easy to answer. The cumulative
nature of the evidence tends to deceive. For example, a particular form
of relationship between men may first be clearly documented in the
thirteenth century. But does this mean that the relationship itself
originated in that century? Or that these types of relationship were first
fixed in writing then? Or only that this is the earliest period from which
the relevant documents happen to have survived? A case in point is the
fact that the earliest known examples of a type of document known as
the ‘indenture of retainer’ date from the thirteenth century. The
indenture records the terms on which a man was engaged to serve his
lord; it would normally specify his wages and, if it was a long-service
contract, his retaining fee. On the basis of these documents, historians
have decided that the ‘indentured retainer’ and the ‘contract army’
both came into existence towards the end of the thirteenth century,

The Norman Kings

are being conserved or being altered? Is the economic system

and that they were characteristic of the later Middle Ages, the period of
‘bastard feudalism’. Yet there is clear, though indirect, evidence that
both contract armies and retainers receiving fee and wages were in
existence at least as early as 1100. One further complication. Because
the proliferation of documents occurred earlier and on a much greater
scale in England than in Wales and Scotland, it is very much easier to
write an institutional history of government, law, church, and economy
for England than for the other parts of Britain. But it should also be
borne in mind that throughout this period by far the greater part of the
island’s population lived in England. Before going any further, it will be
useful to give a brief outline of the main events, concentrating on those
that were of greatest concern to the kings of England.

Medieval Britain

William I (1066–87)
After 1071, William’s hold on England was fairly secure. The Welsh and
the Scots gave him little trouble. Scandinavian rulers continued to look
upon England with acquisitive eyes but the ever-present threat of
another Viking invasion never quite materialized. From 1071 to the end
of his reign most of William’s attention was taken up by war and
diplomacy on the Continent. Normandy was his homeland and far more
vulnerable to sudden attack than was his island kingdom. Several of
William’s neighbours were alarmed by his new power and took every
opportunity to diminish it. At their head were King Philip of France, and
Count Fulk le Rechin of Anjou. Their best opportunities were provided
by William’s eldest son Robert (b. 1054). Recognized as the heir to
Normandy as long ago as 1066, he had never been allowed to enjoy
either money or power, and from 1078 onwards he became involved in a
series of intrigues against his father. In quarrels between the king of
France and the duke of Normandy the natural battlefield was the Vexin,
a disputed territory lying on the north bank of the Seine between Rouen
and Paris. The county of Maine, which William had conquered in 1063,
played a similar role in the hostilities between Normandy and Anjou.
Maine was to remain a bone of contention for the next two generations;
8

the Vexin for much longer still (until 1203). Thus already in William’s
reign it is possible to see the political pattern which was to dominate
the next century: the intermingling of family dissension and frontier
dispute. In this context the circumstances of William’s death are
revealing. The garrison of the French fortress of Mantes made a raid into
Normandy. William retaliated and while his troops sacked Mantes (July
1087) he received the injury from which he died. Robert was in rebellion
at the time and chose to remain at the court of King Philip, while his
younger brother William dutifully, and pointedly, was to be found in
attendance at his father’s bedside. On 9 September 1087, William I died.
His body was carried to his great church of St Stephen at Caen. Towards
the end of his life he had grown very fat and when the attendants tried
to force the body into the stone sarcophagus, it burst, filling the church
with a foul smell. It was an unfortunate ending to the career of an
unusually fortunate and competent king.

Whatever William’s last wishes may have been, there was a strong
presumption that the eldest son should have his father’s patrimony,
that is those lands which the father himself had inherited. Thus, despite
his rebellion, Robert succeeded to Normandy. But a man’s acquisition,
the land he himself had obtained whether by purchase, marriage, or
conquest, could more easily be used to provide for other members of
his family. Thus England, the Conqueror’s vast acquisition, was used to
provide for his younger son, William. Naturally, Robert objected to this
and perhaps, if it had not been for his rebellion, he would have
succeeded to England as well.
What is clear is that the customs governing the succession to the throne
were still flexible; they could – should – be bent in order to take account
of political realities, for example the characters of the rival candidates.
Thus those influential men, Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury among
them, who decided to accept William Rufus as king of England, may well
9

The Norman Kings

William II (1087–1100)

have judged that he would make a better ruler than his elder brother. In
view of Robert’s record both before and after 1087 this would have
been a reasonable judgement, yet within a few months of his accession
Rufus found himself opposed by a powerful coalition of great barons,
the magnates. According to the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic
Vitalls, the rebels’ objective was to reunite England and Normandy, not
for the sake of some principle of constitutional law but in order to ease
their own political problems. Their dilemma was summed up in the
words which Orderic placed in the mouth of the greatest of them, Odo
of Bayeux. ‘How can we give proper service to two distant and mutually
hostile lords? If we serve Duke Robert well we shall offend his brother
William and he will deprive us of our revenues and honours in England.
On the other hand if we obey King William, Duke Robert will deprive us
of our patrimonies in Normandy.’ This was an argument which

Medieval Britain

appealed to powerful vested interests and could very easily have
unseated Rufus. If there were to be just one ruler of the joint AngloNorman realm then the elder brother’s claim was difficult to deny.
Fortunately for Rufus, his brother’s case went almost by default: Robert
stayed in Normandy, leaving his supporters in the lurch. Nonetheless
the 1088 revolt, despite its swift collapse, does reveal just how
precarious was the position of a king of England who was not also duke
of Normandy.
Taking the 48 years (1087–1135) of the reigns of William II and Henry I as
a whole, it can be seen that in England the rebellions (1088, 1095, 1101,
1102) cluster in the two periods (some 15 years in all) when the king was
not duke, that is 1087–96 and 1100–6. Obviously, it was not in the king’s
interest that England and Normandy should be under separate rulers.
But neither was it in the interest of the aristocracy. As Odo of Bayeux’s
speech makes plain, they had too much at risk to welcome instability.
Whenever the cross-Channel kingdom did break up into its constituent
parts, this ushered in a period of conflict which was only settled when
one ruler ousted the other. Thus the primary concern of a king of
England was to win and hold Normandy.
10

In 1089 Rufus laid claim to the duchy. With English silver he was able to
buy support and he campaigned there with some success. But his hold
on England still remained insecure; he faced a conspiracy in 1095. Next
year the tension was resolved, at any rate temporarily, in a totally
unforeseeable manner. The astonishing success of Pope Urban II’s
preaching tour created a climate of opinion in which thousands decided
to join an expedition aimed at recovering Jerusalem from the Muslims.
For Robert Curthose this offered an honourable and exciting way out of
his increasingly difficult domestic political position. In order to equip
himself and his retinue for the long march, he pawned Normandy to
William for 10,000 marks.
The new duke’s next task was to recover Maine and the Vexin, lost
during Robert’s slack rule. By 1099, this had been successfully
accomplished. Rufus had restored his father’s kingdom to its former
he intervened more effectively than even his father had done.
One early twelfth-century author, Geoffrey Gaimar, looked upon
William as a model ruler. But Gaimar wrote in French. Unfortunately for

The Norman Kings

frontiers; indeed in Scotland, by installing Edgar on the throne in 1097,

William’s reputation, it was history written by churchmen and in Latin
which was to carry the greater weight. Serious-minded ecclesiastics,

ls

accustomed to the conventional piety and sober discretion of his
father’s court, were appalled by Rufus’s, by its ostentatious

extravagance, by its gaiety, and by the new fashions – long hair for

example – which seemed to them to be both effeminate and licentious.
Rufus never married. According to the We

C

le f

e , ‘he

used concubines and because of that died without an heir’. He may have
been sceptical of the claims of religion; undoubtedly he treated the
Church as a rich corporation which needed soaking. He was rarely in a

hurry to appoint bishops and abbots, for during vacancies he could help
himself to the Church’s revenues. In carrying out these profitable
policies Rufus relied on the ingenious aid of a quick-witted and worldly
clerk, Ranulf Flambard, whom he eventually made bishop of Durham.
11

Above all Rufus’s reputation has suffered because in 1093, when he
thought he was dying, he appointed a saintly scholar Anselm of Bec as
archbishop of Canterbury (after having kept the see vacant for four
years). What made this appointment so disastrous from William’s point
of view was the fact that it occurred at a time when a European
movement for Church reform – the Gregorian reform – had created a
controversial atmosphere in which holy men were only too likely to
become political radicals. In 1095 William called a council at
Rockingham to deal with the matters in dispute between him and
Anselm. To the consternation of all, Archbishop Anselm appealed to
Rome, arguing that as archbishop of Canterbury he could not be judged
in a secular court. The rise of the Papacy in the second half of the
eleventh century, with its claim to the first loyalty of prelates, had
brought a new and disturbing element on to the political stage. If

Medieval Britain

churchmen were to believe that their obligations to God, as defined by
the vicar of St Peter, were to override their duty to the king, then the
customary structure of the world would have been turned upside down.
Anselm’s case in favour of an autonomous spiritual hierarchy was a wellreasoned one; on his own premises he had the better of the argument.
But Rufus had a good case too; not only that, he had power – pitted
against the material resources available to a masterful king, a scholarly

Ans

o

archbishop of Canterbury was in a very weak position indeed. William
continued to harass the archbishop, and never showed any sympathy

for his attempts to reform the Church. Eventually Anselm could bear it
no longer. In 1097 he sailed from Dover, leaving the estates of

Canterbury to be taken into the king’s hand. In the short run the king

had gained from the quarrel. In 1100 he enjoyed the revenues of three
bishoprics and 12 abbeys. Nor was there as yet any sign that the

arguments had undermined men’s belief in the awesome powers of an
anointed king. Even Eadmer, the Canterbury monk who wrote a Life f
elm, remarked of Rufus that ‘the wind and the sea seemed to obey

him’. Indeed, Eadmer went on, ‘in war and in the acquisition of territory
he enjoyed such success that you would think the whole world smiling
12

upon him’. Whether, in reality, William II’s position in 1100 was quite so
strong is another matter; it suited moralistic chroniclers to portray him
as a self-confident, boastful king who was struck down just when he
seemed to be at the very pinnacle of success. During the summer of
1100 everyone must have known that the peaceful interlude of Duke
Robert’s absence was about to end. The crusader was on his way home,
accompanied by a rich wife and basking in the prestige due to a man
who had fought his way into the Holy City. When Curthose reclaimed
his inheritance, who could tell what would happen or what line the
Anglo-Norman magnates would take? As it happened, on 2 August 1100
a hunting accident in the New Forest brought the life of this forceful and
much-maligned king to an abrupt end. Also, as it happened, William’s
younger brother was in the New Forest on the day the king died.

Henry I (1100–35)
Winchester and took possession of the treasury. Then he went straight
on to Westminster where he was crowned on 5 August. This speed of
action has prompted speculation that Henry knew that his brother was
going to die, that he had ‘arranged the accident’. But no contemporary
makes the charge and if Henry had planned so cold-blooded a crime his
timing is likely to have been different. The impending war between
Rufus and Curthose could be expected to end with the defeat and
perhaps the elimination of one of them. In other words a delayed
assassination would have opened up to the assassin the prospect of
obtaining both England and Normandy. As it was, Rufus’s death in
August 1100 meant that Henry had to act with phenomenal speed
merely to seize control of just one of the two parts of the Anglo-Norman
realm. A man capable of waiting for so long before he struck would
surely have waited a year or two longer.
A few weeks later, Robert arrived back in Normandy. Henry had to
prepare to meet the inevitable invasion. His policy was to buy support
13

The Norman Kings

As soon as he knew Rufus was dead, Henry moved fast. He rode to

by granting favours and wide-ranging concessions. This was a policy
proclaimed on the day of his coronation, when he issued a charter of
liberties denouncing his brother’s oppressive practices and promising
good government. On the other hand the urgent need to organize his
defences meant that Henry could not afford to cause too much
confusion. This was a time for gestures and manifestos, but it was not
the moment to overturn a whole regime. The reality of the situation
was that his elder brother had left him a ready-made court and
administration and Henry had little choice but to take them over.
When Duke Robert landed at Portsmouth in July 1101, many of the
greatest barons in England, led by Robert of Bellme and his brothers,
flocked to his side. But Rufus’s court circle, Robert of Meulan at their
head, remained loyal to Henry; so also did the English Church. Both

Medieval Britain

sides drew back and negotiated. Henry was to keep England and pay his
brother a pension of £2,000 a year.
Having survived the crisis of 1101, Henry set about ensuring that it would
not recur. The essential first step was the overthrow of the house of
Montgomery (Bellême). In 1102 he captured Robert of Bellême’s chief
strongholds in the Welsh marches and then banished him. Two years
later he confiscated the lands of William of Mortain. But Earls Robert
and William, like others in their position, possessed in their Norman
properties a base from which to organize the recovery of their English
lands. By perpetuating the separation of England and Normandy the
treaty of 1101 had ensured the continuance of political instability. So in a
rerun of the history of the previous reign we find a king of England, first
on the defensive, then going over to the attack. At the battle of
Tinchebray (1106) the issue was decided. Duke Robert himself was
captured and spent the last 28 years of his life as his brother’s prisoner.
Although in the first years of his reign Henry was preoccupied with
Norman affairs, he was not as free to concentrate on them as he would
have liked. Traditional royal rights over the Church were threatened by
14

the new ideas associated with the Gregorian reform movement. The
reformers did not only wish to purify the moral and spiritual life of the
clergy; in order to do this, they believed that it was also necessary to
free the Church from secular control. The most hated symbol of this
control was lay investiture, a ceremony in which a new abbot or bishop
received the ring and staff of office from the hands of the secular prince
who had appointed him. Although the first papal decree against lay
investiture had been issued as long ago as 1059 and more prohibitions
had been published since, no one in England seems to have been aware
of their existence until Anselm returned in the autumn of 1100. While in
exile he had learned of the papal attitude to lay investiture. Thus
although he himself had been invested by Rufus in 1093, he now refused
either to do homage to Henry or to consecrate those prelates whom
Henry had invested. This placed the king in a difficult position. Bishops
and abbots were great landowners and key figures in central and local
loyalty. On the other hand, unlike Rufus, he was unwilling to provoke a
quarrel, so for years he found it more convenient to postpone the
problem rather than try to solve it. Not until 1107 was the matter
settled.
Henry renounced lay investiture, but prelates were to continue to do
homage for their fiefs. In practice, the king’s wishes continued to be the
decisive factor in the making of bishops. To some extent, it can be said
that Henry gave up the form but preserved the reality of control. When
Anselm died in 1109 he kept the see of Canterbury vacant for five years.
Yet he had lost something and he knew it. In the fierce war of
propaganda which accompanied the ‘Investiture Contest’ the
Gregorians had insisted that the king was a layman, nothing more, and
as such he was inferior to all priests, for priests were concerned with the
soul and the king only with the body. The Church could no longer
tolerate the old idea that anointed kings were sacred deputies of God. In
giving up lay investiture Henry was acknowledging the secular nature of
his office. It was an important moment in the history of kingship.

administration; he needed their assistance and had to be sure of their

Map 1. The Anglo-Norman realm 1066–1154

Once Normandy had been conquered and a compromise solution found
to the investiture dispute, Henry’s main concern was to hold on to what
he had. Although he promoted some ‘new men’, he knew that political
stability depended on his cultivation of good relations with the
aristocracy. In Orderic’s words, ‘he treated the magnates with honour
and generosity, adding to their wealth and estates, and by placating
them in this way, he won their loyalty.’ A direct threat to Henry’s
position came from the claim of Curthose’s young son, William Clito
(b. 1102) that he, not Henry, was the rightful duke of Normandy. This
rival claim, coupled with Normandy’s long land frontier, meant that the
duchy remained the most vulnerable part of his empire. After 1106
Henry spent more than half the rest of his reign there in opposition to
the traditional enemies of the Norman dukes, notably Louis VI of France
(king 1108–37), and Fulk V of Anjou (count 1109–28). He organized a
protective ring of alliances – no less than eight of his illegitimate
Scotland in the north to Rotrou count of Perche in the south. This
diplomatic pattern lends some slight credibility to William of
Malmesbury’s assertion that for Henry sex was a matter not of pleasure
but of policy. The end result of all this activity was that Henry kept
Normandy and for this reason, since it turned out to be a struggle which
only maintained the status quo, historians have not been inclined to
take it very seriously. But for Henry it was a very serious business
indeed, a war for survival which at least once, in 1118–19, he came
perilously close to losing.
The preoccupation with the defence of Normandy was a serious matter
in England too, and not just for the great landowners who held estates
on the Continent. Castles, garrisons, diplomacy, and war all cost a great
deal of money. The connection is spelt out in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle’s
entry for 1118. ‘King Henry spent the whole of this year in Normandy on
account of the war with the king of France, count of Anjou and count of
Flanders . . . England paid dearly for this in numerous taxes from which
there was no relief all year.’ The king’s long absences and his urgent
17

The Norman Kings

daughters were married to neighbouring princes, from Alexander of

need for money were the motors behind the increasing elaboration and
sophistication of the machinery of government. While the king was
away, England was administered by a vice-regal committee. Twice a year
this committee met ‘at the exchequer’, that is, it met to audit the
accounts of the sheriffs over the famous chequered cloth. Most of the
routine administrative work, in particular the collection of revenue, was
supervised by Roger of Salisbury, a man who, in contrast to the
flamboyant Flambard, seems to have been the archetypal bureaucrat,
competent and discreet.
The death of William, his only legitimate son, in 1120 in the wreck of the
White Ship brought Henry’s whole carefully contrived edifice tumbling
down. From then on, the succession problem dominated the politics of
the reign. Less than three months after William’s death, Henry married

Medieval Britain

a new wife but the heir so desperately hoped for was never born. So
although Henry is said to have acknowledged more than twenty
bastards, he was survived by only one legitimate child, his daughter
Matilda. When her husband, Emperor Henry V of Germany, died in 1125,
Henry recalled her to his court and made the barons swear to accept her
as heir to the Anglo-Norman realm. Then in 1127 Henry received a fresh
shock. William Clito was recognized as count of Flanders. If he were able
to employ the wealth of Flanders in pursuit of his claim to Normandy,
then the outlook for his uncle was black indeed. At this critical juncture
Henry approached Fulk V of Anjou with a proposal for a marriage
alliance between Matilda and Fulk’s son and heir, Geoffrey Plantagenet.
In June 1128 Matilda, somewhat against her will, was married to the
14-year-old youth. Unquestionably, Count Fulk had scored a diplomatic
triumph: the first vital step in the Angevin take-over of the AngloNorman realm.
By 1135 Henry I was quarrelling openly and violently with Geoffrey and
Matilda. This had the effect of driving those magnates who were loyal to
Henry into opposition to the Angevins. When the old king died, these
magnates would inevitably find it difficult to come to terms with his
18

designated heirs. In this sense it was Henry himself who provoked the
succession dispute which followed his death. Even at the end of his life
he still wanted his daughter and son-in-law to succeed, but he had been
unable to bring himself to take the measures which would have enabled
them to do so. Henry I had been an outstandingly able and successful
king, the master politician of his age, but even he failed to cope with the
tensions of the succession question. It was for this reason that Henry of
Huntingdon portrayed Henry as a king in a permanent state of anxiety.
‘Each of his triumphs only made him worry lest he lose what he had
gained; therefore though he seemed to be the most fortunate of kings,
he was in truth the most miserable.’

Stephen (1135–54)
When the news came that Henry I lay dying, the old king’s chosen heirs
nephew, Stephen of Blois, was in his county of Boulogne. From there, it
was but a day-trip to the south-east of England. This accident of
geography gave Stephen a head start. Having first secured the support
of the Londoners, he then rode to Winchester, where his brother, Henry
of Blois, was bishop. With Henry’s help he obtained both the treasury at
Winchester, and Roger of Salisbury’s acceptance of his claim to be king.
Then all that remained was to persuade the archbishop of Canterbury to
anoint him. This was done by arguing that the oath to Matilda – which
they had all sworn – was void because it had been exacted by force, and
by spreading a fictitious story about the old king’s deathbed change of
mind. On 22 December 1135, Stephen was crowned and anointed king at
Westminster.
The political structure of the Anglo-Norman realm meant that once
Stephen had been recognized as king in England, he was in a very strong
position in Normandy as well. From then on, the Norman barons could
give their allegiance to someone else only at the risk of losing their
English estates. Above all, those with most to lose felt that they had to

were in their own dominions, either in Anjou or in Maine. But his

support Stephen. So, right from the start of their campaign to win their
inheritance, Geoffrey and Matilda found themselves opposed by the
most powerful magnates of the Anglo-Norman state.
In the west the news of Henry’s death precipitated a great revolt against
those colonizers who had been turning Wales into what one
contemporary called ‘a second England’, but in England itself the first
two and a half years of Stephen’s reign passed peacefully enough:
indeed they were rather more trouble-free than the opening years of
both his predecessors’ reigns had been. The first serious blow came in
the summer of 1138 when Robert of Gloucester decided to join his halfsister’s cause. Robert’s defection not only meant that Stephen lost
control of some important strong points in Normandy, it was also a
signal that the Angevins were on the point of carrying the struggle to

Medieval Britain

England. As Stephen waited for the blow to fall he began to lose his grip
on the situation, above all in the north where King David I of Scotland
took over Northumbria.
He offended his brother Henry of Blois by not making him archbishop of
Canterbury; he arrested three influential ‘civil service’ bishops,
including Roger of Salisbury, and thus enabled Henry of Blois to claim
that ecclesiastical liberties had been infringed. In the autumn of 1139,
when the Empress – as Matilda was commonly known – landed at
Arundel and seemed to be in Stephen’s grasp, he allowed her to go free
to join Robert of Gloucester at Bristol. From now on there were two rival
courts in England. Had he imprisoned her, the cause of her husband and
sons would have gained yet more support. The fact that Matilda was a
woman had given Stephen his opportunity, but it also, in a chivalrous
age, presented him with insoluble problems.
In February 1141 Stephen rashly accepted battle at Lincoln, and fought
on bravely when he might have escaped. As a result, he was captured
and put in prison in Bristol. Henry of Blois, now acting as papal legate,
openly went over to the Empress’s side and in the summer she was able
20

to enter London. But she spurned the peace terms worked out by the
legate and offended the Londoners by her tactless behaviour. When
Stephen’s queen, Matilda of Boulogne, advanced towards the city, the
Londoners took up arms and drove the Empress out. Thus, the planned
coronation at Westminster never took place. Matilda never became
queen of England. A few months later Robert of Gloucester was
captured and since he was the mainstay of her party, Matilda had to
agree to an exchange of prisoners: Stephen for Robert. The Empress
had thrown away a won position; England remained a divided
country.
In Normandy, events had taken a very different course. Geoffrey of
Anjou stayed behind to maintain the pressure on the duchy and to look
after his own interests in Anjou. A series of campaigns from 1141 to 1144
ended with the surrender of Rouen and Geoffrey’s formal investiture as
conquest of Normandy led to him turning his back on England.
Here the civil war settled down into a kind of routine. Neither side could
make much headway at a time when the art of war revolved around
castles, and the defenders generally held the advantage. In October 1147
Robert of Gloucester died. Disheartened, the Empress left England early
in 1148, never to return.
In 1150 Geoffrey of Anjou associated his son Henry with him in the rule
of the duchy. Next year this arrangement was legitimized when Louis VII
(king of France 1137–80), in return for concessions in the Vexin, decided
to recognize Henry as duke. At this point, it must have looked as though
the old link between England and Normandy had at last been broken.
Yet neither side would give up its claims and though there seemed to be
a stalemate in England, on the Continent the situation turned out to be
remarkably fluid. Geoffrey of Anjou died, still under 40, leaving his
eldest son in control of both Normandy and Anjou. In March 1152 Louis
VII divorced his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eight weeks later she married
21

The Norman Kings

duke. But the count of Anjou’s single-minded concentration on the

Henry, who in consequence could now add control of the vast duchy of
Aquitaine to his other Continental possessions.
Henry’s marriage was a great coup – yet it also gave fresh hope to
Stephen. Louis VII organized a grand coalition of all Henry’s rivals. As a
result, the summer of 1152 saw Henry fighting on four fronts at once – in
Aquitaine, in Normandy, against rebels in Anjou, and against Stephen in
England. One well-informed Norman chronicler tells us that the betting
was that Henry would not survive. At this juncture, his decision to sail to
England and carry the fight to Stephen impressed contemporaries by its
sheer audacity. Even so there was little Henry could do to break the
stalemate in England and his whole position was still precariously overextended when the death of Stephen’s heir, Eustace, in August 1153
transformed everything. Stephen’s second son, William, had never

Medieval Britain

expected to be king and so the way was opened for a negotiated
settlement.
The barons on both sides had long been anxious for peace. Their landed
estates made them too vulnerable to the ravages of war for them to be
in favour of protracted hostilities. At times they had ignored the wishes
of the chief protagonists and made local truces of their own. So there
was a general sense of relief when Stephen and Henry bowed to the
wishes of their advisers.
By the treaty of Westminster (December 1153) it was agreed that
Stephen should hold the kingdom for life and that he should adopt
Henry as his heir. William was to inherit all Stephen’s baronial lands.
This, in essence, was a repeat of the peace terms proposed by Henry
of Blois in 1141. Matilda’s inability to be magnanimous in victory had
cost the country another 12 years of civil war. Now at last Stephen
could rule unchallenged, but he was a tired man and did not live
long to enjoy it. On 25 October 1154 he died and was buried by the
side of his wife and elder son in the monastery they had founded
at Faversham.
22

Stephen had been a competent army commander and a brave knight –
but perhaps too gallant for his own good. He was a more attractive
character than any of the Norman kings – but he lacked their
masterfulness. Without it he was unable to dominate either his court or
his kingdom. Moreover he spent very little time in Normandy; only one
visit, in 1137, during his entire reign. This stands in marked contrast to
the itineraries of his predecessors and, in view of the ‘cross-Channel
structure’ of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy, was certainly a mistake. In
this sense the ruler from the house of Blois can be said to have failed
because he was too ‘English’ a king to realize that England was only a
part of a greater whole.

The Norman Kings

23

Chapter 2
The Plantagenet Kings

Henry II (1154–89)
Henry took over without difficulty; it was the first undisputed
succession to the English throne for over a hundred years. As lord of an
empire stretching from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees he was
potentially the most powerful ruler in Europe, richer even than the
emperor and completely overshadowing the king of France, the nominal
suzerain of his Continental possessions. Although England provided him
with great wealth as well as a royal title, the heart of the empire lay
elsewhere, in Anjou, the land of his fathers.
In England his first task was to make good the losses suffered during
Stephen’s reign. By 1158 this had been achieved. The most dramatic
example came in 1157 when he used diplomatic pressure to force the
young king of Scotland, Malcolm IV, to restore Cumberland,
Westmorland, and Northumbria to the English Crown. In Wales,
however, Henry found in Owain of Gwynedd and Rhys of Deheubarth
two well-established princes whom it was impossible to browbeat. In
1157 and 1165, force of arms proved equally unavailing in the face of a
combination of Welsh guerrilla tactics and torrential summer rain. After
1165 Henry’s attitude to the Welsh princes was much more
accommodating. As early as 1155 he had toyed with the idea of
conquering Ireland. Not until 1169–70, however, did the move into
24

Ireland take place, first by some lords from the Welsh march and then
(in 1171–2) by Henry himself. As the long delay makes plain, in the king’s
eyes there were matters much more urgent than the Irish question.
Out of the 34 years of his reign, Henry II spent 21 on the Continent.
Socially and culturally England was a bit of a backwater compared with
the French parts of the Angevin dominion. The prosperous communities
which lived in the valleys of the Seine, Loire, and Garonne river systems
were centres of learning, art, architecture, poetry, and music. Aquitaine
and Anjou produced two of the essential commodities of medieval
commerce: wine and salt. These could be exchanged for English cloth
and this trade must have brought great profit to the prince, who ruled
over both producers and consumers. As duke of Normandy, duke of
Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, Henry had inherited the claims of his
predecessors to lordship over neighbouring territories. These claims
Geoffrey, as count; an expedition against Toulouse in 1159 which
resulted in the capture of Cahors and the Quercy; the recovery of the
Norman Vexin in 1160; and finally, as a result of repeated invasions
after 1166, the occupation of Brittany and the installation of his son
Geoffrey as duke.
Yet ironically it is not for his successes that Henry is best remembered,
but for his dubious part in the murder of Thomas Becket. In June 1162
Becket was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury. In the eyes of
respectable churchmen Becket, who had been chancellor since 1155, did
not deserve the highest ecclesiastical post in the land. He set out to
prove, to an astonished world, that he was the best of all possible
archbishops. Right from the start, he went out of his way to oppose the
king who, chiefly out of friendship, had promoted him. Inevitably it was
not long before Henry began to react like a man betrayed. In the midtwelfth century Church–State relations bristled with problems which
could be, and normally were, shelved by men of goodwill but which
could provide a field-day for men who were determined to quarrel.
25

The Plantagenet Kings

led to intervention in Nantes (1156) where he installed his brother,

Map 2. The Continental dominions of Henry II

Henry chose the question of ‘criminous clerks’ as the issue on which
to settle accounts with his archbishop. Like many laymen, Henry
resented the way in which clerks who committed felonies could
escape capital punishment by claiming trial in an ecclesiastical court.
At a council held at Westminster in October 1163 Henry demanded
that criminous clerks should be unfrocked by the Church and handed
over to the lay courts for punishment. In opposing this, Becket
carried his episcopal colleagues with him but when Pope Alexander III
asked him to adopt a more conciliatory line, Henry summoned a
council to Clarendon (January 1164). He presented the bishops with a
clear statement of the king’s customary rights over the Church – the
Constitutions of Clarendon – and required from them a promise to
observe these customs in good faith. Taken by surprise, Becket
argued for two days and then gave in. But no sooner had the rest of
the bishops followed his example than Becket repented of his
Becket. He summoned him before the royal court to answer
trumped-up charges. The archbishop was found guilty and sentenced
to the forfeiture of his estates. In a hopeless position Becket fled
across the Channel and appealed to the pope. By taking a stand on
principle and then wavering, Becket had reduced the English Church
to confusion.

weakness. Thoroughly exasperated, Henry now decided to destroy

With Becket in exile Henry concentrated on more important matters for
the next five years: Brittany was conquered and the English judicial
system overhauled. Then in 1169 the question of the coronation of the
heir to the throne, Prince Henry, led to the interminable negotiations
between king, pope, and archbishop being treated as a matter of
urgency. In 1170 Becket returned to England determined to punish those
who had taken part in the young king’s coronation. His enemies lost no
time in telling Henry of the archbishop’s ostentatious behaviour. ‘Will
no one rid me of this turbulent priest?’ Henry’s heated words were
taken all too literally by four of his knights. Anxious to win the king’s
favour, they rushed off to Canterbury; and there, on 29 December 1170,
Becket was murdered in his own cathedral. The deed shocked
Christendom and secured Becket’s canonization in record time. In
popular memory the archbishop came to symbolize resistance to the

Medieval Britain

oppressive authority of the State, but in reality everyone was better off
with him out of the way. Once the storm of protest had died down it
became apparent that the king’s hold on his vast empire had in no way
been shaken by the Becket controversy. In the early 1170s Henry stood at
the height of his power.
By this date Henry II had already decided that after his death his
dominions should be partitioned between his three eldest sons. Henry
was to have his father’s inheritance, namely Anjou, Normandy, and
England; Richard was to have his mother’s inheritance, Aquitaine;
Geoffrey was to have the acquisition, Brittany. For the moment there
was nothing for John but later, in 1185, he was granted his father’s other
major acquisition, Ireland. By then Henry II’s partition plans had already
run into difficulties. The trouble was that they aroused expectations
which, while he retained all real power in his own hands, he could not
satisfy. Thus from 1173 onwards Henry was plagued by rebellious sons.
The rebels, moreover, could always count on a warm welcome at the
court of the king of France. After 1180 this was a serious matter for in
that year the mild-mannered Louis VII was succeeded by his son Philip II
Augustus, an unscrupulous politician determined to destroy the
28

Angevin Empire. The deaths of two of his sons, the young King Henry in
1183 and Geoffrey in 1186, ought to have simplified Henry’s problems,
but this was offset by the old king’s obvious preference for John, a
preference which alarmed Richard. An alliance between Richard and
Philip brought Henry to his knees and, defeated, the old king died at
Chinon on 6 July 1189.
Only in the last weeks of his life had the task of ruling his immense
territories been too much for Henry. He rode ceaselessly from one
corner of his empire to another, almost giving an impression of being
everywhere at once – an impression that helped to keep men loyal.
Although the central government offices, chamber, chancery, and
military household travelled around with him, the sheer size of the
empire inevitably stimulated the further development of localized
administrations which could deal with routine matters of justice and
became increasingly complex and bureaucratic. This development,
taken together with Henry’s interest in rational reform, has led to him
being regarded as the founder of the English common law, and as a
great and creative king, but in his own eyes these were matters of
secondary importance. To him what really mattered was family politics
and he died believing that he had failed. But for over 30 years he had
succeeded.

Richard I (1189–99)
Richard’s alliance with Philip Augustus meant that his position as heir
to all his father’s rights and dominions was unchallengeable. John
remained lord of Ireland; in time, Brittany would belong to Geoffrey’s
posthumous son Arthur, now two years old. The rest was at Richard’s
disposal.
But Richard had no wish to stay long in England. He had been made
duke of Aquitaine in 1172 and since then had spent most of his life on the
29

The Plantagenet Kings

finance in his absence. Thus in England, as elsewhere, government

Continent. Even after he became king of England he was well aware that
he ruled much more than England. In consequence he, like his father,
had wider interests and greater responsibilities. One aspect of this was
the assistance he gave to the kingdom of Jerusalem, a kingdom ruled by
a daughter of the junior branch of the house of Anjou now married to
one of his Aquitanian vassals. In November 1187, as soon as he heard the
news of Saladin’s overwhelming victory at Hattin, Richard took the
cross. Delayed by his involvement in the family quarrels at the end of his
father’s reign, he was now determined to leave for the East as soon as
he had raised enough money and arranged for the secure government
of all his dominions during a prolonged absence.
In July 1190 he and Philip Augustus set out on the Third Crusade. Not
until March 1194 did Richard again set foot on English soil. In the

Medieval Britain

meantime he had taken both a fleet and an army to the other end of the
Mediterranean. Although unable to recapture Jerusalem, he achieved an
astonishing amount against a great opponent, Saladin. On crusade
Richard tackled and solved far greater logistical problems than ever
confronted other warrior-kings of England, William I, Edward III, or
Henry V. The treaty of Jaffa which he negotiated in 1192 enabled the
crusader states to survive for another century. Unique among the kings
of England, Richard I played an active leading role in the great events of
world history.
During his absence on crusade there had been some disturbances in
England in 1191 but his contingency plans restored stable government.
King Philip, after his own return to France, tried to take advantage of
Richard’s continued absence, but without success. If Richard had
returned from crusade as he expected in January 1193 he would have
found his empire intact.
The damage was done while he was held captive in Germany. He stayed
in prison for more than a year (December 1192–February 1194) and – for
all anyone knew in 1193 – might have had to stay there much longer.

medical treatise given by a doctor, Master Herbert, to Durham cathedral
priory.)

Even in these inauspicious circumstances Richard’s agents in England
were able to contain his younger brother’s treacherous revolt. The real
losses were suffered on the Continent, in particular in Normandy where
Philip overran the Vexin and came close to capturing Rouen itself.
Richard was released in February 1194 after payment of 100,000 marks,
the first two-thirds of the king’s ransom. After a brief visit to England
(March–May 1194) he returned to the Continent and devoted the next
five years to the hard grind of recovering the territory lost so rapidly
while he was in prison. By the end of 1198 Richard’s skilful diplomacy,
fine generalship, and his greater resources meant that he had
succeeded in recapturing almost everything that had been lost. Then, in
April 1199, Richard died as the result of a wound suffered at the siege of
Chalus-Chabrol (near Limoges) where he was engaged in suppressing a

Medieval Britain

rebellion led by the count of Angoulême and the viscount of Limoges. In
the Angevin–Capetian struggle this was to be the decisive turningpoint.
One of the marks of Richard’s greatness had been his ability to choose
ministers, above all, Hubert Walter in England. As justiciar, archbishop
of Canterbury, and papal legate Hubert Walter stood for harmonious
co-operation between king and Church. In England, as in the other
provinces of the Angevin Empire, Richard’s long absences meant the
continuing development, under Walter’s supervision, of an effective
machinery of central government. From the point of view of Richard’s
subjects, this meant increasingly heavy taxation, but there is no
evidence to suggest that the financial burdens of war had brought the
Angevin Empire to the point of economic collapse.

John (1199–1216)
Richard left no legitimate children, and when he died the different parts
of the Angevin Empire chose different successors. The barons of
England and Normandy opted for John; Anjou, Maine, and Touraine
32

preferred Arthur of Brittany, now 12 years old; Aquitaine continued to be
held – on John’s behalf – by his mother, Eleanor (d. 1204). By May 1200
John had ousted Arthur and had established himself as lord of all the
Angevin dominions, though at a heavy price – he abandoned his allies
and he ceded the Vexin and Evreux to King Philip (treaty of Le Goulet,
January 1200). Later that year his first marriage was annulled and he
married Isabella of Angoulême. There were great strategic advantages
to be gained from marrying the heiress to Angoulême and had John
given her fiancé, Hugh of Lusignan, adequate compensation, all might
yet have been well. As it was, this marriage set in motion a train of
events which led to Hugh appealing to the court of France and, in 1202,
to Philip’s declaration that all John’s Continental dominions – the lands
which he held as fiefs of the king of France – were forfeit. By his tactless
treatment of the leading barons of Anjou and Poitou John threw away all
the advantages he won when he captured Arthur at Mirebeau (July
nephew’s murder (April 1203) further undermined an already shaky
reputation. In an atmosphere of suspicion and fear John found it
impossible to organize an effective defence. In December 1203 he threw
in the towel and withdrew to England. Philip overran Normandy, Anjou,
Maine, Touraine, and all of Poitou except for La Rochelle. These
humiliating military reverses earned for John a new nickname.
‘Lackland’ now became ‘Soft-sword’.
Until December 1203 John, like his father and brother, spent most of his
reign in his Continental possessions. After that date he became, by force
of circumstances, an English king. Not since Stephen’s reign had the
country seen so much of its ruler, but there was little pleasure or profit
to be got from a king who constantly suspected that men were plotting
against him. The weight of John’s presence was even felt in the north
where men were not accustomed to visits from kings of England. The
extent of their resentment can be measured by the number of
northerners who opposed John in 1215–16. Undoubtedly he faced
genuine problems. He was duty-bound to try to recover his lost

the St Albans chronicler, Matthew Paris, probably the best-known English
artist of the thirteenth century. King Philip of France is unhorsed. If he had

inheritance, and the conquests of 1203–4 meant that the French king
was now a much more formidable opponent. Moreover, an unusually
high rate of inflation in the early years of John’s reign had tended to
erode the real value of royal revenues. As a result, John levied frequent
and unprecedentedly heavy taxes and tightened up the laws governing
the forest (a profitable but highly unpopular source of income).
John also quarrelled with the Church. A disputed election to the see of
Canterbury in 1205 led to a clash with Innocent III. In 1208 Innocent laid
an interdict on England and Wales; all church services were suspended
and remained so for six years. In 1209 John himself was excommunicated. Neither John nor lay society in general seem to have been very
worried by this state of affairs; indeed since John’s response to the
interdict was to confiscate the estates of the Church it even helped to
ease his financial problem. But in 1212 a baronial plot and Philip’s plans
to cross the Channel served to remind John that an excommunicated
king was particularly vulnerable to rebellion and invasion. So he decided
to make peace with the Church in order to have a free hand to deal with
his more dangerous enemies. By agreeing to hold England as a fief of

failure, as a statement of law it was always taken seriously. After John’s
death it was amended and reissued in 1216, 1217, and 1225. The reissue
of 1217 was accompanied by the publication of a second, smaller
charter (bottom) dealing with forest law, and so became known as the
large charter, Magna Carta

the Papacy in May 1213 he completely won over Innocent and assured
himself of the pope’s support in the coming struggles. It did him little
good.
All now turned on the outcome of John’s attempt to recover his lost
lands. In 1214 he led an expedition to Poitou but the defeat of his allies at
the battle of Bouvines (July 1214) entailed both the failure of his
Continental strategy and the onset of rebellion in England. But rebels
had genuine problems too. Leadership was normally provided by a
discontented member of the royal family. After the elimination of
Arthur, John faced no such rivals. His own sons were too young. The
only possible candidate was Louis, son of Philip Augustus, but a
Capetian prince was hardly an attractive anti-king. So the rebels devised
a new kind of focus for revolt: a programme of reform. In June 1215, after

Medieval Britain

they had captured London, the rebels forced John to accept the terms
laid out in a document later to be known as Magna Carta. In essence it
was a hostile commentary on some of the more objectionable features
of the last 60 years of Angevin rule. As such it was clearly unacceptable
to John, who regarded the agreement made at Runnymede merely as a
means of buying time. Attempts to implement Magna Carta only led to
further quarrels. In the end the rebels had to invite Louis to take the
throne. In May 1216 he entered London. When John died, in October
1216, shortly after losing part of his baggage train in quicksands in the
Wash, the country was torn in two by a civil war which was going badly
for the Angevins.
John possessed qualities which have endeared him to some modern
historians. He took a close interest in the details of governmental and
legal business, but in his own day this counted for little. It is a mistake
to see him as a busier king than his predecessors. The survival of
chancery records from 1199 onwards permits historians to look, for the
first time, into the daily routine of the king’s government at work. As a
result they have sometimes given the impression that John was
unusually competent. In fact he was a very poor king, incompetent
36

where it really mattered, in the management of his more powerful
subjects.

Henry III (1216–72)
The minority council which governed in the name of John’s nine-yearold son, Henry, was soon vouchsafed that success in war, both on land
(the battle of Lincoln, May 1217) and at sea (battle of Dover, August 1217),
which had been denied his father. Under the impact of these defeats,
support for Louis dwindled rapidly. In September 1217 he accepted the
treaty of Lambeth and withdrew.
It was not until 1232 that Henry began to rule in his own right. Minorities
tended to be periods of unstable government; but, on the whole, the
men, above all Hubert de Burgh, who kept Henry in political tutelage
struggles for power took place in the council chamber; appeals to arms
were rare and very brief. As part of a series of conciliatory moves,
Magna Carta was amended and reissued. But while the lords of the
council concentrated on their own rivalries and on events in England
and Wales, they were understandably less concerned about the king’s
overseas inheritance. None of them had estates in Poitou and Gascony.
In 1224, during one such domestic quarrel, their old Capetian enemy,
now King Louis VIII, walked into Poitou, captured La Rochelle, and
threatened Gascony. An expedition in 1225 consolidated the position in
Gascony but made no serious attempt to recover Poitou. Subsequent
expeditions, in 1230 and 1242, were on a more ambitious scale but
ended ingloriously. After 1224, only Gascony remained of the lands
which Henry III’s ancestors had once held in France. The effect of this
was to reverse the territorial balance of the twelfth century. Once
England had been one of the provinces in the Angevin orbit; now it
became the indisputable centre of the Plantagenet dominions.
Eventually, by the treaty of Paris (1259), Henry gave up his claims to
Normandy, Anjou, and Poitou, and did homage to Louis IX for Gascony.

his counsellors? Ironically, the man who had been most adamant in
insisting that in the last resort it was the barons, acting in the name of
‘the community of the realm’, who should decide, was himself born a
foreigner, Simon de Montfort. By this time, Simon had long been a
powerful member of ‘the community’: earl of Leicester since 1231,
husband of the king’s sister since 1238. In 1264 Earl Simon won the
battle of Lewes, but next year was himself defeated, killed, and
dismembered at the battle of Evesham. In the last years of Henry III’s
reign the full restoration of royal authority was combined with the
recognition, in the statute of Marlborough (1267), that the ‘customs of
the realm’ including both Charters of Liberties and even some of the
Provisions of Westminster, should be upheld. Feeling uncomfortable in
this atmosphere of moderation, the victor of Evesham, Edward, the heir
to the throne, went off on crusade, leaving his father free to concentrate
on rebuilding Westminster Abbey.

In 1272 Edward I was in Sicily, on his way back from crusade, when he
heard the news that his father had died and that he had been
proclaimed king. He returned home at a leisurely pace. In Paris,
choosing his words carefully, he did homage to Philip III for his lands in
France: ‘I do you homage for all the lands which I ought to hold of you.’
He then turned south to Gascony where he stayed in 1273–4. He visited
Gascony again in 1286–9. He was the last king of England to hold court
at Bordeaux and when he left, in July 1289, it marked the end of an era.
Yet the history of English rule in Gascony is by no means a
straightforward story of decline. In 1279, for example, the French at last
handed over the Agenais, as they were bound to do under the terms of
the treaty of Paris. The Agenais was an important wine-growing area
and its cession further strengthened the rapidly developing commercial
links between Bordeaux and London. The Bordeaux wine customs,
farmed for only £300 a year in the 1240s, were worth over £6,000 sixty
years later. In return the Gascons imported English cloth, leather, and

corn. A mutual interest in an expanding trade riveted the two
communities together.
In October 1274, soon after his return to England, Edward launched an
inquiry into the activities of both royal and baronial officials. Like similar
earlier investigations it uncovered an enormous number of grievances,
and in trying to remedy some of these, the king’s advisers, headed by
his chancellor, Robert Burnell, were led on to issue new laws on a wide
range of subjects. But even in the most prolific period of legislation
(1275–90) there was no attempt to codify English law in the manner of a
Justinian and the statutes were quite as much concerned with the rights
of the king as with the liberties of the subject.
From 1276 to 1284 Edward’s main preoccupation was with Wales.

Medieval Britain

Initially his plan was to cut Llywelyn ap Gruffydd down to size and then
hand the Welsh prince’s lands to his brothers Dafydd and Gruffydd. But
after the victorious campaign of 1277 he imposed a peace treaty which
the Welsh found humiliating and failed to give Dafydd the rewards he
had expected. In 1282 the Welsh rebelled. In the war of 1282–3 Llywelyn
was killed and Dafydd captured. He was then put on trial and executed
as a traitor, the first man since 1076 to forfeit his life for rebellion. Unlike
the campaign of 1277, the war of 1282–3 had been intended as a war of
conquest; given Edward’s enormous preponderance of resources, it was
not too difficult a task.
Whereas the conquest of Wales can be seen as the culmination of
centuries of warfare, relations between the kingdoms of England and
Scotland were exceptionally good for most of the thirteenth century.
But in 1286 Alexander III was killed by a fall from his horse and his only
granddaughter, Margaret, the ‘Maid of Norway’, was recognized as heir
to the throne. Edward I proposed that she should marry his own son and
heir, Edward. The Scottish magnates agreed to this proposal (treaty of
Birgham, July 1290) but at the same time insisted that Scotland should
retain its own laws and customs.
40

Sadly, the six-year-old Margaret died in Orkney (September 1290).
Edward seized the opportunity to assert his overlordship and his right to
adjudicate between the contenders for the throne. After complicated
legal arguments he decided in favour of John Balliol; on St Andrew’s Day
1292 the new king was enthroned at Scone. Up to this point Edward was
justified in claiming that his actions had helped to maintain peace and
order in Scotland; but from now on his domineering treatment of the
Scots was to provoke a long and disastrous war.

the

he

Eleventh-century Wales was a collection of small kingdoms in a
mountainous country. These were kingdoms without stable borders.
They expanded and contracted in accordance with law (the custom of
sharing the inheritance between sons) and politics (the ambitions and
military fortunes of individual rulers). Although English kings
traditionally claimed an overall supremacy here, they had done little to
transform that ill-defined overlordship into lasting military and
administrative control. At first it looked as though the impetus of the
Norman Conquest of England would carry the newcomers right through
Wales. The Norman earls of Hereford, Shrewsbury, and Chester were, in
effect, licensed to take whatever they could. But after a period of rapid
advance in 1067–75, they found their progress impeded by the nature of
the terrain. As a result, their colonizing efforts were long confined to the
lowlands and river valleys, particularly in the south. Able Welsh princes
took advantage of instability in England after 1135 and at the time of
Magna Carta to recover the initiative and resume control of lands they
had earlier lost. Not until the reign of Edward I was the Norman
Conquest of Wales complete. Thus throughout this period Wales was a
land of war, a land of castles. Welsh princes and Anglo-Norman marcher
lords made war and peace and both therefore enjoyed what later
constitutional lawyers would call ‘sovereign’ powers.

allowed, some we have corrected, others we have added’. What this
meant in effect was that English common law had been introduced into
Wales.
There were revolts in 1287 and 1294–5 but the castles proved their
worth. Flint, Rhuddlan, Aberystwyth, Builth, Conway, Caernarfon,
Criccieth, Harlech, and Beaumaris – resounding names, and
resoundingly expensive to build and maintain. This was the high
premium Edward paid to insure his conquests against the fire of
rebellion.
The contrast between, on the one hand, the piecemeal conquest of the
south and east and, on the other, the sudden defeat which
overwhelmed the north and west left an enduring mark on the political

Medieval Britain

geography of Wales. The Edwardian conquests were largely retained in
Crown hands; the rest remained divided into the numerous large
lordships collectively known as the march of Wales. As for Prince
Llywelyn, killed in an English trap at Irfon Bridge in 1282, his fate was to
become a cult figure for some twentieth-century Welsh nationalists.

Scotland
In contrast to fragmented Wales, in the eleventh century much of
Scotland, in particular the south and east – the wealthiest part – was
ruled by one king, the king of the Scots. Whereas the Papacy accepted
that Welsh dioceses should come under the authority of Canterbury, it
supported the independence of the Scottish Church. Ever since
Athelstan’s reign, the king of the Scots had occasionally recognized
English overlordship, but that was as far as the connection went – or was
likely to go. On the one hand the king of the Scots was too powerful to
have much to fear from the kind of ‘private enterprise’ invasions which
marked the advance of Anglo-Norman barons into Wales and even
Ireland. On the other, his land was too poor and he was generally too
distant a figure to be of much interest to the kings of England. Besides,
44

although it might not be too difficult to launch a successful
expedition against the Scots, the dual problem of conquering and
controlling so remote a country seemed – and probably was –
insoluble to kings whose own bases lay in the Thames Valley and
further south.
Nor were the Scots obsessed by the problem of the English. Apart from
a temporary success when King David (1124–53) took advantage of the
civil war of Stephen’s reign to acquire Northumbria (held from 1139 to
1157), the border with England effectively remained where it had been
established in the eleventh century. Much more significant was the
kingdom’s extension to include the far north and much of the western
this expansionist policy came when the king of Norway ceded the
Western Isles (treaty of Perth, 1266). Scottish advance here was
materially assisted by the stability and continuity of leadership provided
by three successive kings: William I (1165–1214), Alexander II (1214–49),
and Alexander III (1249–86).
Territorial expansion in the Highlands was matched by internal
development in the Lowlands. Here, burghs, abbeys, and cathedrals
were founded; castles were built and royal sheriffdoms formed in order
to reduce the kingdom to manageable administrative units; royal
moneyers began to mint silver pennies (enjoying parity with English
sterling) and import duties were collected. The marriages made by its
rulers show that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries Scotland was
increasingly becoming part of a ‘European’ political scene. What was
most remarkable about all these developments was that they involved
very little war. So long as no English king conceived the unrealistic
ambition of conquering Scotland, there was no reason for that to
change.

seaboard (Caithness, Ross, Moray, Argyll, Galloway). The culmination of

English Government and the King’s Household
The most important component of government was the king himself.
His character counted for more than any other single factor – as is
obvious from the contrast between Edward I’s reign and the reigns of
both his father and son. But naturally the king could not govern alone.
Wherever he went he was followed by a great crowd: courtiers, officials,
servants, traders, petitioners, and hangers-on of every description.
At the centre of the crowd that followed him was the king’s household.
In part this was an elaborate domestic service: cooks, butlers, larderers,
grooms, tent-keepers, carters, packhorse drivers, and the bearer of the
king’s bed. There were also the men who looked after his hunt, the
keepers of the hounds, the horn-blowers, the archers. Then there were

Medieval Britain

the men whose work was political and administrative as well as
domestic. Some of them had fairly well-defined functions. The
chancellor was responsible for the king’s seal and the chancery clerks.
Treasurer and chamberlains looked after the king’s money and
valuables. Constables and marshals were in charge of military
organization. But the household, like the king, was omnicompetent and
any great household officer, the steward for example, was likely to find
himself entrusted with essential political and military tasks.
Some of these officials were clerks. Until the 1340s the chancellor and
the treasurer always were. But many of them were laymen: the
chamberlains, the stewards, the constables, the marshals – as also, at a
local level, were the sheriffs. Medieval kings of England did not depend
exclusively, or even primarily, upon clerks for the administrative skills
necessary to rule a country. Nor did they rely on a group of royal officials
whose interests were pitted against the interests of the great
landholders, the magnates. On the contrary, the king’s household
normally included some of the most powerful barons. Servants in the
king’s household, they were also lords of great estates and masters in
their own houses. Through their influence the authority of the Crown
46

was carried into the localities. This informal power system was often
reinforced by the appointment of members of the household to local
offices. Under Rufus, Hamo ‘the steward’ was sheriff of Kent; Urse
d’Abetôt was constable of the household and sheriff of Worcester.
Throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries household knights
continued to be employed as sheriffs.
Here, in the king’s household, lay the mainspring of government. This is
as true of 1279, the year of Edward I’s Household Ordinance, as it is of
1136, the approximate date of the earliest surviving description of the
king’s household, the Constitutio domus regis. Moreover there is no
reason to believe that the household of the Constitutio was significantly

Similarly the king’s household was the hub of military organization. It
has long been accepted that the armies of Edward I’s reign were
essentially ‘the household in arms’. The household cavalry constituted a
professional task force capable of responding quickly if trouble blew up
unexpectedly. In the event of a major campaign, it could be rapidly
expanded. Household knights were often made responsible for
mobilizing and commanding large infantry contingents. The household
men, the familiares, were paid annual fees and then daily wages
according to the number of days they served. This, it used to be
thought, was a far cry from the Norman period when armies were
basically ‘feudal hosts’, made up of the quotas of knights which tenantsin-chief mustered when summoned to perform their military service to
the Crown. But close study of the much more fragmentary evidence for
the period around 1100 has demonstrated that not only is it difficult to
find the ‘feudal host’ in action, but also that all the essential features of
the Edwardian system were already in existence – the retaining fees, the
daily wages, the framework for planned expansion, the use of
household troops both as garrisons for key castles and as the main field
armies (composed of knights and mounted archers), the employment
of household knights as commanders of supplementary forces. There is
47

different from William I’s household, or indeed, from Cnut’s household.

no reason to believe that the tasks which Cnut’s housecarls were called
upon to perform were fundamentally different.
For practical purposes there was an upper limit on the size of the royal
household in peacetime; transport and catering problems were alone
sufficient to see to that. To some extent, forward planning of the royal
itinerary helped; when they knew in advance where the household was
going to be then merchants could arrange to be there with their wares.
But the presence of the king imposed a near-intolerable burden on any
district through which he passed. The demands made by the household
had a dramatic effect on local foodstocks and prices; it created a
situation wide open to abuse. This is how Eadmer, a monk of
Canterbury, described the household of William Rufus, a king of whom
he disapproved. ‘Those who attended his court made a practice of

Medieval Britain

plundering and destroying everything; they laid waste all the territory
through which they passed. Consequently when it became known that
the king was coming everyone fled to the woods.’ In Edward I’s reign
there is still the same combination of planning and plunder. An official
letter announcing that he intended to spend Easter at Nottingham
asked that local people should be comforted by being assured that the
king would go as fast as he had come.
Thus it was both for political reasons – in order to make his presence
felt – and for economic reasons – to make his presence no longer felt –
that the king travelled constantly. The sheer size of their dominions
meant that in this respect the Angevins had to work harder than their
predecessors, though John’s political failures did at least have the effect
of easing his travel problems. After 1203 the royal itinerary became
increasingly confined to England and, in Edward I’s case, to North Wales
as well. After 1289 no king visited Gascony. At the same time the roads
leading in and out of London became gradually more important. By
1300 the king’s itinerary was no longer dominated, as John’s had still
been, by the restless move from palace to hunting lodge in ‘central
Wessex’, the old heartland of the West Saxon kings.

pleased (subject to certain conventions). In these circumstances the
king controlled his ward’s marriage. If there were no direct heirs, then
after provision had been made for the widow – whose re-marriage was
also subject to crown control – the king could grant the land out again
to whomever be pleased. This degree of control over the inheritances
and marriages of the wealthiest people in the kingdom meant that the
king’s powers of patronage were immense. He not only had offices at
his disposal, he also had heirs, heiresses, and widows. Thus, for
example, when Richard I gave William Marshal the heiress to the
earldom of Pembroke, he, in effect, made William a millionaire
overnight. No political leader in the Western world of today has
anything remotely approaching the power of patronage in the hands of
a medieval king. It is not surprising that the king’s court was the focal
point of the whole political system, a turbulent, lively, tense, factious

place in which men – and a few women – pushed and jostled each other
in desperate attempts to catch the king’s eye. Not surprisingly it was a
twelfth-century literary convention to describe a courtier’s life as sheer
hell – but standing at the mouth of hell there were hundreds only too
keen to enter. In these circumstances patronage was one of the
strongest cards in the king’s hand. It mattered how he played it, and a
king who played it badly would soon find himself in trouble.
The essential features of this patronage system were already in
existence during the reign of William Rufus. This much is clear from the
terms of the Coronation Charter issued by Henry I in 1100. It is also clear
that the system was still in existence during the reign of Edward I.
Magna Carta had clarified it and, to some extent, even modified it. After
1215, for example, baronial reliefs were fixed at a rate of £100.
Nonetheless, the laws governing inheritance, wardship, and marriage
could still be manipulated to suit a king’s personal predilections,
whether it was to provide for his own family, as with Edward I, or to
enrich favourites, as with Edward II. What is less clear is whether the
system was already there in 1066. Most historians would probably say
that it was not. But it is surely significant that Cnut and, probably,
50

Æthelred the Unready were already making promises broadly similar to
those contained in the charter of 1100.
Patronage was lucrative. Men offered money in order to obtain what the
king had to offer: offices (from the chancellorship down), succession to
estates, custody of land, wardship, and marriage – or even nothing
more concrete than the king’s goodwill. All of these were to be had at a
price, and the price was negotiable. Here was an area in which a king
could hope to raise more money by consistently driving harder
bargains. In these circumstances any document which told the king how
rich his tenants were would naturally be immensely valuable. Domesday
Book is just such a record – and it showed that half the value of the
men heavily when they were in political trouble or by offering them
what they wanted, though at a price, the king had found a practical
method of soaking the rich. Of course the information had to be kept up
to date and throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the Crown
found ways of ensuring that it was. For example, one of the surviving
documents produced by Henry II’s administration is the delightfully
named ‘Roll of Ladies, boys and girls’. Thus to a hostile observer like
Gerald of Wales the king appeared to be ‘a robber permanently on the
prowl, always probing, always looking for the weak spot where there is
something for him to steal’. Gerald was talking of the position under the
Angevins but it may be that Lucy, widowed countess of Chester, offering
Henry I 500 marks for the privilege of remaining single for five years,
would have concurred. The fact that most of the influential people in
the realm were semi-permanently in their debt gave kings a powerful
political lever – and one which they regularly employed. In 1295, for
example, Edward I used the threat of debt collection to force a group of
reluctant magnates to go to Gascony.
The earliest surviving detailed account of royal revenues, the pipe roll of
1129–30, shows just how lucrative patronage could be. In this financial
year Henry I is recorded as having collected about £3,600 from offers of

this kind. This is about 15 per cent of his recorded revenue and more
than he got from taxation. But the arithmetic of the pipe roll tells us a
good deal more than this. In 1129–30 the total sum due as a result of
offers made in this and previous years was almost £26,000, so only 14
per cent of the amount due was actually collected. William de Pont de
l’Arche, for example, had offered 1,000 marks for a chamberlainship and
in 1129–30 he paid just 100 marks. This meant that if the king were
satisfied with William’s behaviour, then payment of further instalments
might be suspended or pardoned. The expectation that the exchequer
would not press too hard had the effect of encouraging men to bid
highly. But a man who fell out of favour would find that he had to pay up
promptly – or get into even worse trouble. This, for example, was the
fate which befell William de Braose in John’s reign. In other words,
collecting only a small proportion of the amount due was not an

Medieval Britain

indication of chronic government inefficiency but rather of a further
refinement of an infinitely flexible system of patronage.

English Royal Revenues
Masterful kings always had their hands in their subjects’ pockets.
Edward I was known as Le Roi Coveytous just as William I had ‘loved
greediness above all’. At a more abstract level, as early as the twelfth
century it was asserted that royal power could be measured in financial
terms. In the words of Richard FitzNeal, bishop of London, Treasurer of
England, and author of The Dialogue of the Exchequer, a work dating
from the 1170s, ‘the power of princes fluctuates according to the ebb
and flow of their cash resources’. The pipe roll of 1129–30 – a record of
the accounts presented at the exchequer by sheriffs and other officials
in that year – shows an exchequer system already working very much
along the lines described in The Dialogue. But the financial system itself
certainly pre-dated the pipe roll. In broad outline – annual renders made
by sheriffs to the treasury – it is an Anglo-Saxon system. In 1066 and
1086 the renders produced by some large royal manors were still paid in
kind. By 1129–30 it is clear that a widespread commutation into money
52

alcuator

rents had taken place. This was in line with general European
development. The more the sheriffs’ renders were made in cash, the
greater the need for an easily followed but quick method of making
calculations in pounds, shillings, and pence. Thus the chequered table
cloth (from which the word exchequer is derived) served as a simplified
did sums by moving counters

from square to square like a croupier. The earliest reference to the
exchequer dates from 1110. Twice a year a group of the most powerful
and trusted men in the realm met in order to audit the sheriffs’
accounts. When the king was in Normandy they would meet, as the
vice-regal committee ‘at the exchequer’, in the king’s absence.
Presumably a similarly composed committee had met for a similar

But this is speculation. It is only when we reach 1129–30 that some
degree of precision is possible. Even here, however, we have to be
careful. An exchequer record, a pipe roll, tells almost nothing about
those sums which were paid into and out of the chamber. Certainly
these sums cannot be quantified, though in view of the fact that the
chamber was the financial office of the itinerant household, it is likely
that they were large. For example it was estimated that by 1187 Henry II
had paid 30,000 marks into his Jerusalem bank account, though there is
no sign of this money in the pipe rolls of his reign. In the absence of
twelfth-century chamber records, it is not easy to estimate total royal
revenue. Thus, the low pipe roll totals in the early years of Henry II’s
reign may be very largely a reflection of the new king’s preference for
chamber finance, a very natural preference for an Angevin prince, all of
whose forefathers had managed perfectly well without an exchequer.
After all, when it came to minting coins the Angevins introduced
Angevin practice into both England and Normandy. But, whatever the
difficulties, analysis of the only surviving pipe roll of Henry I’s reign is
undoubtedly revealing.
In 1129–30, £22,865 was paid into the treasury. Out of this total almost

source was a good deal less than it had been in 1129–30. Equally,
£20,000 under Henry I was probably worth more than £40,000 under
Edward I.)
The geld, the hide – the unit of land on which the geld was assessed –
and the fiscal machinery through which the geld was collected are all
further examples of those rights which the Norman kings inherited from
the Anglo-Saxons. Even though at two shillings on the hide the geld
contributed only 10 per cent of Henry I’s recorded income, it was clearly
a valuable royal asset. By 1129–30 it had become an annual tax and one
which could occasionally be levied at a higher rate (moreover geld
exemptions could be granted as political favours, adding yet another
by Henry II, in 1155–6 and 1161–2. Instead he developed other levies, the
aid of knights (scutage: assessed on knights’ fees) and the aid of
boroughs and cities (tallage: assessed on a valuation of movable
property). By John’s reign, scutages and tallages between them
constituted a more or less annual tax which adequately compensated
the Crown for the withering away of the geld. But the geld was not quite
dead. Under a new name, carucage, and a revised assessment it was
revived and levied four times between 1194 and 1220.
By this date, however, the government had discovered a new and
altogether more productive form of tax, assessed not on land but on an
estimate of a man’s revenues and movable property. Probably based on
the ecclesiastical tithe, it was initially used in 1166, 1185, and 1188 for a
pious purpose – the financial support of the Holy Land. John certainly
levied this tax on movables in 1207, and may have done so in 1203.
An account of the 1207 tax survives and the figures which it discloses
are astonishing. Levied at the rate of 1/13, it produced no less than
£60,000 – a sum far and away in excess of the yield of other taxes.
(Yet in 1194 this same tax had been levied at the rate of 1/4 – the heaviest
rate in the long history of the tax – in order to contribute to Richard’s
ransom.) In the mid-1190s the first national customs system was
55

string to the bow of royal patronage). But the geld was levied only twice

introduced. These developments suggest that royal revenues reached
new high levels during Richard’s and John’s reigns. By 1213–14 John
had accumulated some 200,000 marks. But these large accumulations
were soon spent. These were years of war, of the Third Crusade and
of the defence of the Angevin Empire. John’s final failure in 1214 ushered
in a long period of relative peace. Not until 1294 would the English
taxpayer once again find himself paying for a major European war.
In the meantime, however, there were two other significant thirteenthcentury innovations – the development of taxation of the clergy, and
the establishment of a customs system. Since 1199 the Church had been
made subject to an income tax imposed by the pope. Initially intended
to finance crusades, it was later used for a variety of ‘good causes’ – as
defined by the pope. Thus in 1217 Honorius III ordered bishops and

Medieval Britain

prelates to help out the boy-king Henry III. From then on the Church was
frequently required to subsidize the king, particularly if he had taken the
cross, as Henry III did in 1250 and Edward I did in 1287. In 1291, for
example, Edward received no less than 100,000 marks out of the
proceeds of a papal crusading tax. By the mid-thirteenth century it had
already become clear that the English Church was prepared to give
financial aid to the king – though, naturally, assemblies of clergy
haggled over the amount and took the opportunity of their meeting to
discuss other matters which they felt needed remedying. Hardly
surprising then that Henry III should go one step further in 1254 and ask
for a clerical grant without first seeking papal consent. This precedent
was followed in 1269, and then on three occasions by Edward I (1279/80,
1283, and 1290) in the years before 1294.
The customs duty in Richard’s and John’s reigns had been a war
measure; it lapsed when John sought a truce with Philip Augustus in
1206. The importance of the duty on wool exports established in 1275
was that it became a permanent addition to the Crown’s peacetime
revenue. Its yield varied according to the fortunes of the wool trade but
at the rate agreed in 1275, half a mark (6s. 8d.) per sack, it brought in
56

between £8,000 and £13,000 per annum in the years before 1294. These
new measures, papal taxation of the English Church and the customs
duty on wool, were both related to the presence of Italian mercantile
and banking houses in England. On the one hand, it was the ubiquitous
Italian businessman that enabled the thirteenth-century Papacy to
operate as an international finance corporation. On the other, credit
finance came to play an increasingly large part in government.
Edward I’s debt to the Ricciardi of Lucca for the years from 1272 to 1294
totalled nearly £400,000; 48 per cent of this debt was repaid out of the
customs receipt from a trade in which the Italians were increasingly
involved. Kings, of course, had borrowed before. In the 1250s, Henry III
owed the Ricciardi over £50,000; in the 1150s, Henry II used loans from a
Angevin Empire. What was significant in the late thirteenth century was
both the scale of the operations and the linkage between credit and
customs. Compared with the sums obtainable from these new sources,
the amounts to be derived from traditional levies, scutages, tallages,
and feudal aids, were hardly worth the trouble of collecting and they
gradually fell into disuse.

The Beginnings of Parliament in England
The customs system of 1275 had been granted in Parliament after
discussion between the king’s advisers and the merchants.
Characteristic of all these taxes was that someone else’s consent was
required: either the pope’s, or the merchants’, or the clergy’s, or the
country’s. By contrast, land, lordship, and jurisdiction were revenueproducing rights which did not require meetings of influential men to
approve their exploitation – indeed all influential men enjoyed similar
rights (though on a smaller scale) and presumably took them for
granted – so long as they were not abused. Whereas 85 per cent of
Henry I’s recorded revenue came from land, lordship, and jurisdiction,
they provided less than 40 per cent of Edward I’s. The higher the
proportion of crown revenue that came from taxation, the greater was
57

Politics, Law, and Religion in the Early Middle Ages

Flemish businessman, William Cade, to finance the making of the

the need for political mechanisms that enabled that consent to be
obtained. This is the process known as the growth of representative
institutions; in the case of the tax on movables it is the growth of
Parliament.
During the long years of freedom from foreign war after 1214 the tax on
movables remained an occasional resource of the Crown. War was
infrequent and other acceptable justifications for the tax were rare, so
consent was only occasionally forthcoming – certainly not as often as
Henry III would have liked. But the growing potential of the tax was
revealed by the last of the seven levies collected between 1208 and 1293:
the assessed yield of the 1/15 of 1290 was over £116,000. How was
consent to this extraordinary tax obtained? The king’s advisers would
have had to make a case. Presumably, they pointed to the expenses of

Medieval Britain

his recent stay in Gascony (1286–9) and of his future crusade; they may
well have pointed out that in the interests of Christian piety he was
sacrificing a lucrative source of revenue in deciding to expel the Jews –
although by 1290 the Jewish community had been squeezed so hard by
royal financial demands that it had little more to give. But to whom did
they make the case? They made it to the men who represented ‘the
community of the realm’ and, in the first instance, these were the
magnates – the sorts of influential men who always had attended major
political assemblies, whether Anglo-Saxon, Norman, or Angevin. The
assembly of 1290, ‘Parliament’ as it was now called, met from April to
July and in its first ten weeks it got through a great deal of business,
including some important legislation. In mid-July another group of men
arrived, knights of the shire. Less than a week later Parliament was
dissolved. Why had the knights been so belatedly summoned to attend?
Because the magnates were reluctant to approve the tax. They agreed
to it but ‘only insofar as they were entitled to’. Yet they had not been
similarly reluctant to deal with other kinds of parliamentary business,
judicial, political, legislative. In other words the magnates still
adequately represented ‘the community of the realm’ in most fields –
but not when taxation was on the agenda. From the late twelfth century
58

onwards, kings had grown accustomed to bargaining with individual
shire communities, so it was an obvious step to require these local
communities to choose men to speak for them on some of those
occasions when the king wanted to summon an assembly to represent
the community of the whole realm. Assemblies of magnates were being
reinforced in this way from the 1250s onwards and gradually the knights,
yeomen, and burgesses who represented shires and boroughs – the
Commons – were being accorded a more prominent role. As the
proceedings of the Parliament of 1290 make clear, it was above all else
the king’s need for taxation which stimulated this development.
Was the process also the result of social change? Was there a thirteenthinstitutions had to be reshaped? Did the gentry now count for more in
the localities so that if kings wanted their needs widely understood and
their taxes efficiently collected they had to offer them a place in the
main political forum of the realm? These are difficult questions, so
difficult indeed to answer in the affirmative that some historians have
argued that, on the contrary, the thirteenth century was a period of
crisis for the knightly class. One of the problems is a familiar one: the
growing volume of evidence. We know much more about the
thirteenth-century gentry than we do about their predecessors. But did
Simon de Montfort and his friends court the gentry more assiduously in
the period 1258–65 than John and the rebel barons had done in 1212–15?
Magna Carta contains clauses which appeal to wider social groups than
the barons, but so too does Henry I’s Coronation Charter. To whom was
Edward the Confessor appealing when, in 1051, he decided not to collect
the heregeld? Neither in the twelfth century nor in Anglo-Saxon times
did society consist only of barons and peasants. The sort of men who
got themselves chosen to be knights of the shire in the late thirteenth
century were exactly the sort of men who always had attended the
great political assemblies. True, they had come then in the retinues of
the magnates, but it was in their retinues that sensible magnates found
their best advisers – and presumably they had listened to them. The
59

Politics, Law, and Religion in the Early Middle Ages

century ‘rise of the gentry’ which meant that traditional political

knights of the late thirteenth century were not coming to these
meetings for the first time; they were simply coming under another
guise. It may be that the evidence of political change – the more
elaborate representative institutions of the thirteenth century, the
larger share of taxation in crown revenue – still has to be set within a
framework of underlying social continuity.

Law and Justice in England
From the reign of Henry II onwards, royal judges began to hold local
sessions (assizes) so frequently that it becomes possible to speak of the
application over almost the entire country of a common body of
customary law, the ‘common law’, the custom of the king’s court as
described in treatises such as ‘Glanvill’ and ‘Bracton’. The previous

Medieval Britain

system had been one in which, generally speaking, local courts had
applied local custom. Kings, of course, had long been held to be
responsible for law and order; in particular they were expected to deal
with serious offences, the pleas of the Crown, but until a regular,
centrally directed machinery of justice was established, their activity in
this field could only be sporadic. They intervened when influential
people were involved and they launched occasional drives against theft,
especially cattle-rustling. In this respect, the Anglo-Saxon system of
justice survived the Norman Conquest. The change came in 1166 with
the Assize of Clarendon, reinforced in 1176 by the Assize of
Northampton. These assizes introduced regular measures for the trial by
royal judges of those suspected of serious crimes. At first Henry II’s
judges were simply men whom the king trusted – they might be earls,
barons, bishops, abbots, or counsellors from the royal household,
exactly the sort of people whom earlier kings had sent out on specific
commissions of justice or inquiry – the biggest and most famous of such
inquiries being the Domesday survey. For men such as these, holding
courts of law was just one of the many tasks, administrative, diplomatic,
and military, which they carried out on the king’s behalf. But the
introduction of frequent circuits meant an ever-increasing burden of
60

judicial work and by the end of the twelfth century we can identify a
group of men, most of them laymen, who specialized in legal business,
in effect professional judges. There were, of course, lower courts dealing
with less serious offences, but the ‘professional’ courts increasingly
came to dominate the field. For one thing the lower courts had no
authority to innovate, whereas the king could, and did, create new
offences. For example the crime of conspiracy was ‘invented’ in 1279
when Edward I ordered the itinerant judges to inquire into
confederacies to defeat the ends of justice. Since the king’s courts dealt
not only with crime but also with disputes concerning property, they
were clearly felt to be performing a useful service. Magna Carta
criticized many aspects of royal government, but not this one. Indeed it
more frequently than was in practice possible.
The judges were men learned in the law; being learned, they naturally
responded to shifts in attitudes and ideas prevailing within educated
opinion. One such shift was in the direction of a self-consciously rational
approach to intellectual problems – an approach typified by Abelard’s
dictum: ‘By doubting we come to inquiry, by inquiring we come to
perceive the truth.’ When applied to the law, this was a dictum which
could have far-reaching implications. For example, if the guilt or
innocence of a suspect could not readily be determined, it had for
centuries been customary to send him to the ordeal, usually the ordeal
of hot iron or the ordeal of water. This system worked well enough while
people believed in it – it relied on the same psychological insight as the
modern lie-detector – but was highly vulnerable to doubt. If an innocent
man came to doubt the ordeal’s efficacy as the means whereby God
would prove his innocence, then he was all the more likely to fail the
ordeal. Once raised, these doubts could not be stilled. At first they
seemed shocking – as when voiced by William Rufus – but eventually
they became conventional. Finally, in 1215 Pope Innocent III forbade the
participation of priests in the ordeal and, in England at least, this meant
that the system came to an abrupt end. After an initial period of
61

Politics, Law, and Religion in the Early Middle Ages

asked that the king’s judges should visit each shire four times a year,

confusion, trial by ordeal was replaced by trial by jury: this was a
method which had already been used with some success in settling
disputes about possession of land. In 1179 Henry II had ordered that, in a
case concerning property rights, the defendant might opt for trial by
jury rather than trial by battle – the method which had been introduced
into England by the Normans and the efficacy of which, like the ordeal,
was vulnerable to doubt. But this rule when applied to criminal justice
meant that there was a trial only when the accused opted for one.
Obviously he came under great pressure. By a statute of 1275 he was
condemned to a ‘prisone forte et dure’ until he did opt for trial. In
consequence, many men died in prison, but because they had not been
convicted, their property was not forfeited to the Crown. For this reason
some chose to die rather than risk trial. Not until the eighteenth century

Medieval Britain

was this right to choose taken away.
At first, and particularly in property litigation, juries had been called
upon to settle straightforward questions to which they might
reasonably be expected to know the answer. But problems arose when
more complicated cases came before them and when trial by jury
replaced the ordeal. For, unlike God, a jury was not omniscient. So
efforts were made to cut through the complexities of any given dispute
in order to isolate a specific question which the jury could fairly be
expected to decide. But to do this well required specialized knowledge
and skill; in other words it needed professional lawyers. And so, in the
course of the thirteenth century, a legal profession developed, with its
own schools, its own literature, and its own language (law French).
Despite all these changes, in many fundamental respects Anglo-Saxon
attitudes towards justice continued to flourish. In the Anglo-Saxon and
Anglo-Norman periods, serious offences had been dealt with under a
procedure which ended with the guilty party being required to pay
compensation to the victim or his family. The new machinery of justice
established by the Angevins tended to impose punishment without
compensation. In many cases, homicide, wounding, and rape, for
62

example, this was felt to be intolerable, so despite the impression given
by writers such as ‘Glanvill’ and ‘Bracton’ who would have us believe
that the new principles had effectively displaced the old, it seems that in
reality the old procedures survived; they were adapted and grafted on
to the new. What this meant was that those who could afford it escaped
punishment but paid compensation to the victim or his kin, while those
who could not, suffered the consequences.

Church and Religion
Domesday Book suggests that the village priest was usually reckoned to
be a member of the peasant community. His church belonged to the
went with that estate might also have to be divided. In many ways, the
village priest shared the life-style of the ordinary villager. He was very
unlikely to be celibate; indeed, he was probably married and may well
have inherited his position from his father. Given this basic situation,
one can only admire the temerity of those eleventh-century reformers
who aimed to abolish both lay control of the Church and the family life
of the clergy. Under papal stimulus, the campaign for reform reached
England in 1076. In subsequent decades, it was gradually stepped up
and in the long run it even had a kind of success. By the late thirteenth
century, married clergy were exceptional. On the other hand, plenty of
them – including some of the most powerful – continued to have
mistresses. Ranulf Flambard of Durham and Roger of Salisbury had their
counterparts almost 200 years later in Walter Langton of Coventry, who
was accused of strangling his mistress’s husband, and Robert Burnell,
Edward I’s chancellor, whom the king twice tried to have translated
from Bath and Wells to Canterbury. As far as lay patronage and family
connection were concerned, these two aspects of church life were
hardly touched. ‘The Lord deprived bishops of sons, but the devil gave
them nephews.’
Yet even the limited success of the campaign against clerical marriage is

local lord. If an estate were divided then the profits of the church which

remarkable – given how ineffective decrees on this subject had been in
the 700 years from the fourth century onwards. It may well be linked
with the general improvement in education in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. If society at large became more literate then the
clergy could more readily be recruited from the laity; they did not have
to remain what they had come close to being, a hereditary caste. The
more people went to school, the more they learned to know, and some
of them to respect, the ancient law of the Church. Certainly there is
reason to believe that in thirteenth-century England a higher proportion
of the population was celibate than had been in the eleventh century.
Quite simply, there were far more people who had taken vows of
chastity. Everywhere in Europe monasticism flourished and Britain was
no exception. In England, for example, there were some fifty religious
houses in 1066 and perhaps 1,000 monks and nuns. By 1216 there were

Medieval Britain

approximately 700 houses and some 13,000 monks, nuns, canons, and
canonesses. A century later, the total was nearer 900 houses and 17,500
members of the religious orders. Seen in the context of an overall
tripling of the population, these are impressive figures. Even so they fail
to make plain the extent to which, throughout Britain, religious life had
become diversified and enriched. In the eleventh century, all the houses
were Benedictine in type. By the mid-thirteenth century not only were
there several hundred Benedictine houses, there were also a number of
new orders from which a man or woman could choose – regular canons,
Cistercians, Gilbertines (the one peculiarly English order), Templars,
Hospitallers, Carthusians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and
Austin friars. Within this framework, almost every conceivable variety of
religious life, rural, urban, contemplative, ascetic, active, was now
catered for. What is more, most of those who entered the religious life
now did so because they chose to. Whereas the old Benedictine
houses had recruited their monks largely from the children given by
their aristocratic parents to be brought up in the cloister (oblates),
from the mid-twelfth century onwards those who entered both the
new and the old orders were adults. The Cistercians, who established
the new pattern, prohibited entry for anyone under the age of 16 and
64

insisted upon a year’s noviciate. Conscripts had been replaced by
volunteers.
During the course of the twelfth century, the English Church
established the diocesan and parochial organization under which it was
to live for centuries. The last new dioceses to be created were Ely (in
1108) and Carlisle (1133). Dioceses were divided into archdeaconries, and
archdeaconries into rural deaneries. In the Norman period, as before,
new parishes were created almost at will – the will of the local lord; but
thereafter it became much harder. The territorial organization of the
Church became, as it were, frozen in its twelfth-century state. This was
certainly not because demographic and economic expansion was now
and the old ones continued to grow. What was happening was that the
development of canon law and of papal jurisdiction was tending to
protect innumerable vested interests. The rise of the lawyer, itself the
result of change in one sphere of life, made it harder to change things in
others. Where this created a real pastoral problem was in the towns.
Bishops wrestled with the problem but much of their effort was
frustrated by the proprietary interests of patrons, churchmen as well as
laymen. The thirteenth century found a solution, but it needed a radical
departure, a new form of religious life, to make it possible. This new
form was provided by the mendicant orders, the friars – mobile
missionaries whose international organization cut clean through
diocesan and parochial boundaries. The first friars to come to England
were the Dominicans. They arrived in 1221 and headed for Oxford. Three
years later, the Franciscans arrived; their earliest friaries were in
Canterbury, London, and Oxford. The Carmelites and Austin friars
arrived in the 1240s. By 1300 the friars had founded some 150 houses in
England, more than 20 in Scotland and nine in Wales.
The coming of the friars, like the growth of canon law, is a movement
which reflects one of the basic circumstances of the Church throughout
Britain. Although its growing material wealth was firmly rooted in
65

levelling off. On the contrary, new settlements continued to be founded

English, Welsh, or Scottish soil, in its spiritual, intellectual, and
corporate life as a Church it was increasingly a part of Latin
Christendom. This was particularly true of the period from the late
eleventh century onwards, when both Latin and French became more
widely used than before in England as well as in Scotland and Wales.
Particularly important was the Gregorian reform movement and the
associated development of canon law and papal jurisdiction over the
entire Latin Church. The reformers’ demand for libertas ecclesiae, the
privileged freedom of the Church, undeniably had some dramatic
consequences; but in the end it turned out to be unobtainable. While
liberty was linked with privilege and the continued possession of great
corporate wealth, kings and other secular patrons could not afford to
renounce some of their crucial powers, in particular the power to
appoint, even though by the thirteenth century they were having to

Medieval Britain

work through the legal machinery of the Roman curia in order to obtain
their ends. The fact was that the spiritual weapons at the Church’s
disposal, excommunication and interdict, were ultimately insufficient to
deter the secular power. They tended, moreover, to become blunted
through over-use. In areas which really mattered to the lay world, not
just patronage but also war, tournaments, and business practice, the
heroic days of the Gregorian reform gradually, in the course of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, gave way to a period of
accommodation. But where the reformers did succeed was in
translating the theory of papal headship of the Church into the fact of a
centralized system of government. To a quite remarkable extent, the
clergy learned to do what the pope told them to do. Thus when Pope
Innocent III, in pursuit of his quarrel with King John, laid an interdict on
England, the clergy obeyed. For six years, from 1208 to 1214, the church
doors were closed and the laity were locked out; they were denied the
sacrament of the altar, solemnization of marriages, burial in
consecrated ground. Even when the pope, beginning in 1199, ordered
the taxation of the Church, the clergy grumbled but paid up. From 1228
onwards we can trace a continuous series of resident collectors in
England; they bore the title of nuncio and almost all of them were
66

Italians. Here too there was accommodation. It seemed realistic to win
the king of England’s approval and so, by 1300, it was the king who
received the lion’s share of the proceeds.
Throughout this period, Catholic Christianity remained the
unchallenged religion. It was taken for granted. When the churches
were closed for six years there was hardly a murmur of public protest –
but neither was there an upsurge of interest in alternative religions.
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, heresy was no more of a
threat than it had been in the eleventh: in this respect Britain was
different from many parts of Europe. Throughout this period a few
non-Christians – Jews – lived in towns as far north as Newcastle and
but their position was always precarious, at times painfully so, and in
1290 they were expelled. Most Christians rejoiced.

The Economy in the Early
Middle Ages

The basic outline of the English economy in 1086 emerges very clearly
from the repetitive, laconic phrases of Domesday Book. This was a
fundamentally agrarian economy. Over 90 per cent of the people lived
in the country and earned their daily bread and ale from the resources
of the land. The land was already well settled – some 13,000 settlements
are named – and much cultivated. As much as 80 per cent of the arable
acreage of 1914 had been under the plough in 1086. Pasture, woodland,
and fen were also exploited. Most men were farmers and fishers. In
highland Britain, beyond the reach of Domesday Book, farmers grew
oats and barley rather than wheat, and there were more cattle than
sheep. Neither trade nor industry could offer a major alternative source
of employment. Domesday statistics – though they have to be used as
cautiously as any other statistics – can help to fill out the picture. People
called villani comprised the most numerous class (41 per cent of the
total recorded population). Their land holdings came to about 45 per
cent of all the land. The next largest number (32 per cent) were the
people known as ‘bordars’ or ‘cottars’; they held only 5 per cent of the
land. Thus, although there were enormous individual variations, it is
clear that we are dealing with two distinct classes: those who had a
substantial stake in the village fields and those who possessed hardly
more than a cottage and its garden. In addition there were the 14 per
cent of the total who were described either as ‘free men’ or ‘sokemen’.
Since they held a fifth of the land they seem to belong, economically
68

speaking, to the same class as the villani. Finally there were the slaves, 9
per cent of the recorded population, who held no land.
At the other end of the social scale were the king and a tiny group of
powerful men, all of them rentiers who lived in style on the revenues of
their great estates. Fewer than 200 laymen and roughly 100 major
churches (bishoprics, abbeys, and priories) held between them about
three-quarters of the assessed value of the whole country. These men –
in legal terminology they were known as the king’s tenants-in-chief –
had tenants of their own. A wealthy baron like William de Warenne, for
example, had granted out holdings worth about £540 out of an estate
valued at over £1,150. Some of these subtenants were men described as
knights and their tenancies as knights’ fees. (Although many of the

different social group.) The rest of a tenant-in-chief’s estates – usually
between a half and three-quarters of them – were kept ‘in demesne’,
and it was from these demesne lands that a lord drew the bulk of his
income and food. A monastic house, with a fixed centre, needed regular
supplies of foodstuffs, but other great landlords, who were more
peripatetic, would probably be more interested in money. Most
demesnes therefore were leased – ‘farmed’ was the technical term – in
return for a money rent. Most of the lessees came from exactly the
same range of social ranks as did the holders of knights’ fees; together
they constituted a landowning ‘middle class’, a gentry.
What happened to the English economy in the 200 years after 1086?
Even over so long a period as this it can be argued that, in many
fundamental respects, there was little change. England was no more
urbanized in 1286 than in 1086. True, there were more and larger towns
but then there were more people altogether. There were undoubtedly
striking improvements in ship design – a continuing feature of northern
Europe from the eighth century onwards. In this period it meant, above
all, the development of the ‘cog’, a large, tubby bulk-carrier with a
69

knights were no richer than the richest villani the fact remains that they
lived in closer association with their lords and therefore belonged to a

stern-post rudder and a deep draught. This meant economies of scale in
the maritime trade which had long linked the east coast with the
Scandinavian world and the west with the Atlantic coast of France.
Presumably the volume of trade in wool, cloth, timber, salted fish, and
wine was increasing and merchants’ profits may well have been
increasing too. Even so there was no English commercial revolution, no
development of banks and credit facilities of the kind that can be
claimed for thirteenth-century Italy. One consequence of this relative
backwardness was that in the thirteenth century an increasingly high
proportion of England’s foreign trade came to be in Italian hands. Their
reserves of liquid capital enabled Italian companies to offer attractive
terms. They could not only buy an abbey’s entire wool clip for the
current year; they could also buy it for years in advance. By lending large
sums to Henry III and Edward I, they obtained royal patronage and
protection. In a very real sense late thirteenth-century England was
being treated as a partially developed economy. Much of its import–
export business was handled by foreigners (Gascons and Flemings as
70

well as Italians). Its main exports were raw materials – wool and grain –
rather than manufactured goods. There had been, in other words, no
industrial revolution.
Throughout this period the major industries remained the same ones:
cloth, building, mining and metalworking, salt production, and sea
fishing. Moreover, despite the claims sometimes made for the clothfulling mill, there were no significant advances in industrial technology.
Nor was there anything to compare with the highly capitalized
development of the Flemish cloth industry in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. On the other hand growing Flemish demand for English wool
did help to preserve the favourable balance of trade which, throughout
this period, ensured an inflow of bullion sufficient to maintain the one
rapidly developing and more highly monetized regions, people used a
much debased coinage to perform the economic function of small
change. In this sense too the English economy saw comparatively little
change.)
Above all there was no agricultural revolution. Despite the fact that
thirteenth-century experts on estate management, men such as Walter
of Henley or Henry of Eastry, approached their job in a rational and
scientific manner, the technical limitations under which they worked
meant that no significant increase in yields was possible, neither from
sheep in terms of weight of fleece, nor from seed in terms of yield of
grain. Though the use of the horse as a draught animal was spreading,
this was of marginal importance. The main problems lay not in
ploughing, but in sowing, reaping, and maintaining soil fertility. Sowing
and reaping by hand was wasteful and slow. Marl and most other types
of fertilizer were either expensive or unobtainable. Only animal dung
was generally available and it was widely and systematically used. But
the high costs of feeding flocks and herds through the winter meant
that there were upper limits to the amount of dung that could be
produced. And unless there were basic improvements in primary
71

coin, the silver penny, at a consistently fine standard. (Whereas in more

production – as there were not – improvements at the second stage of
production, for example the introduction of windmills around 1200,
could only be of marginal economic importance. Thus in many respects
England remained a stagnant economy. It can indeed be argued that, by
comparison with some of its neighbours, especially Flanders and Italy,
England was less advanced in the thirteenth century than it had been in
the eleventh. But this is a modern perspective. In twelfth- and
thirteenth-century England people felt they lived in a country which was
economically advanced by comparison with the lands of their Celtic
neighbours.

Having said all this, it must be made clear that in one vital respect there

Medieval Britain

had been considerable change. By the late thirteenth century there
were far more people living in Britain than there had been in 1086 –

notwithstanding the fact that men and women were familiar with co

as a method of birth control. Exactly how many people there

were, it is impossible to say. Estimating the English population at the
time of the Domesday survey is an extremely difficult task. Most
historians would put it at between 1.25 and 2.25 millions. Estimating the
late thirteenth-century English population is yet more hazardous. Some
historians would go as high as 7 millions; others would put it much
lower, perhaps 5 millions. Estimating the populations of Scotland and
Wales is even more hazardous still. Recent guesses suggest 0.5 to 1
million for Scotland c.1300, and about 0.25 million for Wales. But most
historians agree that the population more than doubled in this period.
The hypothesis of slow growth from the eleventh (or perhaps indeed
from the tenth) century, followed by an acceleration from the end of the
twelfth century onwards, seems to be a plausible one. But not only did
rates of growth vary (probably) over time; they also varied (certainly) in
space. Thus the population of the North Riding of Yorkshire probably
increased some twelvefold in the 200 years after 1086; elsewhere, and
particularly in those areas which were already relatively densely settled

have actually led to a decrease in droppings. This in turn could have led
to soil exhaustion and lower, rather than higher, yields. Whether or not
yields did decline towards the end of the thirteenth century, one thing
that does seem clear is that, if the physical limit of cultivation were
reached and population still continued to grow, then one of two things
would have to happen. Either more food would be imported or the
average standard of living would have to fall. There is no evidence that
grain imports rose. If anything the trend was probably in the opposite
direction. English grain dealers took their merchandise in bulk-carrying
ships to regions such as Flanders, Gascony, and Norway, that is, to
places where industrialization or specialization had reached a higher
pitch than in England and where regional economics were geared to the
import of basic foodstuffs in return for cloth, wine, and forest products.
make it clear that the average size of tenant holdings was shrinking. In
this period more people means less land per head.

The Free, the Servile, and the Poor
Despite this gloomy picture, many thirteenth-century villagers may
have been better off than their predecessors at the time of Domesday
Book. They were relatively free from the devastation caused by war.
None of them was a slave. Slavery is a feature of economies
characterized by labour shortage; as population, and therefore the
supply of labour, rose, so slavery declined. True, many of them were
serfs (or villeins) – perhaps as much as half the total population –
whereas the villani and cottagers of Domesday Book (three-quarters of
the listed population) were free. But although the villani and cottagers
were free inasmuch as they were not slaves, it is clear that they were not
very free – thus the existence of the much smaller Domesday class (only
14 per cent of those listed) called precisely ‘free men’. What made life
difficult for the villani and cottagers was that their lords were free too –
free and powerful. They were free to manipulate custom in order to
impose as many burdens as they could, and in a period of relative labour
75

The Economy in the Early Middle Ages

Moreover the abundant estate records of thirteenth-century England

shortage this is likely to have meant a heavy regime of labour services:
at times like this lords would not be content to pay wages at levels set
by the market. Only as supply rose would lords increasingly turn to the
alternative of wage labour. In the twelfth century, many tenants found
their obligations converted from labour service to payment of a money
rent. At this point, the development of the legalistic outlook becomes
important. In the decades either side of the year 1200, the king’s judges
formulated rules to determine who had the right to have their disputes
heard in the royal courts and who had not. They decided that those who
had the right were ‘free’, while those who had not were ‘servile’. The
effect of this classification of society into two distinct categories was to
enserf half the population: to make them legally unfree. But what the
lawyers took with one hand they gave with the other. The more
everything came to be defined and written down, the more customary

Medieval Britain

tenures tended to become ‘frozen’ in that state in which they were
written down. It became less easy to manipulate custom; more
effectively than before custom tended to protect the status quo. In this
sense, even unfree tenants in the thirteenth century were less
vulnerable to the arbitrary exactions of individual lords than many free
tenants of the eleventh century had been. Thirteenth-century lords who
tried to manipulate custom often found themselves involved in long
legal battles with well-organized village communities.
But although customary law may have offered a poor tenant some
protection from his lord’s demands, it could do nothing to protect him
from the grim realities of economic change. In the years either side of
1200, half the villagers of England may have been enserfed, but this
mattered little compared with the fact that poor villagers became still
poorer. Those who really suffered towards the end of the thirteenth
century were not servile tenants as such, but those tenants, whether
free or servile, who were poor and those who had no land at all. We
know something about tenants. Mortality rates on the Winchester
manors suggest that from 1250 onwards the poorer tenants were
becoming increasingly ‘harvest-sensitive’ – a euphemistic phrase
76

meaning that, with each bad harvest, more of them died, either of
starvation or of the diseases attendant upon malnutrition. Study of the
West Midlands manor of Halesowen suggests that poor tenants there –
the successors of the cottagers of Domesday – had a life expectancy
some ten years less than the better-off tenants, the successors of the
Domesday villani. What happened to the landless we can only guess; the
nature of the evidence is such that they rarely find themselves
mentioned in thirteenth-century records. Labourers on great estates
customarily received not only cash but also an allowance of grain
sufficient to sustain a family. But what about those landless labourers
who became surplus to the economy? Presumably they also became
‘harvest-sensitive’.

But the economic clouds which brought misery for the poor were
nicely lined with silver for the rich. The growth of population meant
an increasing demand for food. Prices rose, particularly around 1200
and in the late thirteenth century. On the other hand, a plentiful
supply of labour meant that money wage rates, both for piece-work
and for day-work, remained stable throughout the century. Real
wages, in other words, fell. In these circumstances, wealthy
landowners could do very well. Selling their surplus produce on the
market brought increasing profits. Markets proliferated. Between 1198
and 1483 some 2,400 grants of market were made by the Crown and
of these over half came in the period before 1275. Equally a rising
demand for tenancies meant growing rent-rolls. To take just one
example, the bishop of Ely’s net income rose from £920 in 1171–2 to
£2,550 in 1298. But this does not quite mean that all the fortunate
possessor of a great estate had to do was sit back and let the laws of
supply and demand do their work for him. In the twelfth century, as
before, most of the manors belonging to a wealthy tenant-in-chief
were in fact held by his tenants, either as knights’ fees or leased out
at fixed rents to ‘farmers’. At a time of stability or gradual expansion,
77

The Economy in the Early Middle Ages

Management of Estates

this made good sense; from the lord’s point of view it kept his
administrative costs down to a minimum. The stability of the system
is indicated by the fact that long-term leases for a life or for several
lives were common, and that these long-term grants tended to turn
into hereditary tenures.
But the steep rise in prices around 1200 created severe problems for the
lord living on fixed rents. If he, rather than his tenants, were to take
advantage of the market economy, then he had to switch to direct
management of his manors. To abandon an age-old system was not
easy and many lords encountered fierce resistance from their tenants,
but gradually it was done. The most famous description of the process
can be read in Jocelin of Brakelond’s account of the business-like life of
Abbot Samson of Bury St Edmunds (abbot 1182–1211). The landlord took

Medieval Britain

his estates into his own hands, appointed bailiffs and reeves to run them
and sell the surplus on the open market. Under this new regime, the
lord’s expenses and profits were going to vary from year to year. This
would have made it very easy for his officials to cheat him unless a close
check were kept on their activities. So a detailed record of the manorial
year was drawn up and then sent, together with similar returns from the
other manors, to be checked by auditors who represented the central
administration of a great estate. (The survival of masses of these
accounts means that we know a great deal about some aspects of the
thirteenth-century English rural economy.) The auditors had a policymaking as well as a fraud-detecting role. They fixed targets for each
manor, the levels of production of grain and livestock which had to be
reached. They took investment decisions, whether to build new barns,
whether to buy fertilizers, and so on. Inspired by these concerns a whole
new literature was born, treatises on agriculture and estate
management, of which Walter of Henley’s Husbandry is the most
famous. All these changes presupposed the existence of widespread
practical literacy: without this it would not have been possible to carry
through the managerial revolution – for that is what it was – of the early
thirteenth century.
78

The whole point of the new system was to maximize the lord’s profits,
and to do so in as rational a way as possible. It seems unlikely that this
was an approach which was going to concern itself with the problems
facing the poor, the lame ducks of the economic system, nearly all of
whom were born lame. At a manorial level there are innumerable cases
of resistance to a lord’s demands, both passive resistance and direct,
sometimes legal, action. In the towns, too, there is increasing evidence
of a struggle between rich and poor. Despite the ‘safety valve’ of the
opportunities provided by migration into Celtic lands, it looks as though
by the 1290s England was a country choked with people, a traditional
economy unable to cope with the strains of population pressure, even
perhaps a land on the brink of class warfare.

England at War, 1290–1390

To those who lived at the time, and to many historians since, the late
Middle Ages, from c.1290, seemed a dangerous, turbulent, and
decadent period. England’s civil and foreign wars – especially those in
Scotland, France, and the Low Countries – lasted longer, extended
further afield, cost more, and involved larger numbers of men than any
it had fought since the Viking Age. Within the British Isles, Welshmen
were distrusted by the English, despite Edward I’s conquests; uprisings
culminating in Owain Glyndŵr’s rebellion (from 1400) seemed to justify
this distrust and recall prophecies that foretold of the expulsion of the
English from Wales. Celtic prejudice against Englishmen flourished with
all the bitterness and resentment of which the defeated or oppressed
were capable: ‘The tyranny and cruelty of the English’, claimed a Scot in
1442, ‘are notorious throughout the world, as manifestly appears in
their usurpations against the French, Scots, Welsh, Irish and
neighbouring lands.’ Famine, disease, and (from 1348) plague drastically
reduced England’s population by the early fifteenth century, perhaps by
as much as a half, and this severely disrupted English society. Towards
the end of the fifteenth century, French statesmen were noting with
disapproval Englishmen’s habit of deposing and murdering their kings
and the children of kings (as happened in 1327, 1399, 1461, 1471, 1483,
and 1485) with a regularity unmatched anywhere else in Western
Europe. Spiritual uncertainty and the spread of heresy led the choleric
Chancellor of Oxford University, Dr Thomas Gascoigne, to conclude that
80

the English Church of his day was decayed, and its bishops and clergy
failing in their duty. One popular poet, writing about 1389, thought that
this seemingly decadent age was all too appropriately reflected in the
extravagant and indecent fashion for padded shoulders, tightly drawn
waistbands, close-fitting hose, and long pointed shoes.
There are, of course, dangers in taking contemporaries at their own
estimation, particularly if they lived at times of special tension or
turmoil. It is now accepted that wars can have a creative side, in this
case giving Englishmen a sharper sense of national identity; that famine
and disease need not utterly prostrate a society, or economic
contraction necessarily mean economic depression; that the growth of

King’svigny

heresy and criticism of religious institutions may spur men to greater
personal devotion; that, as with the evolution of Parliament, political
accomplishments are rarely extinguished by civil commotion or social
ferment. From the vantage point of the beginning of the twenty-first
century, the later Middle Ages now appear as an age of turbulence and
complexity, sure enough, but also as an age of vitality, ambition, and,
above all, fascination.

The

So ere

t

The king and his court, with the royal family and household at its centre,
were the focus and fulcrum of English government and politics. Central
to both was the relationship between the king and his influential
subjects: the barons or magnates first and foremost, but also country
knights and esquires who often aspired to join the baronial ranks,
wealthy merchants, and the bishops and talented clerks – all of whom
sought patronage, position, and promotion from the Crown. A
successful king was one who established a harmonious relationship with
all or most of these influential subjects, for only then could political
stability, effective government, and domestic peace be assured. This
was no simple or easy task. The growing emphasis on the king’s
81

England at War, 1290–1390

crises have constructive features; and, finally, that literary and artistic

sovereign authority in his kingdom, reinforced by the principle (from
1216) that the Crown should pass to the eldest son of the dead monarch
and by the extension of royal administration in the hands of a network
of king’s clerks and servants, was bound to be at the expense of the
feudal, regional power of the great landowners. Yet that very principle
of hereditary monarchy, while it reduced the likelihood of royal kinsmen

ales
nquesfW

squabbling over the Crown, made it more likely that unsuitable kings
(by their youth, character, or incapacity) would sometimes wear it.
Above all, the persistent warfare of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries imposed heavier obligations on England’s kings. From
Edward I’s reign onwards, there was no decade when Englishmen were
not at war, whether overseas or in the British Isles. Every generation of
Englishmen in the later Middle Ages knew the demands, strains, and

Medieval Britain

consequences of war – and more intensely than their forebears.

The Co

to

After the civil war of Henry III’s reign, a successful effort was made to
reconcile England and restore domestic peace whereby the king and his
subjects could re-establish a stable relationship that gave due regard to
the rights and aspirations of both. The new monarch, Edward I (1272–
1307), showed himself to be capable, constructive, and efficient in his
government, and also determined to emphasize his position as
sovereign. But his unrelenting insistence on asserting his sovereignty in
all the territories of the British Isles, even those beyond the borders of
his realm, began the era of perpetual war.
In Wales, he overwhelmed Gwynedd, the most vigorous and
independent of the surviving native lordships, and with Llywelyn ap
Gruffydd’s death in 1282 the conquest of Wales was successfully
completed after 200 years of intermittent warfare. The Crown thereby
expanded its territories in North and West Wales to form a principality
that covered half the country; in 1361 this was conferred on the king’s
eldest son as the first English-born Prince of Wales. It was a notable

achievement, if a costly one. Material damage had to be made good;
an imaginative plan for future security included a dozen new and
half-a-dozen reconstructed fortresses, most of them complemented
by new walled boroughs peopled by loyal immigrants; and a
permanent administration was devised for the conquered lands. This
administration (announced in the statute of Rhuddlan, 1284) began as a
military regime but soon established peace and stability by a judicious
combination of English innovation and Welsh practice. Firmness,
tempered by fairness and conciliation, was the hallmark of relations
between the new governors and the Welsh population, and rebellions in
1287, 1294–5, and 1316 were not widespread or dangerous threats. Yet
the costs of conquest were prodigious. Soldiers and sailors, architects,
craftsmen, and labourers were recruited in every English county and
beyond to serve in Wales. At least £75,000 was spent on castle-building

Medieval Britain

between 1277 and 1301 alone (when a skilled mason earned less than 2s.
a week), whilst the suppression of the 1294–5 revolt cost about
£55,000. Fortunately, royal government in Wales proved eminently
successful: by the mid-fourteenth century it was producing a profit for
the royal exchequer and the Welsh gentry prospered in co-operation
with an alien regime.
No sooner had Llywelyn been eliminated than Edward I turned to the
lords of the Welsh march (or borderland) – mostly English magnates – to
establish his sovereign rights over them and their subjects too; and he
brought the Welsh Church and bishops more directly under his control.
The whole enterprise of Edwardian conquest showed an imagination
and determination and a grasp of strategy that went far beyond the
military campaigns. But the feelings of bitterness among the
conquered, who were ruled in Church and State by an alien hierarchy,
could not easily be removed. If English domination were to become
oppressive, if the economic benefits of stable rule dried up, or if
relations between native and immigrant deteriorated, serious problems
would be created for the English state, and colonial rule would be
threatened.
84

Overlordship in Scotland
Edward I was equally intent on exerting his superior lordship over
Scotland. This was an exceptionally ambitious undertaking because
Scotland, unlike Wales, had its own monarch (of the house of Canmore)
and Scotsmen’s sense of independence was fierce, especially in the
remoter Highlands. But, as with Wales, an opportunity to assert
England’s overlordship had arisen in Edward’s reign in 1286 on the death
of King Alexander III and of his granddaughter and heiress four years
later. Edward accepted the invitation of the Scottish ‘guardians of the
realm’ to settle the succession question, and he took advantage of this
‘Great Cause’ (1291–2) to secure recognition of himself as ‘lord superior’
of Scotland. Scottish resistance and Edward’s efforts to make his claim a
reality began a barren period of mutual hostility between the two
French aid (1295) and papal support, and they generated a vigorous
patriotism in defence of their political independence under the
leadership of William Wallace (executed 1305) and Robert Bruce (King
Robert I, 1306–29). A score of English invasions in the half-century after
1296 succeeded in establishing an uneasy military and administrative
presence in the Lowlands, but it was difficult to sustain in poor and
hostile country and had to be financed largely from England. Nor did the
English command the northern seas or subdue and control the north
and west of Scotland. Thus, the English had none of the advantages – or
success – that attended their ventures in Wales, and even in battle
(notably at Bannockburn, 1314) their cavalry forces suffered humiliating
defeat at the hands of more mobile Scotsmen. The treaty of
Northampton (1328), which recognized King Robert and surrendered
the English claim to overlordship, was quickly disowned by Edward III
when he took personal charge of the government in 1330. AngloScottish relations thereafter were a sad catalogue of invasion, border
raids, unstable English occupation of southern shires, Franco-Scottish
agreements that hardened into the ‘Auld Alliaunce’ – even the capture
of King David II at Neville’s Cross (1346). Scotland proved a persistent
85

England at War, 1290–1390

countries that lasted well into the sixteenth century. The Scots sought

and expensive irritation after English claims and ambitions were
thwarted by determined and united resistance by the Scots.

Ireland
After Bannockburn, Robert I tried to forestall further English operations
in Scotland by exploiting the situation in Ireland. During 1315–18 his
brother, Edward Bruce, secured the support of Anglo-Irish magnates
and Gaelic chiefs, and in 1316 he was declared High King of Ireland. Soon
afterwards, Robert himself visited Ireland and this may have been
designed to stimulate a ‘pan-Celtic’ movement against Edward II of
England (1307–27). This Scottish intervention was a severe shock to the
English government and revealed the weakness of its regime in Dublin.
No English king visited Ireland between 1210 and 1394 – not even

Medieval Britain

Edward I, conqueror of the Welsh and ‘hammer of the Scots’. Instead,
Edward I ruthlessly stripped the country of its resources of men, money,
and supplies, especially for his wars and castle-building in Wales and
Scotland. Harsh exploitation and absentee rule led in time to
administrative abuse and the decay of order, of which the Anglo-Irish
magnates and Gaelic chiefs took full advantage. The king’s officials
presided over an increasingly feeble and neglected administration,
whilst a Gaelic political and cultural revival had taken root in the
thirteenth century. This contributed to the success of Edward Bruce,
during whose ascendancy Ireland, said a contemporary, ‘became one
trembling wave of commotion’. The English lordship never recovered
and henceforward was unable to impose its authority throughout the
island. Instead of being a financial resource, Ireland became a financial
liability, with a revenue after 1318 that was a third of what it had been
under Edward I and therefore quite inadequate to sustain English rule.
Periodic expeditions led by minor figures could do little to revive the
king’s authority and the area under direct rule consequently contracted
to the ‘pale’ around Dublin. It was a confession of failure when the
government resorted to racial and cultural separation, even
persecution, by a series of enactments culminating in the statute of
86

Kilkenny (1366). The ‘lord of Ireland’ had a perfunctory lordship in the
later Middle Ages that was costly, lawless, hostile to English rule, and
open to exploitation by the Scots, the French, and even by Welsh rebels.

Anglo-French Relations and the Hundred Years War
The recognition of overlordship which English monarchs demanded of
the Welsh, Scots, and Irish was denied to the French king in Gascony,
where these same English kings, as dukes of Aquitaine, had been feudal
vassals of the Crown of France since 1204. Gascony lay at the heart of
Anglo-French relations both before and during the so-called Hundred
Years War (1337–1453): it replaced Normandy and Anjou as the main
bone of contention. At Edward I’s accession, this prosperous, wineproducing province was England’s only remaining French territory, and
trade in non-sweet wine which was complemented by the transport of
English cloth and corn by sea to Bordeaux and Bayonne: in 1306–7 the
duchy’s revenue was about £17,000 and well worth fighting for. Friction
with the French king over Gascony’s frontier and the rights of Gascons
was gradually subsumed in the larger issues of nationhood and
sovereignty posed by an assertive, self-conscious French state bent on
tightening its control over its provinces and vassals (including the
English duke of Aquitaine). For their part, Edward I and his successors
were reluctant to see French royal rights emphasized or given any
practical meaning in Gascony. The result was a series of incidents, peace
conferences, and ‘brushfire’ wars in which French armies penetrated
Gascony and the duchy was periodically confiscated, and English
expeditions – even a visit by Edward I himself (1286–9).
Relations between England and France might have continued to fester
in this fashion had it not been for two other factors. The English
government resented the Franco-Scottish alliance (from 1295) and was
angered by the refuge offered by the French (1334) to the Scottish King
David II after Edward III had invaded Scotland. Even more contentious
87

England at War, 1290–1390

the political link with England was reinforced by a flourishing export

were the consequences of the approaching extinction of the senior
male line of the French royal house of Capet. The deaths, in rapid
succession, of four French kings between 1314 and 1328, requiring the
swearing of homage for Gascony on each occasion, were irritating
enough, but the demise of the last Capet in 1328 raised the question of
the succession to the French throne itself. At that point, the new English
king, Edward III (1327–77), was in no position to stake his own claim
through his French mother, Isabella, but in 1337, when the Gascon
situation had deteriorated further, he did so. His action may have been
primarily tactical, to embarrass the new Valois monarch, Philip VI,
though for an English king to become king of France would have the
undeniable merit of resolving at a stroke the difficult Gascon issue: the
political stability and economic prosperity of Gascony would be assured.
Thus, when a French fleet was sighted off the Norman coast en route (so

Medieval Britain

the English believed) for Scotland in 1337, war began – and would last for
more than a century.
England’s war aims were neither constant nor consistently pursued.
Especially in the fourteenth century, its war diplomacy was primarily
dictated by a series of immediate problems, notably, of how to maintain
independent rule in Gascony and how to deter Scottish attacks across
the northern border in support of the French. Even after Edward III
claimed the French Crown in 1337, he was prepared to ransom John II,
the French king captured at the battle of Poitiers (1356), and to abandon
his claim in the treaty of Brétigny (1360) in return for practical
concessions. Nevertheless, dynastic ties, commercial and strategic
considerations, even differing attitudes to the Papacy, which was
installed at Avignon from 1308 to 1378, combined to extend the AngloFrench conflict to the Low Countries, to Castile and Portugal, as well as
to Scotland, Ireland, and even Wales. To begin with, the wars (for this
was a disjointed series of conflicts rather than one war) were fought by
sieges in northern France in 1338–40; then there was more intensive
campaigning by pincer movements through the French provinces of
Brittany, Gascony, and Normandy in 1341–7 (resulting in the English
88

victory at Crécy and the capture of Calais). This was followed by bold
marches or chevauchées by Edward III’s eldest son, Edward the Black
Prince, from Gascony in 1355–6 (culminating in the great victory at
Poitiers) and by the king himself in 1359 to Rheims, the traditional
coronation seat of French kings. The renewal of war in Castile (1367)
inaugurated a period of more modest and fitful campaigning in
Portugal, Flanders, and France itself, with both sides gradually
exhausting themselves.
The advantage in the war lay initially with England, the more united and
better organized of the two kingdoms. Its prosperity, based especially
on wool production, and its experience of warfare in Wales and
Scotland, were invaluable foundations for larger-scale operations on
mainland Europe. The existence of highly independent French provinces
1338–40 relied on the support of the cloth-manufacturing towns of
Flanders which, though subject to the French king, had vital commercial
links with England. In the 1340s a succession dispute in Brittany enabled
English forces to intervene there and even to garrison certain castles;
while Gascony, though far to the south, afforded direct access to central
France.
The wars within the British Isles gave the English government a unique
opportunity to develop novel methods of raising substantial forces.
Supplementing and gradually replacing the traditional feudal array, the
newer paid, contracted armies, recruited by indentured captains, were
smaller, better disciplined, and more dependable and flexible than the
loosely organized and ponderous French forces. English men-at-arms
and archers, proficient in the use of the longbow and employing
defensive tactics in battle, had a decisive advantage which brought
resounding victories against all the odds in the early decades of the war
(most notably at Crécy and Poitiers). The war at sea was a more minor
affair, with naval tactics showing little novelty or imagination. It was
usually beyond the capability of fourteenth-century commanders to
89

England at War, 1290–1390

dictated English strategy. Edward III’s campaigns in the Low Countries in

stage a naval engagement and the battle of Sluys (which the English
won in 1340) was incidental to Edward III’s expedition to Flanders. The
English never kept a fleet permanently in being, but the Valois, learning
the expertise of their Castilian allies, later constructed dockyards at
Rouen which in time gave them an edge at sea (witness their victory off
La Rochelle in 1372).
English investment in the French war was immense and unprecedented.
Expeditions were organized with impressive regularity and were
occasionally very large (over 10,000 men in 1346–7, for instance). The
financial outlay was prodigious and tolerated so long as the war was
successful; but as the margin of England’s military advantage narrowed
after 1369, so the government resorted to newer and more desperate
expedients, including poll taxes. Shipping for defence and expeditions

Medieval Britain

could not be supplied solely by the traditional obligation of the
southern Cinque Ports, and hundreds of merchant vessels (735 for the
siege of Calais in 1347, for example) were impressed and withdrawn
from normal commercial operations. Coastal defence against French
and Castilian raiders, who grew bolder after 1369, was organized by the
maritime shires of the south and east, supported by others inland – but
even this could not prevent the sacking of Winchelsea (1360), Rye (1377),
and other ports. The costs of war were indeed high. It is true that
conquered French estates were enjoyed by many a fortunate soldier,
and ransoms were profitable during the victorious years (King John II’s
ransom alone was fixed at £500,000). But the lives and occupations of
thousands of Englishmen, Welshmen, and Irishmen were disrupted by
war service; supplies of food, materials, and equipment were diverted to
operations that were entirely destructive; and the wool and wine trades
were severely hampered. What is remarkable is that England was able to
engage in these enterprises overseas for decades without serious
political or social strains at home, and at the same time to defend the
Scottish border, keep the Welsh calm, and avoid Irish uprisings. This
achievement owed much to the inspiration, example, and leadership of
Edward III and the Black Prince, both of whom embodied the chivalric
90

virtues vaunted by the nobility and admired by society at large. To Jean
Froissart, the Hainaulter who knew them both and kept a record of the
most inspiring chivalric deeds of his age, the king was ‘gallant and noble
[whose] like had not been seen since the days of King Arthur’. His son
appeared as ‘this most gallant man and chivalrous prince’ who, at his
death in 1376, a year before Edward III himself died, ‘was deeply
mourned for his noble qualities’. King Edward presided over a regime in
England that was less harsh than Edward I’s and far more capable than
Edward II’s.

Financing War, Political Reform, and Civil Strife
These wars were a catalyst of social change, constitutional
development, and political conflict in England which would otherwise
England in the fourteenth century experienced population and
economic fluctuations that increased tension and uncertainty. The
result was a series of crises which underlined how delicately balanced
was the relationship between the king and his subjects (especially his
magnates, who regarded themselves as representing the entire
‘community of the realm’) and how crucial to a personal monarchy was
the king himself. Able and determined – even far-sighted – Edward I and
his advisers may have been, but the king’s obstinate and autocratic
nature seriously strained relations with his influential subjects. Between
1290 and 1297, the propertied classes, the merchants, and especially the
clergy were subjected to extraordinarily heavy and novel demands for
taxes (four times as frequently as in the first half of Edward’s reign) for
the king’s enterprises in France and the British Isles. There was
resistance and a property tax of 1297 produced only a fraction (£35,000)
of what had been anticipated. Further, armies had been summoned by
the king for prolonged service outside the realm. Edward’s attempts to
silence resistance shocked the clergy and embittered the merchants.
The leading magnates, including Welsh marcher lords who resented
Edward’s invasion of their cherished franchises, reacted by resuming
91

have occurred more slowly. Moreover, along with the rest of Europe,

their time-honoured role as self-appointed spokesmen of the realm, and
they presented grievances to the king in 1297 and again in 1300. They
deployed Magna Carta as their banner against taxation without the
payers’ consent, and against oppressive and unprecedented exactions.
Yet, when Edward died in the arms of his attendants at Burgh-by-Sands
on 7 July 1307, just as he was about to cross the Solway Firth on his sixth
expedition to Scotland, the problems of wartime remained. He
bequeathed to his son and successor, Edward II (1307–27), an expensive
war in the north that was nowhere near a victorious conclusion, and
political unrest in England compounded by a dwindling of trust
between monarch and subject. These two preoccupations – political
stability and war – dominated public affairs during the following 200
years and had a profound effect on the kingdom’s social and political
cohesion and on its economic prosperity. The new king would need

Medieval Britain

exceptional tact if a further crisis of authority were to be avoided.
Tact was not Edward II’s outstanding quality. Starved of affection during
childhood, ignored by his father in adolescence, and confronted by
unsolved problems at his accession, Edward II sought advice, friendship,
even affection, from ambitious favourites such as Peter Gavaston and
Hugh Despenser who were unworthy of the king’s trust and whose
influence was resented by many magnates. These facts, together with
the determination of the magnates (led by Thomas, earl of Lancaster) to
extract from Edward concessions and reforms which Edward I had been
unwilling to confirm, turned the formidable difficulties of ruling a
kingdom that was facing setbacks in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and
France into a struggle for political reform and personal advancement.
An extended and more specific coronation oath (1308) bound the new
king more firmly to observe English law and custom, and ordinances
drawn up by the magnates in 1311 sought to limit the king’s freedom of
action; these ordinances were announced in Parliament in order to gain
wide support and approval. Edward II had all the stubbornness of his
father (though without his ability) and Gavaston’s murder (1312)
converted this quality into an unshakeable resolve not to be dominated
92

by his friend’s murderers. Meanwhile, the burdens of war and defence
on the king’s subjects were scarcely less heavy than they had been
during Edward I’s conquests, and this at a time of severe social distress
and poverty caused by a succession of disastrous harvests and livestock
diseases during 1315–22. Civil war (1321–2) and the king’s deposition
(1326–7) were the fateful outcome of the failure of king and governed to
co-operate to mutual benefit. Edward denounced the ordinances in
1322, again in a Parliament (at York), and after the defeat of his
opponents at Boroughbridge in 1322, he executed Lancaster. By 1326,
Edward’s deposition in favour of his namesake son and heir seemed the
only alternative to a mean, oppressive, and unsuccessful regime that
engendered civil strife. This awesome step, engineered with Queen
Isabella’s connivance, the acquiescence of Prince Edward, and with
substantial magnate and other support, demonstrated in a Parliament,
been deposed from his throne. In 1327, therefore, every effort was made
to conceal the unconcealable and justify the unjustifiable. Browbeaten,
tearful, and half-fainting, the wretched king was forced to assent to his
own abdication, and a meeting of Parliament was used to spread the
responsibility as widely as possible. Although the accession of Edward’s
son ensured that the hereditary principle remained intact, the
inviolability of anointed kingship had been breached.

Edward III’s Rule
Although only 14 in 1327, Edward III was soon a parent by 1330 and
proved far more capable than his father and more sensitive than he to
the attitudes and aspirations of his magnates – indeed, he shared them,
particularly in warfare and in accepting the chivalric obligations of an
aristocratic society. At the same time, the new king’s grandiose and
popular plans in France raised issues similar to those posed by
Edward I’s enterprises in the British Isles and Gascony. Should these
plans ultimately prove unsuccessful, the implications for England might

well be similar to those that had surfaced in Edward II’s reign. The
outbreak of prolonged war in 1337 meant increased taxation at a level
even higher than that of Edward I’s last years, and Edward III showed the
same ruthlessness towards merchants, bankers, and landowners as
Edward I had done. Moreover, the absences of the king on campaign, in
the thick of the fighting which he and his magnates relished, posed
serious questions for a sophisticated administration normally under the
personal direction of the king. Edward’s ordinances (issued at Waltonon-Thames, 1338) for the government of England from abroad caused
friction between the king and his advisers in northern France on the one
94

hand, and those councillors remaining in England on the other. Some
even feared that, if the war were successful, England might take
second place in King Edward’s mind to his realm of France. Thus, in
1339–43 another crisis arose in which magnates, merchants, and the
Commons in Parliament (now the forum in which royal demands for
taxation were made) protested to the king. Edward was induced to
act more circumspectly and considerately towards his magnates,
clergy, and subjects generally. The eventual reconciliation, and the
re-establishment of the trust in the king that had proved so elusive since
the 1290s, was possible because Edward III was a sensible and pragmatic
monarch, with a self-confidence that did not extend to arrogance. He
appointed ministers acceptable to his magnates, he pandered to the
self-importance of Parliament, and he developed a remarkable rapport
with his subjects which sustained his rule in England and his ambitions
in France for a quarter of a century. Further crisis was avoided, despite
England’s involvement in its most major war yet.

There was an enormous contrast with the situation in the 1370s and
1380s. For the generation of Englishmen alive then, the frustrations of
the resumed war in France (from 1369) and of debilitating skirmishes in
Ireland and on the Scottish border were unsettling; and renewed
taxation, after a decade when England had enjoyed the profits of war
and a respite from taxes, was resented. Raids on south-coast ports were
frequent, uncertain naval control of the Channel imperilled trade and
upset the merchants, and expensive chevauchées in France were
occasionally spectacular but rarely profitable. Yet the abrupt reversal of
English policy in 1375, involving a humiliating truce with France and
payments to the mistrusted pope, only served to affront and exasperate
Englishmen. Moreover, after the death (1369) of Queen Philippa, a
paragon among queens, Edward III lapsed gently into a senility that
sapped his strength and impaired his judgement. The Black Prince, too,

Medieval Britain

began to suffer from the effects of his wartime exertions; in fact, he
predeceased his father in June 1376. Yet the financial, manpower, and
other burdens on England’s population were not eased. Questions were
raised, especially by the Commons in Parliament, about the honesty as
well as the competence of the king’s advisers and officials.
Strengthened by a rising tide of anticlericalism in an age when the
reputation of the Papacy and the Church was severely tarnished, the
outcry had swept Edward III’s clerical ministers from power in 1371 and
others were accused of corruption, even treason. Another political crisis
had arisen. In the ‘Good Parliament’ of 1376, the longest and most
dramatic assembly yet held, the allegedly corrupt and incapable
ministers – even the old king’s influential mistress, Alice Perrers – were
accused by the Commons and tried before the Lords in a novel and
highly effective procedure (impeachment) which henceforward enabled
persons in high places to be held publicly to account for their public
actions.

96

The

o R har

The crisis entered a new phase when King Edward himself died in June
1377. He was succeeded by the Black Prince’s only surviving son and
heir, Richard II (1377–99), who was ten years of age. England was faced
with the prospect of only the second royal minority since 1066 and the
first since 1216. On the latter occasion there had followed a period of
political turbulence centring on the young Henry III; a similar situation
developed after 1377 and played its part in precipitating the Peasants’
Revolt (1381) in eastern and south-eastern England (see Chapter 6). A
series of poll taxes was imposed during 1377–80 to finance the war.
These taxes were at a rate higher than was usual and the tax of 1379 was
popularly known as ‘the evil subsidy’. They sparked off violence in East
Anglia against the tax-collectors and the justices who tried to force
widespread rebellion was the prolonged dislocation of unsuccessful war,
the impact of recurrent plagues, and the anticlerical temper of the
times. Hopes of remedy placed by the rebels in the young King Richard
proved to be vain, though he showed considerable courage in facing the
rebels in London during the summer of 1381.
Richard was still only 14, and the aristocratic rivalries in the ruling circle
continued, not least among the king’s uncles. This and the lack of
further military success in France damaged the reputation of the council
that governed England in Richard’s name and even affected the king’s
own standing in the eyes of his subjects. Richard, too, was proving a
self-willed monarch whose sense of insecurity led him to depend on
unworthy favourites reminiscent of Edward II’s confidants. As he grew
older, he naturally wanted to expand his entourage and his household
beyond what had been appropriate for a child. Among his friends and
associates were some who were new to the ranks of the aristocracy, and
all were generously patronized by the king at the expense of those
(including his uncle Gloucester) who did not attract Richard’s favour. In
1386 Parliament and a number of magnates attacked Richard’s closest
97

England at War, 1290–1390

compliance on the population. But what turned these irritations into

associates and even threatened the king himself. With all the
stubbornness of the Plantagenets, Richard refused to yield. This led to
further indictments or appeals of his advisers by five leading ‘appellant’
lords (the duke of Gloucester, and the earls of Warwick, Arundel,
Nottingham, and Derby, the king’s cousin), and a skirmish took place at
Radcot Bridge in December 1387 when the king’s closest friend, the earl
of Oxford, was routed. At the momentous ‘Merciless Parliament’ (1388),
the king was forced to submit to aristocratic correction which, if it had
been sustained, would have significantly altered the character of the
English monarchy. Once again, the pressures of war, the tensions of
personal rule, and the ambitions of England’s magnates had produced a
most serious political and constitutional crisis. The institution of
hereditary monarchy emerged largely unscathed after a century and
more of such crises, but criticism of the king’s advisers had reached a

Medieval Britain

new level of effectiveness and broader sections of opinion had exerted a
significant influence on events. These were the political and personal
dimensions of more deep-seated changes that were transforming
England’s social and economic life in the later Middle Ages.

98

Chapter 6
Wealth, Population, and
Social Change in the Later
Middle Ages
England’s wealth in the later Middle Ages was its land, the exploitation
of which engaged most Englishmen: growing corn, producing dairy
goods, and tending livestock. England’s most important industry,
textiles, was indirectly based on the land, producing the finest wool in
Europe from often very large sheep flocks: St Peter’s Abbey, Gloucester,
owned over 10,000 sheep by 1300, when the total number in England is
thought to have been in the region of 15 to 18 millions. The wealthiest
regions were the lowlands and gently rolling hill-country of the midland
and southern shires, with extensions into the borderland and southern
littoral of Wales. Other industries were less significant in creating wealth
and employing labour, but Cornish tin mining was internationally
famous and the tin was exported to the Continent. Lead, iron, and coal
mining was quite modest, though the coastal traffic in coal from the
Tyne Valley and the neighbourhood of Swansea reflected its growing
domestic and industrial use. As for financial and commercial services,
the economy gained little from what became, in modern times, one of
the nation’s prime sources of wealth. Few English merchants – the de la
Poles of Hull were an exception – could compete with the international
bankers of Italy, with their branches in London, despite the fact that
Edward I and Edward III were slow to honour their war debts to these
Italian companies. England’s mercantile marine was generally
outclassed, except in coastal waters, by foreign shipping; but the
Gascon wine-run and woollen shipments to the Low Countries did fall
99

increasingly into the hands of English merchants and into the holds of
English vessels. The thousand and more markets and fairs dotted about
the English and Welsh countryside – more numerous by 1350 than in the
past – served mainly their local communities within a radius of a score
or so miles. Most of these small towns and villages – Monmouth,
Worcester, and Stratford among them – were integrated with their rural
hinterland, whose well-to-do inhabitants frequently played a part in

ndow
nes,Psants,andrcns

town life, joining the guilds, buying or renting town residences, and
filling urban offices. A small number of towns, including some ports,
were larger and had broader commercial horizons: Shrewsbury’s traders
travelled regularly to London by the fifteenth century, and merchants
from the capital and Calais (after 1347) visited the Welsh borderland in
search of fine wool. Bristol, with its vital link with Bordeaux, was rapidly
becoming the entrepôt of late medieval Severnside; whilst York,

Medieval Britain

Coventry, and especially London were centres of international trade.

From this wealth sprang the prosperity of individuals, institutions, and
the Crown. The greatest landowners were the lay magnates (small in
number, like ‘skyscrapers on a plain’), bishops, monasteries, and other
religious institutions. In 1300 these still benefited handsomely from a
market boom created by the expanding population of the previous
century. Prices were buoyant and landed incomes substantial: after the
earl of Gloucester died at Bannockburn (1314), his estates were
estimated to be worth just over £6,000 a year, whilst those of Christ
Church Priory, Canterbury, produced in 1331 a gross annual income of
more than £2,540. Landowners therefore exploited their estates directly
and took a personal interest in their efficient management. They
insisted on their rights as far as possible, squeezing higher rents out of
tenants and carefully recording in manor courts the obligations
attached to holdings. Such landed wealth was the foundation of the
political, administrative, and social influence of the aristocracy, many of
whom had estates in several counties as well as Wales and Ireland:
100

Humphrey, earl of Hereford and Essex, for instance, inherited property
in Essex, Middlesex, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and
Buckinghamshire, and also in Brecon, Hay, Huntington, and Caldicot
in the Welsh march. Land was equally the basis of the gentry’s
fortunes, albeit on a more local, shire level, whilst it gave
ecclesiastical landowners an earthly authority that complemented
their hold on men’s minds and souls. This wealth could support
pretensions and ambitions on a more national stage, as in the case
of Thomas, earl of Lancaster (d. 1322), the richest earl in the England
of his day.

opportunities for economic advancement were limited by the tight
controls of the landowners. Prices were high – the price of wheat after
1270 was consistently higher than it had been earlier in the century –
and there was little cash to spare after food, clothing, and equipment
had been bought. Wages in an over-stocked labour market were low
and reduced the purchasing power of skilled and unskilled alike: a
carpenter earned 3d. a day (without food) and a labourer 1d. or 1–¹ d.
²
Grumbles, complaints, and spasms of violence were directed at
landowners and their officials, and rent strikes and refusals to perform
customary labour services were not uncommon.
The merchants of 1300, most notably the exporters of wool and
importers of wine, thrived in an expanding market from the Baltic to
Spain, Portugal, and, especially after the opening of the sea-route from
the Mediterranean, to northern Italy. During 1304–11 wool exports
averaged annually 39,500 sacks (each containing at least 250 fleeces)
and only 30–40 per cent of these cargoes was shipped by foreigners.
The rising antipathy towards alien merchants in English trade reflects
the self-confidence and assertiveness of native (or denizen) merchants.
Edward I legislated (1280s) in their interest, notably to facilitate the
recovery of debts at law, which was essential to the expansion of trade.
But when war came, merchants were among the first to resist heavy

The king was the largest landowner of all, even before Edward I acquired
a principality in Wales and the estates of the house of Lancaster merged
with the Crown’s in 1399. The growth of national taxation under Edward
I and his successors enabled the Crown to tap the wealth of private
landowners and merchants, too. Not even the peasantry escaped, as
the Husbandman’, in Edward I’s reign. Then, in 1327, all who had goods
worth at least 10s. a year were required to pay 1s. 8d. in tax, and
doubtless the less well-off had the burden passed on to them indirectly.
The preoccupation with war made the king heavily dependent on the
wealth and forbearance of his subjects. If that wealth ceased to grow, or
if the prosperity of individuals and institutions were punctured, then the
king’s extraordinary commitments might eventually be beyond his
means and his subjects’ tolerance wear dangerously thin.
By the mid-fourteenth century the prosperous period of ‘high farming’
was almost over. Prices were falling, making cultivation for a market less
profitable. Wages were rising, more so for agricultural labourers than
for craftsmen, and there was no advantage in employing women, who
were paid the same as men – indeed, in bear-baiting they were paid
more! The principal reason why large-scale farming was losing some of
its attraction was that the population boom came to an end and went,
full throttle, into reverse. As the pool of available labour shrank, wages
rose; as the population declined so did the demand for food and
supplies, and prices followed suit.

was well appreciated by those who sang the popular lament, ‘Song of

Population, Poverty, and Plague
England’s population reached its peak, perhaps over 4 millions, about
the end of the thirteenth century. At that time, there was insufficient
cultivable land to ensure that all peasant families had an adequate
livelihood. A high population coupled with low living standards
inevitably meant poverty, famine, and disease, and a mortality that
crept upwards and brought the demographic boom to a halt. The plight
of those living at or below the poverty-line was made worse by a series
of natural disasters related to over-exploitation of the land and
exceptionally bad weather in the opening decades of the fourteenth

storage facilities: there was less to eat and no cash to buy what now cost
much more. The harvests of the years 1315, 1316, 1320, and 1321 were
exceptionally bad; cattle and sheep murrains were especially prevalent
in 1319 and 1321, and on the estates of Ramsey Abbey (Cambs.) recovery
took 20 years; and in 1324–6 parts of England had severe floods which
drowned thousands of sheep in Kent. Famine and disease spread, and
on Halesowen Manor (Worcs.) 15 per cent of males died in 1315–17.
Agricultural dislocation was widespread, grain prices soared (from
5s. 7–14 d. to 26s. 8d. per quarter in Halesowen during 1315–16), and wool
exports collapsed. However, it was a temporary calamity and England
in particular had been starkly demonstrated.
Longer lasting and more profound were the consequences of plague.
The first attack, known since the late sixteenth century as the Black
Death but to contemporaries as ‘the great mortality’, occurred in
southern England in 1348; by the end of 1349 it had spread north to
central Scotland. Geoffrey le Baker, a contemporary Oxfordshire cleric,
described its progress from the ports, where it arrived in rat-infested
ships, and men’s helplessness in diagnosing its cause and dealing
with its effects.
And at first it carried off almost all the inhabitants of the seaports in
Dorset, and then those living inland and from there it raged so
dreadfully through Devon and Somerset as far as Bristol and then men
of Gloucester refused those of Bristol entrance to their country,
everyone thinking that the breath of those who lived amongst people
who died of plague was infectious. But at last it attacked Gloucester,
yea and Oxford and London, and finally the whole of England so
violently that scarcely one in ten of either sex was left alive. As the
graveyards did not suffice, fields were chosen for the burial of the
dead . . . A countless number of common people and a host of monks
and nuns and clerics as well, known to God alone, passed away. It was

gradually recovered during the 1320s; but the vulnerability of the poor

pestilence, which began at Bristol on [15 August] and in London about
[29 September], raged for a whole year in England so terribly that it
cleared many country villages entirely of every human being. While this
great calamity was devastating England, the Scots rejoicing thought
that they would obtain all they wished against the English . . . But
sorrow following on the heels of joy, the sword of the anger of God
departing from the English drove the Scots to frenzy . . . In the following
year it ravaged the Welsh as well as the English; and at last, setting sail,
so to speak, for Ireland, it laid low the English living there in great
numbers, but scarcely touched at all the pure Irish who lived amongst
the mountains and on higher ground, until the year of Christ 1357,
when it unexpectedly and terribly destroyed them also everywhere.

Economic Effects of the Black Death
At a stroke, the Black Death reduced England’s population by about a
third. By 1350, Newcastle upon Tyne was in desperate financial straits
‘on account of the deadly pestilence as by various other adversities in
these times of war’, and Carlisle was ‘wasted and more than usually
depressed as well by the mortal pestilence lately prevalent in those
parts as by frequent attacks’ (by the Scots). Seaford (Sussex) was
reported even in 1356 as ‘so desolated by plague and the chances of war
that men living there are so few and poor that they cannot pay their
taxes or defend the town’. Tusmore (Oxon.) was another victim of the
plague: by 1358 permission was given to turn its fields into a park
because every villein was dead and the village no longer had any
taxpayers. Nevertheless, the Black Death’s effects were not immediately
or permanently catastrophic. The behaviour of a Welshman living in
Ruthin was not uncommon: he ‘left his land during the pestilence on
account of poverty’, but by 1354 he had returned ‘and was admitted by
the lord’s favour to hold the same land by the service due from the
same’. In any case, in a well-populated country, dead tenants could be
replaced and landowners’ incomes over the next 20 years were cut by
no more than 10 per cent. It was the recurrence of plague over the
106

following century – particularly the attacks of 1360–2, 1369, and 1375 –
which had lasting effects, even if these outbreaks were more local
and urban. The population steadily declined to about two and a half
millions – or even less – by the mid-fifteenth century.
For those who survived an ugly death, life may not have been as
wretched in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as it
undoubtedly was before. For many peasants, this became an age of
opportunity, ambition, and affluence: Chaucer was able to portray his
pilgrims in the Canterbury Tales with good-humoured optimism, not in
an atmosphere of gloom and despondency. The peasant in a smaller
labour market was often able to shake off the disabilities of centuries,
force rents down, and insist on a better wage for his hire; and with the

12. A ‘lost village’ among 1,300 and more in the Midlands and eastern
England. Middle Ditchford (Glos.) was probably abandoned in the midfifteenth century because of declining population and the conversion of
its streets, lanes, and open fields (still well marked, with
ridge-and-furrow cultivation in foreground) to pastoral farming

collapse in prices, his standard of living rose. The more successful and
ambitious peasants leased new property, invested spare cash by lending
to their fellows and, especially in the south and east, built substantial
stone houses for the first time in peasant history.
Landowners, on the other hand, were facing severe difficulties. Market
production in wheat, wool, and other commodities was less profitable,
the cultivated area of England contracted, and agricultural investment
was curtailed. Wages and other costs climbed and it seemed advisable
to abandon ‘high farming’ techniques in favour of leasing plots to
enterprising peasants. Entire communities were deserted – the ‘lost
villages’ of England – and many of these were abandoned as a result of
the twin afflictions of demographic crisis and prolonged war: among
the English regions with the highest number of ‘lost villages’ are

Medieval Britain

Northumberland, close to the Scottish border, and the Isle of Wight, the
goal of enemy marauders. Only in the last decades of the fifteenth
century – from the 1460s in East Anglia – did England’s population begin
to rise at all significantly, and it is likely that the level of 1300 was not
reached again until the seventeenth century.
England’s economy had contracted markedly in the late fourteenth
century, but it was not universally depressed. After men came to terms
with the psychological shock of the plague visitations, society adjusted
remarkably well, though not without turmoil. Landowners had the most
painful adjustment to make and they reacted in several ways, not all of
which were calculated to preserve domestic peace. Some, including the
more conservatively minded ecclesiastical landlords such as the abbot
of St Albans, resorted to high-handed measures, even to oppression and
extortion, to preserve their hold on their remaining tenants. Some
exploited their estates ruthlessly in order to conserve their incomes, and
the harsh attitudes of magnate families such as the Mortimers, with
extensive estates in Wales, may have helped cause the Glyndŵr
rebellion (1400). Others, such as the dukes of Buckingham later in the
fifteenth century, adopted more efficient methods of management to
108

improve the profitability of their estates. Yet others saw the enclosure
of fields and commons for pasture and cultivation as less costly and an
alternative means of buttressing unsteady rent-rolls; enclosure
gathered speed especially in the north and west in the later fifteenth
century. Large and small, the landowners as a group acted ‘to curb the
malice of servants, who were idle, and not willing to serve after the
pestilence, without excessive wages’. Edward III’s ordinance (1349) to
restore pre-plague wage levels and discourage mobility among an
emancipated labour force was quickly turned into a parliamentary
statute (1351). Moreover, the well-placed magnate or gentleman had
the form of grants of land, money, and office (as the Beaufort relatives
of King Henry VI well knew); family inheritance, which enabled Richard,
duke of York (d. 1460) to become the richest magnate of his age; and
fortunate marriage with a well-endowed heiress or a wealthy widow.
Others prospered in the king’s service, not least in war. Henry V’s
spectacular victories enabled the capture of ransomable prisoners and
the acquisition of estates in northern France, and as late as 1448 the
duke of Buckingham was expecting more than £530 a year from the
French county of Perche. Some invested the profits of service and war in
the mid-fifteenth century in the grandest manner, building imposing
and elegant castles: witness Sir John Fastolf’s at Caister (Norfolk), or the
Herberts’ huge fortress-palace at Raglan (Gwent), or Sir Ralph Botiller’s
castle at Sudeley (Gloucestershire). Such means and resources as these
facilitated the emergence of aristocratic lines that were every bit as
powerful as those of earlier centuries and often with entrenched
regional positions like those of the Nevilles and Percies in the north and
the Staffords and Mortimers in the west.
Similar adjustments were taking place in English towns and trade. Woolgrowing remained the main pastoral occupation, but the pattern of its
industry was transformed during the fourteenth century. Partly as a
result of the war and its disruption of Flemish industry, and partly as a
result of changes in English taste and demand, cloth manufacture

supplementary sources of wealth available to him: royal patronage in

absorbed growing quantities of wool previously exported; a number of
the wool ports, such as Boston and Lynn in eastern England, began to
decline. Leading cloth-manufacturing centres such as Stamford and
Lincoln were overtaken by a host of newer ones sited in villages and
towns near fast-flowing streams and rivers that ran the fulling mills.
York found itself upstaged by Leeds, Halifax, and Bradford; further
south, East Anglia, the west country, and even Wales developed a
flourishing cloth industry, with Bristol as the main outlet in the west.
London was in a class of its own: the only medieval English town with a
population probably in excess of 50,000 in the late fourteenth century.
It was an entrepôt for the kingdom, a terminal of the Baltic, North Sea,

Psts’volt

and Mediterranean trades; it attracted immigrants from the home
counties and East Anglia, and especially from the East Midlands; and its
suburbs were creeping up-river towards Westminster. No less than in

Medieval Britain

the countryside, these changes unsettled life in a number of towns,
whose burgess oligarchies strove to maintain their control in a changing
world. The landowners of England thus strove to counter the economic
crisis, but it was often at the price of straining relations with an
increasingly assertive peasantry and established urban communities.

The ea an

Re

The cumulative effect of economic, social, political, and military strains
in fourteenth-century England is seen most graphically in the Peasants’
Revolt (1381). It was exceptional in its intensity, length, and broad
appeal, but not in its fundamental character, which was revealed in
other conspiracies and insurrections in the years that followed.
Widespread violence was sparked off in 1381 by yet another poll tax, this
one at 1s. a head, three times the rate of 1377 and 1379. People
responded with evasion, violence towards the collectors and the
justices who investigated, and, ultimately, in June 1381, with rebellion.
Agricultural workers from eastern and south-eastern England were
joined by townsmen and Londoners; the grain and wool-growing
countryside of East Anglia had felt the full impact of the contraction and
110

dislocation of the economy and the social contradictions of an
increasingly outmoded feudal society. Moreover, the rebels were
disillusioned by the political mismanagement of the 1370s and the
recent dismal record in France, and they feared enemy raids on the
coast. Although heretics played no major role in the rebellion, radical
criticism of the doctrines and organization of the English Church
predisposed many to denounce an establishment that seemed to be
failing in its duty.
Pressure on the government and an appeal to the new king (‘With King
held out the best hope for remedy of grievances, and the populace of
London offered a pool of potential sympathizers. The rebels accordingly
converged on London from Essex and Kent (where Wat Tyler and a
clerical demagogue, John Ball, emerged as leaders). They threw prisons

serfdom and revolutionized landholding in Church and State. But the
rebellion was poorly planned and organized and more in the nature of a
spontaneous outburst of frustration. By 15 June the rebels had dispersed

Still at War, 1390–1490

In 1389, when Richard II was 22 years old, he declared: ‘I am of full age to
govern my house, and my household, and also my realm. For it seems
unjust to me that the condition which I am now in should be worse than
the condition of the least of my kingdom.’ The events of 1386–8, when
the appellant lords sought to dictate the choice of the king’s friends and
ministers and to regulate his political actions, had poisoned relations
between the unforgiving king and his critics. Among these were some
of the most powerful magnates in the realm, with estates in central and
southern England that together rivalled in size the remoter franchises of
the Crown in Wales, Cheshire, and Cornwall. After 1389, however,
Richard cautiously asserted himself as king of England, and with
intelligence and courage he tried to deal with the consequences of his
predecessors’ ambitions and policies during the previous century. In a
period of comparative political calm, Richard carefully constructed a
party of loyalists, based on his household and the distant franchises,
particularly Cheshire and North Wales. The earl of Arundel’s forfeited
lordships gave him an enhanced royal power in the Welsh march, where
aristocratic lordships were at their most independent. The large and
expensive expedition to Ireland in 1394–5, the first by an English king
since 1210, was successful in revitalizing English rule and bringing Gaelic
and Anglo-Irish lords to heel by a skilful mixture of firmness and
conciliation; Richard may even have had the final and long-delayed
conquest of the island in mind. This venture certainly strengthened his
113

power in yet another royal lordship and demonstrated what his
household organization and resources could achieve, albeit temporarily.
Towards Scotland, following the English defeat at Otterburn (1388),
Richard took the more traditional paths of encouraging dissident
Scottish magnates and planning military campaigns; but in the 1390s he
came to appreciate the benefits of peace. A treaty with France in 1396
and Richard’s marriage to Isabella of Valois halted an even more
debilitating war; if the cessation of hostilities had run its intended
course (to 1426), it would have provided the longest period of peace in
the entire Hundred Years War. At home, the king was able to
concentrate on restoring royal government, which had been so seriously
damaged by the personal and political weaknesses of the 1370s and
1380s. To this end, ceremony and visual symbolism were creatively used

Medieval Britain

as royal propaganda.
Richard was imaginative, shrewd, and masterful. Other of his attributes
were less desirable in a king. His upbringing and adolescent experiences
bred an insecurity that led to overconfidence, a lack of proportion, and
arbitrariness. Wilfully extravagant towards his friends, he could be
capricious, secretive, and harsh towards his enemies, and in 1397–8 he
exiled the earl of Warwick, executed Arundel, murdered Gloucester, and
then exiled Derby and Nottingham too. Ruthlessly deploying the
monarch’s personal powers (‘He threw down whomsoever violated the
Royal Prerogative’ was part of the inscription he composed for his own
tomb), Richard’s last two years have been justly termed tyrannous. The
pope was induced to threaten excommunication against anyone who
‘attempts anything prejudicial against the right of our Crown, our
regality or our liberty, or maliciously defames our person’, while
Richard’s treaty with France promised French aid against his own
subjects should the need arise. His second visit to Ireland in May 1399
presented Henry Bolingbroke, earl of Derby and now duke of Hereford
and Lancaster, with the opportunity to return to England, retrieve his
position, and recover the duchy of Lancaster estates of his father that
had recently been seized by Richard. The king’s methods had outrun
114

English law and custom – and the tolerance of his greater subjects. But
his deposition later in the year (29 September) ended the most coherent
attempt yet to lift the burden of war from Englishmen’s shoulders.

England and its Neighbours in the Fifteenth Century
The dethronement of Richard II was a momentous decision. Despite the
precedent of 1327, the situation in 1399 was different in one important
respect. It was the first time since Richard the Lionheart’s death that an
English king had ended his reign without leaving a son and heir, and the
realm now faced the possibility of a disputed succession. Custom since
1216 had vested the succession in the senior male line, even though that
might mean a child-king (as in the case of Henry III and Richard II
himself). But there was as yet no acknowledged rule of succession

oupd’éta

should the senior male line fail. In 1399 the choice by blood lay between
from Edward III’s second son, Lionel, and Henry Bolingbroke, the
33-year-old son of King Edward’s third son, John. Bolingbroke seized
the Crown after being assured of support from the Percy family whom
Richard had alienated. But in the extraordinary circumstances created
by Richard II’s dethronement and imprisonment, neither March nor
Bolingbroke had obviously the stronger claim. No amount of distortion,
concealment, and argument on Bolingbroke’s part could disguise what
was a c

. Hence, as in the twelfth century, an element of

dynastic instability was injected into English politics which contributed
to domestic turmoil, and encouraged foreign intrigue and intervention
in the following century.

England, meanwhile, could not escape the consequences of its earlier
attempted subjugation of the ‘Celtic’ peoples in the British Isles. After
the failure of Richard II’s imaginative policies, a more stable relationship
was needed to ensure security for the realm now that further conquest
and colonization were patently beyond its resources. In practice, English
kings abandoned all serious intention of implementing their claims to

Still at War, 1390–1490

the seven-year-old earl of March, descended through his grandmother

overlordship in Scotland and much of Ireland. In the fifteenth century,
they were on the defensive against the Scots, partly because of the
renewal of war in France and partly because of England’s internal
difficulties in Henry IV’s reign (1399–1413) and after 1450; the Scots even
sent substantial reinforcements to aid the French in 1419. For a brief
time (1406–24), the captivity in England of King James I deterred major
hostilities across the border, but thereafter the Scots became more
daring, hoping to recover Roxburgh Castle and also Berwick, which they
achieved in 1460–1. Raids, sea skirmishes, and piracy, together with
ineffective truces, combined to produce a state of interminable ‘cold
war’. Only after the end of the Hundred Years War (1453) and the
establishment of the Yorkist regime in England (1461) was there a really
purposeful search for a more stable relationship. An Anglo-Scottish
treaty was sealed in 1475, and a ‘perpetual peace’ in 1502, despite

Medieval Britain

misgivings in France and the occasional English campaign in Scotland,
such as Richard, duke of Gloucester’s seizure of Berwick in 1482. This
marked a significant shift in relations between the two countries,
although border society continued to thrive on raids and disorder was a
way of life.
The equilibrium reached in relations with Ireland was less satisfactory
for England than for the Gaelic population and the Anglo-Irish nobility.
Richard II’s bold assertion of royal authority had failed, and was not
repeated in the Middle Ages. The king’s lordship of Ireland, though
heavily subsidized from England, was consistently weak: the Gaels
enjoyed independence and comparative prosperity, and the Anglo-Irish
cherished their own power and came to terms with their Gaelic
counterparts. The English government’s main concern was security
(‘Ireland is a buttress and a post under England’, declared a
contemporary in the 1430s), and only when this was threatened during
the Welsh rebellion (1400–9) and in the 1450s was more interest shown
in Irish affairs. Internal political fragmentation and separation from
England were the result. The greater Anglo-Irish magnates were the
only source of power on which the government could rely to preserve
116

some semblance of its authority: most Englishmen were reluctant even
to go to Ireland, effective rule from Dublin was impossible, and the
resources for conquest simply did not exist. The real rulers of fifteenthcentury Ireland were magnates such as the earls of Ormond and Kildare;
even if the government had wanted to dislodge them, it could not. An
equilibrium in Anglo-Irish relations was reached, but at the cost of
surrendering effective English control.
In Wales, the heritage of complete conquest brought its own problems,
notably a resentment which, in the unsettled economic climate of the
late fourteenth century, was focused on the Anglicized boroughs and
directed against officials in Church and State who were mostly from the
English border shires or even further afield. This resentment was
channelled into rebellion by Owain Glyndŵr from 1400, and after this
unpleasant experience most Englishmen regarded Wales with suspicion

Beware of Wales, Christ Jesus must us keep,
That it make not our child’s child to weep,
Nor us also, if so it go this way
By unwariness; since that many a day
Men have been afraid of there rebellion . . . .

Wales, then, posed a security problem and one much closer to hand. It
not only provided a landfall for enemies from overseas (as at the height
of Glyndŵr’s rebellion and repeatedly during the Wars of the Roses), but
was a land marred by misgovernment and disorder. Henry V showed
firmness tempered by conciliation in dealing with Welshmen
immediately after the rebellion collapsed, and marcher lords were
ordered to attend to their lordships. But later on, neither the Crown nor
the marcher lords were capable of sustaining vigorous rule, and the
Welsh squirearchy, brothers-in-arms of the English gentry, showed less
and less responsibility. Yet these Welsh squires were needed by the
Crown and the marcher lords to govern Wales, for the Crown became
117

Still at War, 1390–1490

and fear. One contemporary urged:

immersed in civil war and by the fifteenth century the smaller number
of lords were deterred from living in their lordships by falling incomes
and Welsh hostility. The country, which by 1449 ‘daily abundeth and
increaseth in misgovernance’, consequently presented a problem of
order – and therefore of security – for much of the century. Successive
English regimes, from Henry VI to Henry VII, sought to keep the Welsh
peaceful, improve the quality of government, and control the local
squirearchy, for only then could the threat to the border shires and to
the stability of the kingdom be lifted. In the first half of the century, the
aim was to tighten up the existing machinery of law enforcement,
relying on royal officers and marcher lords to fulfil their responsibilities.
More radical and constructive solutions were eventually adopted,
especially by Edward IV, who settled his son, the Prince of Wales, at
Ludlow in the 1470s with a supervisory power in the principality of

Medieval Britain

Wales, the marcher lordships, and the English border shires. This was a
bold act of devolution that gave future princes responsibility
throughout Wales.
The territorial power of the English magnates (the barons, viscounts,
earls, marquesses, and dukes in ascending order of status) was crucial to
the peace of the realm and the success of royal government. They
became in the fifteenth century a strictly defined and hereditary social
group that was practically synonymous with the parliamentary peerage
sitting in the House of Lords. The monarch could create peers (as Henry
VI and Edward IV readily did) and could elevate existing ones to higher
rank, while the king’s patronage was essential to maintain magnate
wealth and influence. Monarchs who did not appreciate this risked
serious conflict with their magnates (as Richard II and Richard III
discovered to their cost). Though few in number – at most 60 families,
and perhaps half that figure after decades of civil war – they were vital
not only because of the independent lordships which some of them held
in the Welsh march and the dominance of the Nevilles and Percies in the
north but also because of their social and political control of the English
provinces. They were a more effective buttress of the Crown than its
118

own bureaucracy or civil service. This was especially true in a century
when three dynasties seized the Crown by force and had formidable
military commitments at home and overseas to which the magnates
made a notable contribution. The humiliation of defeat in France and
the loss of English territories there was directly felt by the magnates and
was something which Edward IV and Henry VII later strove to avoid.
These magnates had an identity of interest with the gentry of England –
the 6,000 to 9,000 gentlemen, esquires, and knights who sought the
‘good lordship’ of the magnates and provided ‘faithful service’ in return.
The magnates gave fees, land, and offices, and the gentry advice,
support, and military aid: in 1454 the duke of Buckingham gave his
badge to 2,000 of his retainers. Towns and townsmen were part of this
relationship of mutual interest and service which historians have
unflatteringly dubbed ‘bastard feudalism’. The behaviour of the
Parliament – the Lords and Commons – was another aspect of this
interlocking relationship.
The co-operation of the magnates and their clients was especially
vital to the usurping dynasties of the fifteenth century. The
Lancastrians were well placed because Henry IV inherited the network
of interests created by his father, John of Gaunt. At £12,000 a year,
Gaunt was the richest magnate in late medieval England and his
extensive estates and patronage were now at the disposal of his
descendants as kings of England (1399–1461). The Yorkists (1461–85),
as heirs of the earl of March, the alternative candidate in 1399, were
less well endowed, except in the Welsh march. Their failure to enlist
the support of most magnates was a serious weakness in a dynasty
which survived for just 24 years. Henry VII, who inherited the estates,
territorial influence, and patronage not only of Lancaster and York,
but also of Neville, Beaufort, and other casualties of civil war,
established the firmest control of all over the English magnates
and gentry.

magnates and the gentry and townsmen in two distinct Houses of

Rebellion in England and Wales
The first usurper, Henry IV, had the advantage of displacing a king who
had alienated many and whose noble sympathizers were discredited.
Henry’s drive, perseverance, and powers of conciliation – not to say his
generosity – and his Lancastrian connections enabled him to overcome
the most daunting combination of enemies that any English king had
faced. Richard II’s die-hard supporters were foiled in their plot to
assassinate Henry and his sons at Windsor Castle, and these rebels were
apprehended and killed at Cirencester (December 1399). The danger
from such ‘Ricardians’ led to Richard’s own mysterious death in
Pontefract Castle soon afterwards. The Percy earls of Northumberland
and Worcester, virtual kingmakers in 1399, were so disenchanted by
1403 with the king’s aim to win over all shades of opinion that they

Medieval Britain

plotted several risings. Northumberland’s son Hotspur, while marching
to join the Welsh rebels, was defeated and killed near Shrewsbury. A
Percy alliance with Archbishop Scrope of York raised the north of
England, but Henry again acted quickly and in 1405 executed the
prelate. Northumberland’s last strike, with Scottish aid, collapsed at
Bramham Moor, where the earl was slain (1408).
The Welsh rebellion had deeper roots in the soil of a colonial society.
The distress experienced by a plague-ridden people, oppression by alien
landowners bent on maintaining their incomes, a tendency to close the
doors to opportunity against aspiring Welshmen, even resentment at
Richard II’s removal, combined to throw the country into revolt (1400).
The variety of rebel motives and the divisions in Welsh society meant
that this was no purely national, patriotic rising. Yet it was the most
serious threat that Henry IV had to face and the most expensive to
suppress. From his estates in north-east Wales, Owain Glyndŵr laid
waste castles and Anglicized towns. He and his guerrilla forces exploited
the mountainous terrain to harass and exhaust the enemy and then
disappear ‘among rocks and caves’. Their success can be measured by
the length of the rebellion, the absence of decisive battles, and the
120

fruitlessness of royal expeditions. Glyndŵr could occasionally muster
8,000 men, and he sought aid from France (1403) and fellow ‘Celts’ in

h
ées
u
eva

Scotland and Ireland (1401). In ‘parliaments’ in 1404 and 1405, he

produced grand schemes for an independent Wales, with its own

ecclesiastical organization and universities (aims which were not finally

realized for another four centuries), and his alliance with the Percies was
intended as a prelude to the dismemberment of Henry IV’s realm.

The English, led by the king and his eldest son, Prince Henry, conducted
several Welsh campaigns (1400–5), whose strategy was akin to that
adopted in France – with pincer movements, destructive ch

c

,

and co-ordinated supply by land and sea. The burden fell most heavily

and frequently on the border shires and the West Midlands, which time

and again were ordered to array men for service in Wales. These armies
were substantial ones – 4,000 strong – especially when one recalls that
service in Wales was nothing like as popular as service in the lusher
fields of France; there was difficulty in raising enough cash to pay the
soldiers and garrisons, and in September 1403 Henry IV was told that

‘you will not find a single gentleman who will stop in your said country’.
Generally secure in the north and west, Owain had his own problems
of manpower, supply, and money, and the failure of his march on
Worcester in 1405 caused his star to wane. He lost his Scottish ally when
James I fell into English hands (1406), and an Anglo-French truce was
arranged in 1407. By 1408, the greatest dangers for Henry IV had passed:
by perseverance, decisiveness, and a readiness to live in the saddle, as
he pursued his enemies across England and Wales and to Edinburgh
beyond, Henry overcame them all. By conciliation, he obtained
Parliament’s support without surrendering any significant part of his
royal powers, and his four sons, Henry, Thomas, John, and Humphrey,
were a maturing asset. Only two further threats to the dynasty occurred
after his death in 1413. When the anticlericalism of certain courtiers
turned to heresy the following year, Henry V did not hesitate to
121

Still at War, 1390–1490

the armies sent to France rarely exceeded 5,000–6,000 men. But

condemn even his old friend, Sir John Oldcastle. The last revolt before
1450 to be justified by the usurpation of 1399 – that in favour of the earl
of March in 1415 – was suppressed just before King Hal left for France.
Henry IV could claim considerable success in establishing his dynasty on
firm foundations. International acceptance was won by alliances in
Germany, Scandinavia, Brittany, and Burgundian Flanders.

Henry V and the War with France
Henry V inherited a realm that was sufficiently peaceful, loyal, and
united for him to campaign extensively in France (from 1415) and to
spend half of the next seven years abroad. With experience of war and
government as Prince of Wales, he proved a capable, fearless, and
authoritarian monarch who abandoned the careful ways of his father.

Medieval Britain

Even during his absences in France, his kingship was firm and energetic,
enabling him to wage a war that was as much a popular enterprise as
Edward III’s early campaigns had been. His reign was the climax of
Lancastrian England.
Henry prepared for war by conciliating surviving Ricardians and
renewing foreign alliances. The condition of France, with an insane king
and quarrelsome nobles, encouraged his dreams of conquest. By 1415 he
felt able to demand full sovereignty over territories beyond Edward III’s
vision and even to revive Edward’s claim to the French Crown. Henry’s
ambitions coincided with his subjects’ expectations. Large armies were
raised under the leadership of enthusiastic magnates and knights; the
realm voted taxation frequently and on a generous scale, and the king
was able to explain his aims publicly so as to attract support. He even
built a navy to dominate the Channel. This enthusiasm hardly faded at
all before his death, though the parliamentary Commons expressed
(1420) the same unease about the consequences for England of a final
conquest of France as had their forebears to Edward III.
Henry V’s strategy was Edward’s – to ally with French nobles to exploit
122

Map 4. English military enterprises in Western Europe in the later Middle
Ages

their divisions and press his own dynastic claim. Throughout the war,
Burgundy’s support was essential to English success. Quite soon,
however, the invader’s aims broadened into conquest and colonization
on an unprecedented scale. The 1415 expedition tested the water and
the victory at Agincourt strikingly vindicated traditional English tactics.
In 1417–20, therefore, Henry set about conquering Normandy which,
along with adjacent provinces, was the main theatre of war during and
after Henry’s reign. The treaty of Troyes (1420) with Charles VI made
him regent of France and heir to the Valois throne in place of the
Dauphin. This extraordinary treaty dictated Anglo-French relations for
more than a generation. Though Henry V never became king of France
(he predeceased Charles VI in 1422), his baby son, Henry VI of England
and, to the Anglophiles, Henry II of France, inherited the dual monarchy.

Medieval Britain

It would require unremitting effort to maintain it.
Henry V and John, duke of Bedford, his brother and successor as military
commander in France, pushed the Norman frontier east and south
during 1417–29 and they defeated the French successively at Agincourt
(1415), Cravant (1423), and Verneuil (1424). This was the high point of
English power in France. Under Bedford, a ‘constructive balance of
firmness and conciliation’ sought to make both the conquered lands
and further campaigns (southwards in Anjou and Maine) pay for
themselves. But the French resurgence inspired by Joan of Arc and the
coronation of Charles VII at Rheims (1429) foiled this plan, and the
English advance was halted after the defeat at Patay. Thereafter, the
Normans grew restless under their foreign governors, England’s Breton
and Burgundian allies began to waver, and the English Parliament had to
find yet more cash for the war in northern France where garrison and
field armies were an increasingly heavy burden. The English were in a
military as well as a financial trap – and without the genius of Henry V to
direct them.

124

Henry VI and the Search for Peace
During the 1430s the search for peace became more urgent, particularly
in England. The Congress of Arras (1435) and discussions at Gravelines
(1439) were unproductive, largely because English opinion remained
divided as to the desirability of peace and the wisdom of significant
concessions. But the recovery in Charles VII’s fortunes, the mounting
cost of English expeditions to defend Lancastrian France, Bedford’s
death in 1435, and especially the defection of Burgundy were decisive
factors. The government freed the duke of Orléans (a captive in England
since Agincourt) to promote peace among his fellow French princes
(1440), though he did not have much success. In 1445 Henry VI married
the French queen’s niece, Margaret of Anjou, but even that only
produced a truce, and a proposed meeting of kings never took place.
Eventually, Henry VI promised to surrender hard-won territory in the
to win the support of his subjects for this move – especially those
magnates and gentry who had lands in France and had borne the brunt
of the fighting – led to the exasperated French attacking Normandy in
1449. Their onslaught, supported by artillery, was so spectacularly
successful that the English were defeated at Rouen and Formigny, and
quickly cleared from the duchy by the end of August 1450: ‘. . . never
had so great a country been conquered in so short a space of time, with
such small loss to the populace and soldiery, and with so little killing of
people or destruction and damage to the countryside’, reported a
French chronicler.
Gascony, which had seen few major engagements under Henry V and
Henry VI, was invaded by the triumphant French armies, and after their
victory at Castillon on 17 July 1453, the English territories in the southwest were entirely lost. This was the most shattering blow of all:
Gascony had been English since the twelfth century, and the longestablished wine and cloth trades with south-west France were seriously
disrupted. Of Henry V’s ‘empire’, only Calais now remained. The

defeated and disillusioned soldiers who returned to England regarded
the discredited Lancastrian government as responsible for their plight
and for the surrender of what Henry V had won. At home, Henry VI
faced the consequences of defeat.
Within three weeks of Castillon, Henry VI suffered a mental and physical
collapse which lasted for 17 months and from which he may never have
fully recovered. The loss of his French kingdom (and Henry was the only
English king to be crowned in France) may have been responsible for his
breakdown, though by 1453 other aspects of his rule gave cause for
grave concern. Those in whom Henry confided, notably the dukes of
Suffolk (murdered 1450) and Somerset (killed in battle at St Albans,
1455), proved unworthy of his trust and were widely hated. Those
denied his favour – including Richard, duke of York and the Neville earls

Medieval Britain

of Salisbury and Warwick – were bitter and resentful, and their efforts to
improve their fortunes were blocked by the king and his court. Henry’s
government was close to bankruptcy, and its authority in the provinces
and in Wales and Ireland was becoming paralysed. In the summer of
1450, there occurred the first popular revolt since 1381, led by the
obscure but talented John Cade, who seized London for a few days and
denounced the king’s ministers. The king’s personal responsibility for
England’s plight was inevitably great.

The Wars of the Roses
Henry VI was a well-intentioned man with laudable aspirations in
education and religion; he sought peace with France and wished to
reward his friends and servants. But no medieval king could rule by
good intentions alone. Besides, Henry was extravagant, over-indulgent,
and did not have the qualities of a shrewd and balanced judge of men
and policies. He was intelligent and well educated, but he was the least
experienced of kings and never shook off the youthful dependence on
others which had been the inevitable hallmark of his long minority
(1422–36). Many of his problems were admittedly unavoidable. The dual
126

monarchy created by his father made heavier and more complex
demands than those placed on a mainly military conqueror such as
Edward III or Henry V. His minority was a period of magnate rule which
created vested interests that were not easily surrendered when the king
came of age – particularly by his uncle, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester,
and his great-uncle, Henry Beaufort, cardinal-bishop of Winchester.
Moreover, after Gloucester’s death in 1447, Henry was the only surviving
descendant of Henry IV in the senior male line, a fact which led him to
distrust the duke of York, the heir of that earl of March who had been
passed over in 1399. There was, then, ample reason for disenchantment
with late Lancastrian rule, and in Richard of York there was a potential
leader of the discontented.
Despite the king’s illness, the birth of a son to his abrasive queen in
October 1453 strengthened the Lancastrian dynasty, but it hardly
As England’s premier duke and Henry’s cousin, York was twice
appointed protector of the realm during the king’s incapacity (1454–5,
1455–6). But as such he aroused the queen’s fierce hostility which
erupted in the ‘battles’ of Blore Heath and Ludford Bridge (September–
October 1459), and in the subsequent Parliament at Coventry which
victimized York, the Nevilles, and their supporters. This alienation of
powerful men by a regime with a disastrous record at home and abroad
led York to claim the Crown in October 1460. After his death at
Wakefield soon after, his son Edward took it for himself on 4 March 1461,
with the aid of the earl of Warwick. The period of dynastic war that is
popularly known as the Wars of the Roses was now well under way amid
conditions that had been ripening during the 1450s.
The new Yorkist monarch, Edward IV, suffered from a cardinal
disadvantage: the deposed king, his queen, and his son were still at
large. They thus provided a focus for their adherents and their Scots and
French sympathizers, who were only too eager to embarrass a weak
English regime. After Henry’s capture in the north (1465), Edward felt
127

improved the immediate prospect for the realm or for Richard of York.

more secure, though even then the former king was kept a prisoner in
the Tower of London and his queen and son received shelter in
Scotland and then in France. More serious still was Edward’s failure to
gain broad support from the English magnates and their clients.
Furthermore, in the late 1460s he gradually alienated his powerful
‘kingmaker’, the earl of Warwick, who (like Northumberland after
1399) came to resent Edward’s growing independence. Edward was
also deserted by his feckless brother, George, duke of Clarence. These
various elements combined to plot rebellion (1469) and, with
encouragement from Louis XI of France, came to an uneasy
agreement in July 1470 with the exiled Lancastrian Queen Margaret.
Warwick, Clarence, Lancastrians, and dissident Yorkists returned to
England and sent Edward IV fleeing to his ally, the duke of Burgundy.
They promptly restored (or ‘readepted’) Henry VI, the first English

Medieval Britain

king to have two separate reigns (1422–61, 1470–1). When Henry’s
Parliament assembled in November 1470, the chancellor was
appealing beyond Westminster to the country at large when he took
as the text of his opening sermon, ‘Return O backsliding children,
saith the Lord’.
But the deposed Edward, like Henry VI before him, was at liberty and he
was able to raise a force with Burgundian help. Moreover, Henry’s
restored regime was undermined by a series of conflicting loyalties and
mutually exclusive interests. Thus, when Edward returned to England in
March 1471, he was able to defeat and kill Warwick at Barnet before
marching west to vanquish at Tewkesbury the Lancastrian queen and
prince, who had only just returned from France. At last Edward IV was
dynastically secure: Queen Margaret was captured after Tewkesbury,
her son was slain in the battle, and on the very night Edward returned
triumphantly to London (21 May) Henry VI died in the Tower, most
probably murdered. The main Lancastrian royal line was extinct. The
Yorkist dissidents were either cowed or dead, and Clarence, though for a
time reconciled with his brother, was subsequently executed for further
indiscretions in 1478.
128

The relative political security which Edward enjoyed in the 1470s
allowed him to attempt a period of constructive rule. He tried to repair
England’s reputation abroad by alliances with Brittany, Burgundy, and
Scotland, and also by retracing the steps of previous kings to France. His
expedition of 1475 was a near-disaster when his Breton and Burgundian
allies proved fickle, but in the treaty of Picquigny Louis XI provided him
with a handsome financial inducement to retire to England. Edward’s
attempts to reorganize the government’s financial administration were
on lines suggested during the Lancastrian period. If he pleased
Parliament by declaring his readiness to rule without special taxes, his
desire to reward friends and attract political supporters meant that he
could embark on no consistent programme of increasing his revenues.
He curried favour with merchants and Londoners, participating in trade
on his own account and maintaining good relations with Flanders and
the Hanse League of German ports. Above all, the stability of his later
officers of state.
Why, then, did the Wars of the Roses not come to an end and why did
not posterity come to know of a Tudor dynasty only among the
squirearchy of North Wales? The Yorkists fell victim in 1483–5 to two of
the most common hazards to afflict a personal monarchy: a minority
and a ruthlessly ambitious royal kinsman. When Edward IV died on
9 April 1483, his son and heir, Edward, was 12. His minority need not
have been long, and in any case England had weathered previous
minorities without undue difficulty. But the degeneration of political
behaviour since the 1450s, especially the often arbitrary, ruthless, and
illegal actions of Edward IV, Warwick, and Clarence, made Edward V’s
accession particularly perilous. The Yorkist brothers, Edward, Clarence,
and Gloucester, seem to have been unable to outgrow aristocratic
attitudes to embrace the obligations of kingship in the short time their
dynasty was on the throne. Edward relied on a circle of magnates, most
of them linked with his own or his wife’s Woodville family, to extend his
authority in the kingdom: Gloucester in the north, the Woodvilles in
129

Still at War, 1390–1490

years owed much to the continuity of service of several able and loyal

Wales, and Lord Hastings in the Midlands. It worked well enough while
Edward lived, but in 1483 the dangers of relying on an exclusive faction
surfaced. Mistrust, particularly between Gloucester and the Woodvilles,
undermined the ruling circle, and those outside it – not least the longestablished Percies in the north and the duke of Buckingham in Wales
and the West Midlands – saw their opportunity.
In these circumstances, the character and ambition of the sole
remaining Yorkist brother, the 30-year-old Richard of Gloucester, led
him to contemplate seizing his young nephew’s Crown for himself. He
usurped the throne on 26 June, imprisoned (and probably murdered)
Edward V and his brother, ‘The Princes in the Tower’, and executed the
queen’s brother and Lord Hastings. His only concession to customary
rules of inheritance of the Crown was his unprincipled declaration that

Medieval Britain

Edward IV and his sons were bastards; he ignored the children of
Clarence. Richard III’s actions and methods led to a revival of dynastic
warfare. In October 1483, the duke of Buckingham, who was descended
from Edward III’s fifth son, Thomas, rebelled. More successful was the
landing from France in August 1485 of Henry Tudor, though his claim to
the throne through his mother, representing the illegitimate Beaufort
line of Edward III’s son, John, was tenuous. Nevertheless, at Bosworth
Field on 22 August 1485 he vanquished and slew King Richard III. By
then, Richard’s own royal line seemed bankrupt: his wife and his only
son were already dead.
A number of factors enabled Henry VII to keep his Crown after
Bosworth. Alone among the usurpers of the fifteenth century, he was
fortunate to have slain his childless predecessor in battle. The support
which he received from the disillusioned Yorkists was crucial, especially
that of Edward IV’s queen. Also England’s magnates were war-weary:
their ranks were depleted, and in some cases their territorial power was
either weakened or destroyed. As a result, attempts to dethrone Henry
were poorly supported in England and the Yorkist pretenders (such as
Lambert Simnel in 1487) failed to carry conviction. The actual fighting

the armies involved may not have been very large; but the significance
of a battle need bear no relation to the numbers engaged or the
casualties sustained. The Wars of the Roses came close to destroying
the hereditary basis of the English monarchy and Henry Tudor’s seizure
of the Crown hardly strengthened it. Henry posed as the representative
and inheritor of both Lancaster and York, but in reality he became king,

and determined to remain king, by his own efforts.

132

Chapter 8
Towards a Nation

Royal Administration and Parliament
English kings enjoyed a mastery in their kingdom which French
monarchs might have envied, and the Crown embodied the unity of
England. Its wearer was not as other men. The coronation ceremony
stressed his semi-spiritual quality, which seemed proven by the alleged
power of the royal touch to cure the skin disease scrofula. Richard II
insisted that those who approached him should bend the knee, and
‘Majesty’ became the common address in the fifteenth century.
The tentacles of royal administration – enabling decisions, grants of
taxation, and legal pronouncements to be implemented – stretched to
the extremities of the British Isles in every direction but the north and
west. The franchises of the bishop of Durham and the earl of Chester
stood outside the shire system of England and had a special
independence. But there was no question of their being beyond the
reach of the king’s government: the bishops of Durham were almost
always the king’s choice and, like Anthony Bek (d. 1311) and Thomas
Langley (d. 1437), often royal councillors; whilst after 1301 the earl of
Chester was also Prince of Wales and the king’s eldest son, and for most
of the later Middle Ages the king administered Cheshire because there
was no adult earl.
The king’s administration was a co-operative affair. In each county the
133

sheriffs and the newer justices of the peace functioned best with the aid
of the nobility and local gentry, whose interests in turn were securely
tied to the monarch, the greatest single source of wealth and patronage
in the realm. Parliament, with its commons’ representatives from
counties and towns between Carlisle and Cornwall, Shrewsbury and
Suffolk, came to play an essential part in late medieval government. By
Edward I’s reign, war and domestic upheaval had fortified the king’s
need to consult his subjects (‘the community of the realm’, as
contemporaries termed them) and to seek their advice in reaching and
implementing decisions affecting the realm at large. It also seemed
wise, from time to time, to include local representatives as well as lay
and ecclesiastical lords in a central assembly that was Parliament. The
wish to tap the wealth of townsmen and smaller landowners as well as
the nobility; the need for material aid and expressions of support in war

Medieval Britain

and political crises; and the advisability of having the weight of a
representative assembly behind controversial or novel changes in the
law or in economic and social arrangements – all these factors
combined to give Parliament a frequency (it met on average once a year
during 1327–1437), distinctive functions, and established procedures,
and to give the commons’ representatives a permanent role in it from
1337 onwards. This institution, unique among the parliaments of
medieval Europe, discussed both important matters of business and
minor matters raised by individuals. It won a monopoly of taxing
Englishmen; it was the highest court in the land; and it made new law
and modified existing law through legislation. Even the commons’
representatives won privileges for themselves, not least free speech and
freedom from arrest during parliamentary sittings. It remained
essentially an instrument of government at the king’s disposal, but it
could sometimes criticize his policies and ministers (as in the 1370s and
1380s and the 1440s), though almost never the king himself. When the
practical needs that had brought Parliament into existence and
encouraged its development disappeared, it met far less often: only
once in every three years on average between 1453 (the end of the
Hundred Years War) and 1509.
134

Communications, Propaganda, and Government
The commons’ representatives had to be informed, courted, and
persuaded before they returned home to their constituents,
considerable numbers of whom desired information about affairs. It
was, after all, they who paid taxes, served in war and defence, and who
were asked for their co-operation and obedience. The government was,
therefore, well advised to weigh carefully the news it transmitted to the
realm and the opinions it hoped the king’s subjects would adopt. Welldeveloped methods of communication and propaganda were used to
this end. The preambles of official proclamations could popularize a
policy and justify a practice: Edward IV’s proclamation against
Margaret, queen of the deposed Henry VI, made much of the memory
of Archbishop Scrope of York, who had been executed by Henry’s
grandfather and had since taken on the aura of a martyr. This was skilful
proclamations were sent to every shire for public reading and display.
Songs and ballads reached wide audiences too, and some that were
officially inspired stressed the glories of Agincourt out of all proportion.
Sermons were no less effective in moulding opinion and mobilizing
support: in 1443 Henry VI requested that good, stirring preachers be
sent through every diocese to reinforce from the pulpit royal appeals for
money for yet another French campaign. Coronations, royal progresses,
and the formal entries of kings and queens into York, Bristol, and
Gloucester (as well as London) were occasions for lavish displays of
official propaganda, harnessing mythology, Christianity, and patriotism.
In 1417, Henry V was portrayed for all to see at his reception by London
as a soldier of Christ returning from crusade against the French. If any
citizen harboured lingering doubts about the justice of his invasion of
France, this was calculated to remove them.
The circulation of letters to inform, persuade, and justify was as near as
the pre-printing age came to publication; such letters soon found their
way into popular chronicles. In this way, Henry V reported to his
135

Towards a Nation

propaganda to sustain opposition to the Lancastrian dynasty, for

subjects the progress of his French campaigns. Even fashionable writers
of the day became official propagandists. In the fifteenth century,
authors rarely produced their works unsolicitedly. Thomas Hoccleve was
a humble government bureaucrat who was paid by Henry V to produce
laudatory verses about Agincourt and the English siege of Rouen (1419).
John Lydgate was patronized by Henry VI and his court over a long
period, implanting in the popular mind all the jingoism that could be
wrung out of the successful defence of Calais against Burgundian attack
in 1436.
The king, his court, and his ministers – the principal exploiters of these
channels of communication – resided most often at Westminster,
London, or Windsor. The shrine of English monarchy was Westminster
Abbey, and Parliament usually met at Westminster (all 31 Parliaments

Medieval Britain

did so between 1339 and 1371, and none met elsewhere after 1459). The
departments of government gradually settled into permanent offices at
Westminster or, to a lesser extent, London, which was the largest and
wealthiest city in the land. In the later Middle Ages, it became the
undisputed capital of the kingdom in every sphere except the
ecclesiastical (where Canterbury remained the seat of the primate of All
England). Along with Westminster and the growing riverside suburb in
between, London became the administrative, commercial, cultural, and
social focus for the kingdom. Government increased in extent,
sophistication, and tempo in the later Middle Ages, particularly in
wartime: regular taxes had to be collected and managed, frequent
meetings of Parliament were held, the customs service was developed,
the practicalities of war and defence had to be organized, and law and
order throughout the kingdom were supervised there. Concentrated,
co-ordinated, and sedentary government was the result. York lost its
claims as a rival centre when the persistent war with Scotland in the first
third of the fourteenth century was overtaken by the much greater
preoccupation with France. Moreover, the absence of Edward III and
Henry V on campaign abroad emphasized the trend towards a fixed,
centralized governmental headquarters that could operate without the
136

participation of the king himself. The crisis of 1339–41 brought home to
Edward III that he could no longer take the machine of government with
him, as Edward I and his predecessors had done. By 1340 the exchequer
had returned to Westminster, which it never left again. The bureaucracy
of the king’s chancery, exchequer, and law courts expanded in the
capital and, as a group of ambitious small landowners, in the
neighbouring counties. Magnates, bishops, and abbots acquired inns or
houses in or near the city, and the surnames of London’s inhabitants
and the language they spoke suggest that many humbler folk were
migrating to the capital from every part of the kingdom – and from
Wales and Ireland too.

Towards an Anglicized Church
The English character of the Church in England was its second most
Catholic faith and doctrine which it shared with other Latin churches.
But it was widely accepted that this universal Church, headed by the
pope in Rome as spiritual father, was a family of individual churches,
each with its own character and autonomy. The Englishness of the
Church in England became more pronounced in the later Middle Ages as
the ecclesiastical dimension of English nationhood. This owed
something to the English language and the separate experience of the
English people, and a good deal to English law and custom, the
framework within which Englishmen (including the clergy) lived and
which the king swore to uphold in his coronation oath. Moreover, the
Church of England, including its buildings, had been established,
encouraged, and patronized by English kings, noblemen, gentry, and
townsmen, giving them a personal and family interest in individual
churches and their priests. The bishops were great landowners – the
bishop of Winchester had an annual income of £3,900 in the midfifteenth century – who sat in Parliament and were among the king’s
councillors. They, and lesser dignitaries too, were usually promoted
because they were trusted by, and useful to, the Crown and could be

significant and enduring quality in the later Middle Ages. Its first was the

Map 5. The pre-Reformation dioceses of England and Wales (thirteenth

rewarded in the Church without cost to the exchequer. There were,
then, good practical reasons why Englishmen should control the English
Church and mould its character and personnel. This seemed the more
urgent during the French wars. In 1307 and regularly thereafter, the
pope’s role in the organization and administration of the English
Church, even in the appointment of bishops, was bitterly opposed. After
all, most popes in the fourteenth century were French-born, and during
1308–78 they lived at Avignon, where they were in danger of becoming
lap-dogs of the French (or so it was widely believed). By contrast, only
one pope had been an Englishman (in the mid-twelfth century) and
none had ever visited England – and nor would one do so until 1982.
The trend towards an Anglicized Church can be illustrated in several
ways. Church law, based on the codes of the early Fathers and
replenished by papal legislation, was received and generally applied in
ecclesiastical matters was acknowledged. But in practice, Church law
was limited by royal authority, particularly when clerks accused of
crimes tried to claim ‘benefit of clergy’. From Edward I’s day, the pope’s
ability to tax the English clergy was severely curtailed and most papal
taxes found their way into the king’s coffers instead of fuelling the
enemy’s war effort (as many believed). More serious still were the
limitations on the pope’s power to appoint bishops and other important
members of the English Church from the mid-fourteenth century
onwards, and during the Great Schism (1378–1417, when there were
two, sometimes three, popes simultaneously claiming Christendom’s
allegiance), the pope whom England supported was in no position to
resist. The anti-papal statutes of Provisors (1351, reissued 1390) and
Praemunire (1353, extended 1393) were used by English kings to impose
a compromise on the pope whereby the initiative in appointments
rested with the king. As a result, very few foreigners were appointed in
the English Church by the fifteenth century unless, as with Henry VII’s
nomination of three Italian bishops, they had the government’s specific
approval.
139

the Church courts of England, and the pope’s ultimate jurisdiction in

Few clergymen in England protested at this state of affairs. The
bishops did not do so because of the men they were and the way in
which they were appointed. The Church did not do so corporately
because it feared papal taxation. The clergy did not do so because
English kings were the protectors of the faith against heretics and
a buttress against anticlerical attack. In 1433, even an abbot of
St Albans could declare that ‘the king knows no superior to himself
within the realm’.

Devotional Writings and Lollardy
Predominantly English in character were two expressions of religious
fervour outside the institutional church of late medieval England: the
devotional fashion was strictly orthodox in theology, whereas the

Medieval Britain

Lollard movement inspired by John Wycliffe was heretical. The
fourteenth century saw a burgeoning interest in mystical and
devotional writings, most of them in English from the latter part of the
century and appealing to a growing literate public. Such people took for
granted the teachings and practices of the Church but preferred a
personal, intuitive devotion focused on the sufferings and death of
Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Lives of Saints, collected in the Golden
Legend. The writers were frequently solitary figures commending the
contemplative life to their readers. By far the most popular devotional
works were by Richard Rolle, a Yorkshire hermit, and, later, by the
recluse, Dame Juliane of Norwich. The Book of Margery Kempe, the
spiritual autobiography of the wife of a Lynn burgess, exemplified the
virtues which lay men and women sought, and the revelations, visions,
and ecstasies by which they came to possess them. Laymen such as
Henry, duke of Lancaster (who in 1354 wrote a devotional work of his
own in French), and devout women such as Lady Margaret Beaufort,
mother of Henry VII, turned to this intense spiritual life as a reaction to
the arid theological discussions of scholars, though they did not stray
into the unorthodoxy of Lollardy whose spiritual roots were not
dissimilar.
140

Lollardy (probably a name derived from lollaer, a mumbler – of prayers)
was the only significant heretical movement to sweep through medieval
England, and Wycliffe was the only university intellectual in the history
of medieval heresy to inspire a popular heretical movement against the
Church. It was a largely indigenous English scheme of thought that laid
great store by books and reading. Though Wycliffe is unlikely to have
written in English, he inspired a series of English polemical works and
also the first complete translation of the Bible by 1396. To begin with, he
appealed to the anticlerical temper of his times and gained reputation
and support among noblemen, courtiers, and scholars for his criticism
of the Church’s wealth and the unworthiness of too many of its clergy.
But his increasingly radical theological ideas, placing overwhelming
confidence in Holy Scripture, led to his condemnation and withdrawal
from Oxford. The sympathy which he had received from influential men
ebbed away when confronted with the strict orthodoxy of Henry IV
heresy) and almost disappeared when Lollardy became tinged with
rebellion in Sir John Oldcastle’s rising. Deprived of its intellectual spring
and its powerful protectors, Lollardy became a disjointed, unorganized
but obstinate movement of craftsmen, artisans, and poor priests in the
Welsh borderland and industrial towns of the Midlands. Their beliefs
became more and more disparate and eccentric, but their basic hostility
to ecclesiastical authority, their devotion to the Scriptures, and their
belief in an English Bible prefigured the Reformation and were to be
central convictions in later English Protestantism.

The Spread of Literacy and the English Language
The spread of literacy and the increased use of the English language
were twin developments of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
They were symptomatic of Englishmen’s growing awareness of public
affairs, and reflect feelings of patriotism and nationhood.
It is easier to be persuaded of all this than to prove it in detail. There are
141

Towards a Nation

(who added burning in 1401 to the armoury of the persecutors of

no contemporary estimates of how rapidly and how far literacy spread;
nor is it possible for us to quantify it with the data provided by largely
innumerate contemporaries. A rough index of its growth becomes
available if the statutes of 1351 and 1499 defining the legal privilege of
‘benefit of clergy’ (then the literate class) are compared. In 1351 it was
stated that all laymen who could read should be accorded ‘benefit of
clergy’. One hundred and fifty years later, the situation had so changed
that a distinction was drawn between mere lay scholars and clerks in
holy orders, and only to the latter was ‘benefit of clergy’ now to be
extended. Maybe the literate class had expanded to the point where
‘clerical’ was a meaningless adjective to apply to it, though the statute
of 1499 attributed the need for change to abuse rather than to the
expansion itself.

Medieval Britain

An equally generalized indication is provided by comparing the two
popular risings of the later Middle Ages – the Peasants’ Revolt (1381)
and John Cade’s rebellion (1450). In 1381 the complaints of the
peasantry from Kent and Essex were (as far as we know) presented to
Richard II orally, and all communications with the king during the
revolt appear to have been by word of mouth; at the Tower of
London, Richard had to ask that the rebels’ grievances, hitherto
roared at him by the insurgents outside, be put in writing for him to
consider. Compare this with 1450, when the demands of Cade’s
followers, also drawn from Kent and the south-east, were submitted
at the outset in written form of which several versions were produced
and circulated. They are long documents, with a coherent and
comprehensive argument, expressed in English, sometimes of a
colloquial kind. The business of publishing manuscripts was extending
its range at this very time. John Shirley (d. 1456) is known to have run
his business from four rented shops near St Paul’s Cathedral and to
have produced, for sale or loan, ‘little ballads, complaints and
roundels’. Twenty years later, customs accounts document the
importation of large quantities of manuscript books through London –
over 1,300 in 1480–1 alone.
142

One may cautiously introduce some figures to indicate that late
medieval literacy was not confined to the noble, clerical, or
governmental classes. As was probably the case with Cade’s rebels,
some artisans and craftsmen could now read and write. Eleven out of
28 witnesses in a legal suit of 1373 described themselves as literatus (or
capable of understanding Latin and therefore, one presumes, English
too); and a mid-fifteenth century will provided a similar proportion of
‘literates’ among witnesses who included merchants, husbandmen,
tailors, and mariners. There were doubtless others whom, literate or
not, one would never dream of employing as witnesses, but we are
undeniably moving towards Sir Thomas More’s enthusiastic estimate at
the beginning of the sixteenth century that more than 50 per cent of
Englishmen were literate.
If we cannot accept such figures with complete confidence, we can at
occupations. They filled some of the highest political offices in the land
hitherto reserved for clerics: from 1381, laymen frequently became
Treasurer of England, an office for which a command of reading and
writing – if not of figures – was an essential qualification. Literate
laymen were employed as clerks in government service, a niche which
the poet Thomas Hoccleve occupied for over 35 years. It is also clear that
by 1380 tradesmen were keeping written bills; soon afterwards country
yeomen were writing – certainly reading – private letters, and even
peasants who served as reeve on their manor were functioning in an
administrative environment whose business was increasingly transacted
on paper and parchment. By Edward III’s time, the rules and regulations
of some craft guilds were insisting on a recognized standard of literacy
for their apprentices.
The reading habits of at least well-to-do laymen reflect the same thing.
Reading chronicles was very popular, and not only in London; the
surviving manuscripts alone run into hundreds and show signs of being
produced in increasing numbers as the fifteenth century wore on, most

least observe literate men – rarely women – at work in a variety of

of them in English. Merchants and others took to owning ‘commonplace books’, those personal, diminutive libraries of poems, prophecies,
chronicles, and even recipes, through which they browsed at leisure.
They possessed books and carefully disposed of them – particularly the
religious and devotional ones – in their wills.
This literate world was increasingly an English world. The facility to
speak and understand French (and therefore to read and write it) was in
marked decline before the end of the fourteenth century; even for
official and formal business in government and private organizations,
English was becoming at least as common. Discussions in Parliament
were taking place in English by the middle decades of the century, and
the first written record of this dates from 1362. Although only a rough
and ready guide, it is worth noting that the earliest known property

Medieval Britain

deed drawn up in English is dated 1376, the earliest will 1387. The
proceedings of the convocation of Canterbury were conducted in
English quite often by the 1370s, and Henry IV spoke to Parliament in
English in 1399 and had his words carefully recorded. The reasons for
this quiet revolution are complex, but among them may be numbered
the patriotism generated by the long French war; the popularity of
Lollardy, which set great store by English books and sermons; the lead
given by the Crown and the nobility; and, of course, the greater
participation of the English-speaking subject in the affairs of the realm,
not least in Parliament. The triumph of the written language was
assured.
Before that happened, one major problem had to be faced: that of
regional dialects. Only then could the full potential of English as a
written and spoken tongue be realized. It must be admitted that in this
first century or so of popular, literate English, quaint Cornish, wilfully
foreign Welsh, and such unintelligibilities as the Yorkshire dialect could
not be fully absorbed into a common idiom; but much headway was
made. The spreading tentacles of government helped, developing and
extending the use of a written language for official communication
144

throughout the realm during the first half of the fifteenth century. A
further factor was the emergence in the fourteenth century of London
as the settled capital of the kingdom, with York as a subsidiary
administrative centre and Bristol as the second commercial metropolis,
each evolving a dialect that inevitably became comprehensible to the
others and gradually fused in a standardized English. This dialect was
predominantly midland English, which triumphed at the expense of a
city-bound tongue; and for this reason it was the more easily adopted in
rural shires. That the victor was a midland dialect was in large part due
to the substantial migration of midlanders and easterners to London in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Lollardy was partly responsible
too, for it was especially vigorous in the Midlands and West Country,
and most of its written works were in varying forms of the midland
tongue. By capturing London, this midland dialect in speech and writing
captured the kingdom.

would be understood across England – and he wrote for a limited,
charmed circle.
And for there is so great diversity
In English and in writing of our tongue
So pray I God that none miswrite thee,
Nor thee mismetre for default of tongue.
And read whereso thou be, or else sung
That thou be understood, God I beseech.

In a legal case of 1426, it was stated that words were pronounced
differently in different parts of England ‘and one is just as good as the
other’. Half a century later, William Caxton could be more optimistic
that his printed editions of several hundreds would, with care, be quite
comprehensible from one shire to another. He realized that ‘common
English that is spoken in one shire varieth from another’; but by using
‘English not over rude, nor curious, but in such terms as shall be
145

Towards a Nation

Geoffrey Chaucer had serious misgivings as to whether his writings

understood by God’s grace’, he anticipated little difficulty. The greater
ease of understanding, in both speech and writing, that had developed
meanwhile was crucial to the effectiveness of communication, the
common expression of opinion, and the forging of a sense of
nationhood.
English had become ‘the language, not of a conquered, but of a
conquering people’. The self-confidence of its writers reached the
heights of genius in Chaucer, and it attracted patronage from the
wealthiest and most influential in the realm – from kings, noblemen,
gentlemen, and townsmen. English prose in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries was far outshone in quality and popularity by English
verse in all its forms: lyric and romance, comedy and tragedy, allegory
and drama. Much of this poetry fell squarely in the northern European

Medieval Britain

tradition, and the literary revival of the north-west and the Midlands in
the fourteenth century was mainly of alliterative, unrhymed verse. But it
was sponsored by local gentry and magnates such as the Bohuns (earls
of Hereford) and the Mortimers (earls of March), and could produce
works of considerable imaginative power in Sir Gawain and the Green
Knight and Piers Plowman. In the same region, ritual Christian drama in
the English Miracle Play Cycles was developed during the fourteenth
century and achieved great popularity in northern towns such as York,
Beverley, Wakefield, and Chester, where the plays were organized and
performed by the town guilds.
At the same time, in the south and east, a newer mode of verse was
appearing which owed more to current fashions of style and content in
French and early Renaissance Italian writing. Through the pen of
Chaucer, and to a lesser extent his friend John Gower, it created
masterpieces of English literature. These were unequalled in their
richness of thought and vocabulary, their imagination and depth of
human understanding, and in their sheer artistry. Troilus and Criseyde,
written about 1380–5, and especially the immensely ambitious and
complex panorama of The Canterbury Tales (written 1386–1400 but never
146

completed), decisively extended English literary accomplishment. They
displayed a wisdom, worldliness, and inventiveness, and a mastery of
contemporary English idiom in all its variety, which earn Chaucer his
place as the greatest English medieval writer.
Gower, a Kentishman, was patronized by Richard II and, later, by Henry
Bolingbroke. Chaucer, who came of London merchant stock, grew up in
aristocratic and royal circles, and he was one of the most lionized and
richly rewarded poets of any age. This reflects both the extraordinary
quality of his writing, and also the recognition which influential
contemporaries were prepared to give to the English language which he
enriched. If Chaucer’s disciples, Hoccleve and Lydgate, seem secondrate in comparison with their master, at least the royal, court, and city
patronage which these authors received assured a bright future for
what was essentially the English literary school of the capital.

The same sources of wealth and taste were placed at the disposal of
England’s architects and builders. Developing their ideas from the
predominant Gothic style of much of Europe, of which the pointed arch
is the symbol and most characteristic feature, they created architectural
styles which have a good claim to be regarded as distinctively English.
Since the nineteenth century, these have been termed Decorated (more
accurately free-flowing and curvilinear) and Perpendicular (or rather
vertical and rectilinear), and they are best identified in the window and
arch design of England’s cathedrals, larger parish churches, and
colleges. In so far as any new architectural development can be
explained with precision, it is thought that renewed diplomatic and
crusader contacts with the Muslim and Mongol worlds of Egypt and
Persia towards the end of the thirteenth century transmitted
knowledge of Eastern building styles and techniques to the far West.
The delicate tracery and luxuriant naturalistic motifs which are a feature
of the new Decorated style appear on the three surviving Eleanor
147

Towards a Nation

English Architecture

Crosses that Edward I erected in the 1290s to mark the stages in the
journey of his wife’s body from Lincoln to its burial at Westminster.
Eastern influences have also been observed in the hexagonal north
porch and doorway of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, dating from early in the
fourteenth century. After only half a century (1285–1335) of these
extravagant complexities, which were unparalleled in Gothic Europe
and have been hailed as ‘the most brilliant display of sheer inventiveness
in the whole history of English medieval architecture’, a reaction set in.
This reaction produced the most English style of all, the Perpendicular.
In an age when England was at war, this was rarely imitated on the
European mainland. Its simpler, cleaner lines and larger, lighter spaces
may have appeared first in the royal chapel of St Stephen, Westminster
(destroyed 1834), or in the city cathedral of St Paul (burned 1666). Either
way, it quickly spread to the West Country, through courtly influence

Medieval Britain

focused on Edward II’s shrine at Gloucester. It can still be admired on
the grand scale in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, dating from the
mid-1330s, as well as in the later naves of Canterbury (from 1379) and
Winchester (from 1394). Decoration was now concentrated Englishstyle in roof vaulting, culminating in the fan vaults of Hereford’s chapter
house (now destroyed) and the cloisters at Gloucester, which were built
after 1351.
Yet Perpendicular building is found most frequently and at its best in the
greater parish churches of England such as Cirencester, Coventry, and
Hull. Not even plague and warfare, which may have inhibited large-scale
projects for a while in the fifteenth century, could deter clothiers and
landowners in East Anglia and the West Country from lavishing their
wealth on these monuments to English taste and skill. Perpendicular
architecture experienced an exuberant resurgence in the latter part of
the fifteenth century in some of the most famous of English buildings,
most of them sponsored by the Crown – Eton College, St George’s
Chapel, Windsor (from 1474), King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, and
Henry VII’s Chapel in Westminster Abbey. It was incontestably ‘the
Indian Summer of English medieval architecture’.
148

Incomparably English were the Perpendicular towers of late medieval
parish churches, ranging from the sturdy St Giles Church, Wrexham, to
the soaring shaft of St Botolph’s, Boston, and the elegance of Taunton,
St Stephen’s, Bristol, and St John’s, Cardiff. So, too, were the carved
timber roofs of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, beginning with
the timber vault planned for the chapter house at York after 1291, and
the replacement of the tower of Ely Cathedral, which collapsed in 1322,
by a timber vault and lantern tower. This roof work culminated in the
great hammer-beam oak roof of Westminster Hall (1394–1400),
commissioned by Richard II and judged to be ‘the greatest single work
of art of the whole of the European middle ages’. Masons, carpenters,
and architects were patronized by kings, courtiers, noblemen, and
others from the thirteenth century onwards, and not simply for
religious building; they also worked on royal and private castles and
manor houses. Although forming a profession largely based in London
assigned duties throughout England and Wales. They placed their
expertise and experience at the disposal of noblemen and bishops and
thereby created a national style to suit national tastes.

English Nationhood
Englishmen’s sense of nationhood and their awareness of their own
Englishness are not easily gauged. But they sometimes compared
themselves – and were compared by others – to peoples of different
race, language, country, or cultural and political tradition. In the later
Middle Ages, Englishmen confronted, frequently violently, other
peoples both in the British Isles and in mainland Europe. These
confrontations were a forcing-house of nationhood and self-conscious
Englishness. Such experiences gave rise to a number of emotions, which
made English people aware of their nature, unity, and common
traditions and history.
So long as England was ruled by Norman dukes or Angevin counts, and
149

Towards a Nation

and connected with the office of king’s works, these craftsmen were

Anglo-Norman barons held estates on both sides of the Channel and
others did so in both England and Scotland, it was impossible for the
ruling elite to think of itself as exclusively English. But this became
possible once Normandy and Anjou were overrun by the French and
formally surrendered to them in 1259, for the cross-Channel nobility had
then to decide where its prime allegiance lay. It became more likely, too,
with the growing self-consciousness of the Scottish kingdom,
particularly when Edward I’s wars made land-holding across the border
a thing of the past. Thereafter, the separateness of England was
identified with its encircling seas. In the mid-1430s a pamphleteer
advised:
Keep then the seas about in special;
Which of England is the round wall,

Medieval Britain

As though England were likened to a city
And the wall environ were the sea . . .

English kings from Edward I were more truly English in upbringing and
outlook than any since King Harold. Indeed, Henry VI in his 39-year
reign never visited Scotland or Ireland; he only once set foot in Wales – a
day at Monmouth – and never again went to France after his coronation
visit at the age of nine.
As to foreigners, the dominance of Flemings and then Italians in
England’s overseas trade in the thirteenth century fostered resentment
of their commercial success. In Henry VII’s reign Englishmen were said
to ‘have an antipathy to foreigners, and imagine that they never come
into their island but to make themselves master of it and to usurp their
goods. . .’. After all, natives of a country at war with England might, like
the alien priories attached to French monasteries, send money to an
enemy, or, like the servants of Henry IV’s queen, the duchess of Brittany,
act as spies for France. Not for nothing did the king’s clerks scratch
‘Do not show to aliens!’ on state papers at the outset of the Hundred
Years War.
150

England’s wars, waged successfully by humble bowmen as well as
knights and noblemen, created among all ranks a self-confidence that
warmed English hearts. A well-informed observer said in 1373 that ‘the
English are so filled with their own greatness and have won so many big
victories that they have come to believe they cannot lose. In battle, they
are the most confident nation in the world.’ Pride in their victories
seemed unbounded, and individual kings embodied the achievements.
Under Edward III, ‘the realm of England has been nobly amended,
honoured and enriched to a degree never seen in the time of any other
king’, whilst Henry V’s reputation among his subjects reached even
greater heights. Englishmen’s belief in their superiority – a short step
from pride and self-confidence – remained unshaken even in the midfifteenth century, by which time England’s fortunes seemed far less
golden. The wild Gaels were treated as ‘mere Irish’ and the Flemings in
1436 with undisguised scorn:

When ye laid siege to Calais, ye were right still to blame;
For more of reputation, be Englishmen than ye,
And come of more gentle blood, of old antiquity.

An Italian visitor around 1500, when England’s overseas ‘empire’ was all
but lost, could still report that ‘the English are great lovers of
themselves and of everything belonging to them. They think that there
are no other men than themselves, and no other world but England; and
when they see a handsome foreigner they say that “he looks like an
Englishman”, and that “it is a great pity that he should not be an
Englishman”.’ Feelings of superiority easily turned to disdain or even
hate. After decades of war with the French, Francophobia was common
and matched only by the Anglophobia of the French, who came to
regard the English as ‘a race of people accursed’. At no time was this
distaste for things French stronger than during the reign of Henry V. He
may have claimed the French crown, but in England he discouraged the
use of the French language in government and literate society. The
151

Towards a Nation

Remember now, ye Flemings, upon your own shame;

London brewers took their cue from their admired king, and when they
wrote their ordinances in English they noted that ‘our mother tongue,
to wit, the English tongue, hath in modern days begun to be honourably
enlarged and adorned . . . and our most excellent lord, King Henry V,
hath procured the common idiom . . . to be commended by the exercise
of writing.’
Tales of a British past and practical feelings of insecurity had combined
with the vigour and ambition of English kings down to Edward I –
perhaps Edward III – to take the English into Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland. Their success in absorbing these territories was limited; and try
as they might to Anglicize the Welsh and Irish in culture, language, and
habit, the English with their dependent dominions were denied political
nationhood in the later Middle Ages. The English delegation to the

Medieval Britain

Church’s Council at Constance (1414–17) declared:
whether a nation be understood as a people marked off from others by
blood relationship and habit of unity, or by peculiarities of language
(the most sure and positive sign and essence of a nation in divine and
human law) . . . is a real nation . . .

But they spoilt their political case by adding that Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland were part of the English nation.
