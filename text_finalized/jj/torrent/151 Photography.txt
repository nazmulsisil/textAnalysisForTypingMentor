Preface

I must have been mad to agree to write this book; not least,
because the combination ‘very short introduction’ with
‘photography’ seems like an oxymoron. The three or four standard
histories of the medium are all huge volumes. The problem is
simply that photography runs in all directions, permeating diverse
aspects of society. Indeed, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an area of modern
life untouched by it. (Even the cover of this book, ostensibly an
abstract painting, is photomechanically reproduced.) The critic
John Tagg once suggested that there was no single characteristic,
or practice, that represented the fundamental essence of the
medium. Trying to account for photography as a whole, he
suggested, was akin to attempting a history, or a museum, of
writing: all that could be done was to trace the uses of photography
(or writing) in the institutions in which it was put to work – the
law courts, medicine, advertising, art, and so forth. Even if we
reject a strict version of this argument (it seems to me that there
are powerful ideologies underpinning the uses of photography),
attempting to write an introduction to this dispersed ﬁeld feels like
a vain task. The quite distinct versions of photography’s history
unravel attempts to tell a coherent story. This is one of the things
that can make thinking about photography so fascinating, and so
challenging.
In this short book I have not even tried to provide anything like a
xi

comprehensive account: some of the most important aspects of
the ﬁeld – advertising, for instance – barely ﬁgure here. Instead, I
have tried to address some constitutive conditions that give rise to
the values we typically associate with photographs. This approach
means emphasizing the division between art and documentary. I
have also adopted a thematic, rather than chronological,
organization for this book; information on the development of
photography, for instance, is scattered throughout the pages. My
aim has been to embed speciﬁc information in a wider frame – I
hope this approach results in a livelier introduction to the subject,
but the reader may need to actively look for connections. Chapter 1
takes the theme of forgetting as a way of introducing photography.
Chapters 2 and 3 form a complementary pair, providing a survey of
issues and themes associated with the division between ‘documents’
and ‘pictures’. Chapters 4 and 5 go over some of the same ground,
but with a more theoretical emphasis. The ﬁnal chapter returns to
the uses of photography, advancing some thoughts on commodity
culture and memory. I felt that I could not leave the book without a
short coda on the ‘digital image’ and its impact on established
photographic culture.
Outside the museum, we rarely encounter photographs in a pure, or
self-contained, form. Invariably, in actual use photographic images
are combined with language and some other technology.
Photographs often appear on the page (of a book, magazine, or
newspaper), combined with text; they ﬁgure on billboards (again
with words); in archives and ﬁling cabinets; on personal
identiﬁcation documents; in family albums (or, their modern
replacement, the reassigned shoe box); on computer systems; and
so forth. Photography is a hybrid medium, and it is worth
remembering that the way we encounter and use photographic
images frequently involves some other system of communication
and organization. I touch on this combinatory relation in what
follows, but in the main, this book focuses on camera-generated
photochemical images, though I have occasionally drawn my
examples from the related family of technologies that share the
xii

determining conditions of the camera (ﬁlm, television, video, and
digital photography). One ﬁnal point: anyone hoping to ﬁnd a ‘how
to’ manual here will be disappointed.

Chapter 1
Forgetting photography

The question ‘Where is the photograph?’ presupposes that we have
lost sight of photography or that photography is somehow lost; that
it has lost a direction perhaps or that we do not ﬁnd it where it
should be; that it has been misplaced; that it remains somewhere,
unclaimed, in some lost property ofﬁce of culture.
Olivier Richon

In 1865, the photographer James Mudd presented a paper entitled
‘A Photographer’s Dream’ at the Manchester Literary and
Philosophical Society (Photographic Section). Mudd tells the story
of a photographer who falls asleep and wakes in the 29th century.
This fable represents a parody of, what Mudd saw as, the dire state
of photography in the mid-19th century. His goal was to see
photography valued as one of the ﬁne arts (his particular passion
was for picturesque landscapes), but photographers obsessed with
chemical processes and optical devices undermined this ambition.
In his ‘dream’ he was conducted through a swanky new Manchester
to the ‘Grand Focus Photographic Society’. But, whereas he had
expected to ﬁnd photography transformed into art, he encountered
just more of the same. The participants in the Society came up with
one mad scheme after another: a camera, called a pointer, wound
up and sent in search of views; steam proposed to raise
photography to new heights; and so on. Mudd was aghast to ﬁnd
that photography had not really changed in all this time; still no one
1

Photography

seemed interested in art. In fact, it turned out that there had been
little opportunity for progress; he learned that, in the intervening
years, photography had been lost and had only recently been
‘discovered’. This simple tale proposes a period of more than 1,000
years of modern history without photographs. It is a remarkably
interesting idea.
William Bornefeld’s science-ﬁction novel Time and Light is set in a
post-apocalyptic society called Fullerton, where photographs are
forbidden. In place of the seductions of images, the inhabitants of
Fullerton have the ‘pill’ (half anti-depressant, half sexual stimulant).
But, during a scientiﬁc expedition to the (allegedly) irradiated
world beyond the domed city, the central character, Dr Noreen,
discovers 12 ancient photographs from the 20th century. Even
during his medical training Dr Noreen’s contact with pictures had
been restricted to a few diagrams. But when he encounters an
ancient archival facility and takes a packet of images (oddly enough,
all by well-known photographers; including one by the author) he
becomes obsessed with these illicit pictures and ﬂouts the
iconophobic rule that predominates among the last surviving
humans – which Bornefeld calls, in a bad photographic joke,
‘The Family of Man’ – spending hours absorbed in contemplating
an image of peppers by Edward Weston, or Robert Capa’s picture of
a Spanish Republican soldier depicted at the moment of his death.
Noreen is rash enough to show his images to two other citizens:
gradually his promising career and social progress disintegrate
around him. Ultimately, Noreen’s search for more photographs
leads him to challenge the norms and protocols that govern
Fullerton: the ruling bureaucrats respond with the ultimate
iconophobic gesture and surgically destroy his vision.
It is difﬁcult for us to imagine these imageless future times. The
rapid spread of phone technology for making photographs has only
exacerbated this situation: we all now live our lives in the presence
of pictures. Dr Noreen’s world, in which photographs are
prohibited, seems particularly odd because they do so much work in
2

our society that it is hard to imagine the ruling powers voluntarily
renouncing them. However, it seems helpful to begin this short
introduction with Mudd and Bornefeld, and to contemplate a world
without photographs. So let’s leap forward into the imageless
future.

Firstly, hand-drawn images are expensive to produce, because they
require skill and time. When picture production involves the
expenditure of effort, time, and money, images are likely to be
restricted to the illustration of signiﬁcant things. Photography, in
contrast, excels at depicting everyday life and casual appearances.
Consequently, throughout its history, the hand-made image has
been, invariably, reserved for prestigious projects: images of the
powerful and the famous, world historical events, subjects deemed
elevating or worthy of attention by ofﬁcial culture. Imagine, for
instance, the magazines currently on display in any newsagent
deprived of their photographs. Many of these publications depend
for their appeal on their pictures, and a good percentage would,
undoubtedly, cease to exist without them. Would gardening, DIY, or
fashion magazines, or those weird lads’ mags, have half the appeal
without their images? Would anyone go to the time and expense of
reproducing this stuff in the absence of cameras? The people in
Mudd’s future would ﬁnd very few illustrated books, magazines,
and newspapers available to them; even for those who could afford
them, images of their family and friends would be limited to a few
3

Forgetting photography

In Mudd’s future, if not Bornefeld’s, drawings could substitute for
camera-generated images, but drawing is a slow, and highly skilled,
process. One key impetus behind the invention of photography in
the 1830s was the desire to escape from the restrictions imposed by
handcrafted images. What is more, in the absence of photographic
reproduction techniques, if drawings are to be issued in signiﬁcant
numbers they will need to be hand engraved onto a metal plate or
wooden block. Two key consequences result from this laborious
technique: both would signiﬁcantly limit the number of images in
circulation.

Photography

formal portraits. Secondly, whereas photography is more-or-less
instantaneous, even the most rapid sketch requires time to execute.
Moving subjects can only be reproduced as an artist’s impression.
(It took photography to establish the way a running horse plants its
feet.)
In a number of pioneering texts written during the 1920s and
1930s, the German critic Walter Benjamin argued that photography
should be thought of as a technology of the ‘optical unconscious’.
Benjamin’s analogy was with psychoanalysis, which allegedly
brought the murky realms of the unconscious into view: he believed
photography did something similar for the aspects of our world that
eluded standard vision. He had in mind the ability of the camera to
extend human observation beyond its normal parameters. All
manner of instruments are regularly employed to enhance vision:
eye-glasses, magnifying glasses, simple microscopes, and telescopes
to name just a few. Some of these instruments are straightforward
to use and we are readily familiar with their results. These optical
devices are, though, designed to be used individually and
communicating their ﬁndings can be difﬁcult. What an observer
sees in a simple microscope or telescope can be recorded in a
drawing, but doing so requires a great deal of skill and patience: the
objects of study often move or metamorphose, and the focus of
attention has to be repeatedly shifted from the eyepiece to the
paper. (There are plenty of examples in which what the observer
recorded did not exist.)
The camera is particularly suited for combination with optical
devices because the instrument can be substituted for the regular
lens and rapid modern shutters and ﬁlms allow for an almost
instantaneous arrest of motion. In this way, images otherwise
invisible to the eye can be revealed. Some complex instruments –
scanning microscopes, ultrasound scanners, and so forth – require a
photographic image (or video/computer screen) to manifest their
results: there is nothing to see in the absence of photographic ﬁlm
or screen. Images from inaccessible places are also made available
4

by photographers (not many of us are likely to explore the depths of
the ocean). Satellite photographs of the Earth and its weather
systems, or images of distant planets, are only possible from a point
of view that is literally ‘out of this world’. The ability to make
pictures at a fraction of a second (or in ﬁlm to slow down motion
and freeze frame) brings things that we could otherwise never
observe into focus: we are able to discern whether the ball crossed
the line or to capture a humming bird in ﬂight. Infrared
photography allows us to see in the dark, while telescopic
photography enables observers to record dangerous events at a safe
distance (or to spy and pry). If we add the microcameras that enable
medics to see inside the body without the need for invasive surgery
to this list, the stakes are raised once more. Much of our world
would be invisible to those in the imageless future cities of
Manchester and Fullerton.

Much of our familiarity with our world comes through
photographic visualization as a surrogate for ﬁrst-hand experience
of places, objects, creatures, and events. Photographs have made
many things seem ordinary, bringing distant places or unusual
things closer to us, but, at the same time, our reliance on them has
been at the cost of making much of our experience seem secondhand. It is startling to think how much of our knowledge comes
through the medium of photography: how many of us have actually
5

Forgetting photography

It is difﬁcult to grasp just how much would be lost to us under
these circumstances. Most of all, I suspect, the inhabitants of
the future would miss out on pictures of simple appearances:
the look of a volcano erupting, or a close-up of a dragonﬂy’s
wings; the pattern made by a drop of water, or the record of a
daft outﬁt worn at a party. The world would seem much less
knowable in the absence of these images: our familiarity with
tropical islands and deserts, anacondas and aardvarks, stems, in
the main, from lens-based imagery. (Perhaps zoological and
botanical gardens would undergo a spectacular revival in the
photo-less millennia.)

Photography

seen a polar ice ﬂow or a refugee camp? Yet we are able to describe
the appearance of both. In this sense, we relate to our world through
the ‘second nature’ of technology. Photography occupies a central
role in that process. An iconophobic future might make some
important gains by dispensing with the mediation of cameras, but
the costs would be immense. Images associated with the optical
unconscious have played a fundamental role in demystifying our
world; without them enchantment would have a greater grip on our
understanding.
As we have already observed, in Mudd’s future dependence on
drawings would mean the everyday images of friends and relatives,
pets and prized possessions, would be likely to disappear: there
would be no envelopes stuffed with pictures from high days and
holidays. These things are completely absent from Noreen’s
Fullerton. In these imageless societies, it is likely that many people
would leave no visual trace of their lives. This was the condition for
most of the world’s inhabitants before photography (early
photographers often dreamed of a photograph of Shakespeare), and
after its loss, or eradication, most people would return to what the
critic Siegfried Kracaeur called, in another context, ‘imageless
oblivion’. However, this situation would, once again, allow the
prestige of pictures to devolve to the rich and powerful. (For the
poor and the powerless, the ability to avoid the ofﬁcial gaze has
some deﬁnite advantages.)
The modern state employs photographs (and other related
lens-based media) in myriad ways, and, at least, in Bornefeld’s
full version of ‘imageless oblivion’ its operations would be
considerably hampered by their absence. In addition to political
‘spin’ and promotion, images of this kind are used for
disseminating public information; trafﬁc control; recording
forensic evidence and presenting that evidence in court;
surveillance in banks, city streets, or on demonstrations; for
staking out a criminal suspect and recording his or her contacts.
Perhaps, most of all, photographs are employed to produce
6

There are some phenomena in our society that are, to a large
extent, the products of photography and could not survive in these
future worlds, or at least could not do so in their present form.
Two examples will have to make the point. Celebrity is one of
those phenomena that could hardly exist without the camera.
Fame predates photography, but celebrity developed with the
image technology of industrial capitalism. In the 1860s British
dealers regularly ordered 10,000 photographs of prominent
celebrities. The revival of the popularity of the British royal family
dates from roughly the moment around the middle of the
19th century when they began to promote themselves as homely
bourgeois citizens. Photography played an important role in this
process. The ﬁrst photograph of a member of the British royal
family to be shown in public appeared in 1857; within a few days of
its issue, in 1860, 60,000 sets of Mayall’s photographic Royal
Album had been ordered. From the point at which image and text
7

records of individuals. All manner of ofﬁcial documents demand
portraits of their holders, including passports, driving licences,
library cards, and so forth. In many parts of the world people are
obliged to carry identity cards (British citizens may soon be
required to join them). Imagine how much easier it would be to take
on a different identity before – or after – photography. Charles
Dickens gave a great description of the trouble it took to identify
individuals in a period before their likenesses could be
photographically produced. For example, jailers were required to
scrutinize each prisoner and memorize his or her appearance. The
police began using photography seriously in the 1870s. With the
emergence of ﬁngerprinting, and subsequently DNA testing,
photography occupies a less central place in identiﬁcation. But,
while these other technologies allow identity to be conﬁrmed,
photographs make it much easier to spot an individual. In Noreen’s
future, the police can keep tabs on everyone because there are so
few remaining people; in contrast, Mudd’s millennia without
photographs must offer lots of possibilities for becoming invisible,
for moving city and starting over.

Photography

could be produced in mass editions (the late 19th century), a
symbiosis took place between popular journalism and celebrity: the
publicity-hungry could then keep themselves in the public eye,
while the media traded on this visibility. The modern tabloid press
feeds on celebrity pictures, even if these days they show
considerably less reverence for their subjects. Increasingly,
paparazzi work has become more prying and voyeuristic, but this

logic is implicit in the celebrity image. To be famous in Fullerton,
you actually have to produce something, or do something, even if
only the bad poetry-cum-rock-and-roll of chief poet Kafahvey.

Noreen trained as a medical doctor with a few diagrams and the
experience of the dissecting table, but modern medicine would be
severely hampered without its images. Medical training combines
dissection with study from photographs (or photographically
reproduced illustrations). It can be easier to identify a particular
pathological condition from an abstracted image than from the
contingent forms it actually takes. Photographs make available an
archive of diseases unfamiliar to the individual doctor or nurse. No
doubt, in the absence of photographs, memory would ﬁnd other
ruses for recording these things, but picturing them is highly
convenient. While the X-ray is not strictly a photographic
technology, it becomes visible when recorded on photographic ﬁlm,
and all manner of surgical procedures now depend on introducing
microcameras, endoscopes, and the like into the body.
If the restraints on commercial culture and surveillance might seem
beneﬁcial effects resulting from the restriction on photography, the
consequences of the imageless society for medicine seem altogether
less desirable.
9

Forgetting photography

Advertising – unquestionably one of the central roles for
photography in capitalist society – presents a different case, since
commodities can be hyped with words or drawings. The rise of
modern commodity culture, once again, though, seems to have
developed in tandem with photographic reproducibility. In part,
this is to do with the ability to disseminate images through the mass
media. But the characteristic of the photographic image clearly has
something to do with the power of advertising: the celebration
of commodities seems to thrive on the kind of high-resolution,
high-key, glossy image provided by photographs. With no
celebrities staring from the tabloids and limited advertising, the
imageless future has some things to recommend it!

The inhabitants of this future would, no doubt, miss some types of
photograph much more than others: some of these pictures seem
indispensable, others burdensome. Overall, in their absence the
world would seem less busy and probably more alien.
At this point, let’s put the time machine into reverse gear and travel
back to the mid-19th century: the point at which photography was
beginning to colonize the image culture of capitalist society. In
1864, Dr Hugh Diamond – editor of The Photographic Journal, and
pioneer photographer of mental illness – wrote the report on the
International Exhibition of 1862. In this assessment of the state of
photography, he claimed there was ‘scarce a branch of art, of
10

11

science, of economics, or indeed of human interest in its widest
application, in which the applications of this art [photography]
have not been made useful’. In medical science, he said, it was used
in ‘morbid anatomy of malformation and disease generally’ as well
as recording ‘the progress of cases and illustration of surgical
treatment’. It was employed in ethnological science and natural
history where ‘no other mode of delineation’ could compare with it,
and it provided an essential service in ‘giving a permanent form to
the enlarged images of the microscope’. ‘The archaeologist and
antiquary, the virtuoso and historian’ all used photographs, while
for ‘the architect and engineer it supersedes and far surpasses in
many cases drawings made by hand’. Photography had an
important place in law: reproducing documents and ‘pursuing the
criminal’. For manufacturers, it ‘depicted designs, patterns or
workmanship’. And lastly, Diamond claimed, ‘more ambitious still,
as if the globe were too narrow a sphere for its resources, it travels
into space, seeking and taking records of the phases of other worlds,
and of that great body, the sun . . . .’. When he claimed that
photography ventured into space, he meant this metaphorically by
being attached to the lens of a telescope: now cameras are ﬁxed to
space probes and beam back startling images of Saturn’s rings.
Mid-19th-century photographers and their champions often wrote
lists like this in a celebratory vein (in part, we suspect, because their
professional status was not that secure), but they were not wrong in
observing the rapid spread of their images through society. Since
Diamond’s day, the uses of photography have only proliferated. As
the critic and curator John Szarkowski noted in 1976, there are now
more photographs than there are bricks. Each one of them, he said,
was unique. Accounting for this number of images and their uses is
not an easy task.

Documents and pictures
This chapter and the one that follows examine a central division in
photography – that between ‘documents’ and ‘pictures’, or, to put it
another way, between ‘documentary’ and ‘art-photography’. All of
these terms are problematic, but the distinction is real and has
generated much of the photography we routinely encounter. The
photographic document, like other kinds of document, is typically
perceived to be a neutral, styleless, and objective record of
information. The document is usually thought to be devoid of
subjective intention, even of human will – it is frequently claimed
that the camera produces images automatically, as if unaided by an
operator. For instance, a French caricature from 1840 makes
fun of a photographer dozing while his apparatus does all the work.
Photographic art, in contrast, lays claim to intention, subjective
expression, spiritual uplift, and aesthetic effect. Rather than snooze,
photographic artists must be alert.
Some commentators have argued that a serious study of
photography should abjure any consideration of art and focus on
the instrumental forms and mass practices that are the mainstay of
the medium. Photographic art, it is suggested, is an invented
tradition, or ideology, and we would do better to look at the tasks
photography performs in modern society. This is a strong
12

argument; not least because the standard histories of photography
have, all too often, focused on art at the expense of mass image
forms: advertising, legal documents, pornography, anthropological
images, topographic views, and so forth. However, there are two
good reasons for continuing to study art-photography. Firstly, the
early pioneers of photography drew many of their key terms from
established conceptions of art: ‘photogenic drawing’, ‘picturesque
views’, ‘prints’, and so on.
The language of art was available to photography’s ﬁrst viewers; it
shaped what could be imagined and what could be done. The effects

Amusant, 6 September 1856

Photography

of these initial musings have had long-term consequences for our
understanding of photographs. Secondly – and this follows on
from the previous point – the document and the art-photograph
are locked together: these are mutually determining categories
that draw a great deal of their meanings from their antithetical
relation.
In the history of images, one category of representation has typically
been set against the high-ﬂown practices of art and cast in the role
of lowly carrier of information. To take just a couple of random
examples: during the 16th century, the art of northern Europe was
seen as descriptive and realistic, in contrast to the learned painting
practised in Italy; in the 18th century, the topographic view
(supposedly a literal description of place) was cast against the
sublime or picturesque landscape. In recent times, photography
(truth or record) has been opposed to painting (emotion or
expression). This distinction is reiterated within photography
itself: documents are set against pictures. In all of these
oppositions, the representational underling is viewed as descriptive
and ‘matter-of-fact’.
Most of these oppositions have their roots in the distinction
between the ‘liberal’ and the ‘mechanical arts’, which was enshrined
during the Renaissance of the 15th century. Renaissance artists
engaged in a protracted struggle to raise the status of their work
and their social standing. That is to say, painters sought to
distinguish themselves from wheelwrights, barrel-makers, and
others with whom they were frequently classed. To do this they
insisted that their work was a liberal art and not a lowly artisanal
(or mechanical) trade. Artisanal labour was viewed by the elite as
demeaning. Those who worked with their hands – displaying ‘mere’
skill, facility, or imitation – were said to be ‘servile’, because they
followed a plan established by others rather than demonstrating
their own ingenuity. In contrast to the artisan, the liberal
gentleman, who wrote poetry or engaged in geometry, was thought
to display learning and intellect and, as such, was said to be
14

untouched by the stain of work. Artists responded to this argument
by attempting to infuse their work with the explicit signs of mental
effort: this involved appeals to classical learning, the creation of
idealized ﬁgures that were not copies of imperfect nature, and
characterizing line and drawing as more foundational than mere
colouristic effects.
A decisive turning point in artists’ protracted struggle over status
occurred with the establishment of the Académie Royale de
Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris in 1648, and then the Royal
Academy in London in 1768. The painter-theorists who directed
these institutions – Gerard Lebrun and Sir Joshua Reynolds,
respectively – established Academic rules and precedents designed
to assert the intellectual content of their work and raise the
standing of art. Here is Reynolds:

employed in it, or the mental pleasure produced by it. As this
principle is observed or neglected, our profession becomes either a
liberal art, or a mechanical trade. In the hands of one man it makes
the highest pretensions, as it is addressed to the noblest faculties: in
those of another it is reduced to a mere matter of ornament; and the
painter has but humble province of furnishing our apartments with
elegance.

According to Academicians, any art based on copying endangered
the practice by proximity to the characteristics associated with the
artisan or ‘rude mechanic’. In this Academic tradition, the presence
of detail, because it suggested copying, had to be avoided at all costs.
In contrast, Academic art stressed broad or general effects and
idealized forms. Art was characterized by its distance from the
contingent features of the actual world and in this way signiﬁed the
presence of an active intelligence. In Reynolds’s argument, art and
work stand as mutually determining terms: art is noble and
elevated, while work is vulgar and base; the artist is a free subject in
contrast to the subjected worker.

Photography

During the 19th century, the Academic tradition was transformed –
in Britain by the popularity of genre painting and ‘Naturalism’, in
France by Realism and Impressionism. Nevertheless, many of the
structuring oppositions from the Academic tradition remained in
place. Copying or imitation continued to be viewed as mindless and
mechanical, while invention and idealization were highly valued.
Photography took its place within the established cultural
antimonies.
In an important essay written in 1857, Lady Elizabeth Eastlake
suggested that what photography did best ‘was beneath the doing
of a real artist’. Photography made exact copies of things: it saved
artists’ effort, labour, and time, and it freed them to concentrate on
imaginative or creative work. Those who wanted to dismiss this
new image-form argued that it was just a mindless, automatic
means of copying. But art-photographers also repeatedly echoed
this distinction, arguing that it was necessary to wrench
photography away from the automatic imprint of the apparatus,
to imbue it with intellectual characteristics; to reject details,
copies, and documents. Within photography itself, then, the same
division evident in the Academic tradition was reiterated:
documents were seen as objective, mechanical copies
characterized by superabundance of detail and practical utility; artphotography aspired to the status of invention and subjectivity.
This opposition generated some of the most signiﬁcant functions of
photography.

Objectivity
Photographic documents are central to our culture and we all have
a sense of what they look like and what they do. We use pictures like
this all the time. As I noted in the preceding chapter, a great deal of
our information about our world comes from these images, and all
manner of specialist professions employ photographic documents
in their work. Despite the evident importance of the document,
however, there has been remarkably little critical attention paid to
16

it. The exception is Molly Nesbit’s account of the photographs made
by Eugène Atget at the turn of the 20th century.
Atget was not an artist, he made images of Paris for others to use,
particularly some of those engaged in the skilled Parisian trades:
theatrical designers, metal workers, illustrators, and those who
worked off nostalgia for ‘old Paris’. He didn’t claim anything special
for these images. When the Surrealists wanted to publish one of his

Documents

17

Photography

pictures in their magazine, he declined any credit, adding ‘These are
simply documents I make’. Nesbit describes Atget’s document as a
‘nonaesthetic’, workaday form, with two key features: ﬁrstly, it is a
practical, utilitarian image; secondly, it is built on ‘openness’. The
document is always deﬁned by its viewer, who brings his or her
specialist requirements to it. For those who employed Atget’s
images, aesthetic signiﬁcance was of little or no relevance.
Information, content, detail, and use are what count in documents.
According to Nesbit, ‘an architectural photograph would be called a
document, as would a chronophotograph, a police i.d., or an X ray’.
The document, then, had no absolute form: the same image might
be used by different specialists, and so it had to be open to
interpretation. Atget was skilled in creating images that served
several constituencies.
However, some key characteristics of the document had been
established well before Atget. Historians of science have recently
paid considerable attention to investigating the category of
‘objectivity’ – a key concept in the functioning of the photographic
document and in other documentary media. Common sense
suggests that objectivity is a self-evident part in the toolbox of
science and other specialist forms of observation (the news media
typically claim objectivity). However, historical scrutiny suggests
that objectivity emerged as a component part of the new
subjectivity for observers during the 18th and 19th centuries. We are
all familiar with this conception of subjectivity from popular
representations of the scientist: this is not the wild-eyed genius on a
bad hair day, but the white-coated, emotionless, super-logical
analyst.
The modern conception of objectivity began to take root as a
response to the capitalist division of labour, which fragmented work
and knowledge into increasingly specialized portions. Some
intellectuals responded to the challenge of specialization by
adopting the values of detachment, disinterestedness, and selfeffacement, thereby asserting a stance seemingly outside particular
18

interests. This conception of objectivity entails eradicating all traces
of the observer, which are seen to interfere with the process of
recording data. This point of view presents observation as an
activity independent of actual observers and their personal
investments.

Photography, and in particular the photographic document, slotted
neatly into this new vision of objective observation. Throughout its
history, the camera has repeatedly been seen as an objective
machine that captures information without any interference from
the artist. We have already heard the sleeping photographer joke; in
the early years of photography this was an often repeated theme: it
was assumed that the sun made the picture, or the camera did, or
even that the object in question depicted itself (Talbot spoke of his
country pile, Lacock Abbey, as the ﬁrst building ‘that was ever yet
known to have drawn its own picture’). In each variant, the image
emerges without any conscious involvement by the photographer.
In this story, the camera ﬁgures as a model worker who never tires
or loses attention, doesn’t demand more wages or go on strike. The
document is, in its essentials, an objective form, which is deemed
truthful because it seems to be independent of the values of actual
19

Documents

The long-standing tussle between scientiﬁc investigators and their
illustrators offers one clear example of this process. Before
photography, documents were obtained for scientists (or natural
philosophers as they were called) from artists, but the men of
science often disagreed with draughtsmen about what could be seen
and how it should be depicted. The men of science opposed, what
they saw as, the personal vision and aesthetic preferences of artists.
When the French Interior Minister announced the invention of
photography to the Chamber of Deputies in 1839, he noted that it
would enable the traveller, archaeologist, and naturalist ‘to note
what they see, without having recourse to the hand of another’;
similarly, William Henry Fox Talbot – the English scientist credited
with the discovery of photography – dreamed of an automatic
apparatus that would do away with his dependence on artistic skill.

observers. In this light, photographs can seem neutral witnesses to
events.

Self/Other
The document was plain and artless; it was designed to be
transparent so the viewer could look through its surface and
concentrate on the things depicted. In the production of documents
the camera is usually located in a frontal, straight-on position,
providing as much detail as possible; the subject frequently ﬁlls the
frame. Honoré Daumier’s Parisian Sketch of 1853 presents an
anatomy of this form.

Daumier depicts two different Parisians and the way they
comport themselves for the camera. The ‘natural man’ faces
squarely up and stares into the lens – the resulting image will be

direct and unadorned. ‘Civilized man’, in contrast, adopts an
artfully contorted position and gazes thoughtfully into space; his
stance requires the support of the draped table. The image – all
fancy pose and deep shadow – is designed to convey dreamy
reﬂection and sensitivity. It is, of course, a good joke about Parisian
types – the no-nonsense, brutish bourgeois and his affected, artistic
cousin – but it is also an excellent rendering of the difference
between documents and pictures. Once again, these images assume
their characteristic meanings through their contrast.

As John Tagg and others have argued during the second half of the
19th century, through depicting ‘abnormal’ cases, or those viewed as
deviant – criminals, the sick, working people, colonial subjects, and
so on – photography contributed to the deﬁnition of those who
society classed respectable and normal. In the new intellectual
disciplines and practices that developed during this period –
psychiatry, anthropology, and others – the photograph was
employed to identify and deﬁne new objects of knowledge; to
categorize new specimens. One recent author, preparing a study of
photographs made in Africa between 1840 and 1918, observed that
his search for images led him not into art museums, but to
museums of science, the archives of governmental ministries,
professional societies, and former colonial companies.
21

Documents

Photographic documents have been employed to do many things,
but it is instructive to turn brieﬂy to the second half of the 19th
century, when they were increasingly put to work by a wide range of
state institutions and private organizations. In each case, the
photograph was thought to produce an objective record, rather than
an interpretation, or presentation, of information. One reason that
this focus is useful is that it draws out the extent to which
photographs depend for their meanings on networks of authority.
The image supplies little in itself. What counts is its use and the
power to ﬁx a particular interpretation of the events, objects, or
people depicted. Some people, and especially some institutions,
have much more clout in this process than others do.

Photography

This process of investigation was built on a hierarchical vision,
because in each case the person with the camera had the social
authority, or money, to arrange and pose others for scrutiny: the
photographer John Thompson, for instance, noted in 1873 the
‘triﬂing sums’ that he paid to poor Chinese people for ‘the privilege
of taking such subjects’. Some people were authorized to look;
others were looked down upon. The pictures made of medical
bodies, criminals, colonial subjects, and slum dwellers were never
intended for the gaze of those who appeared in the photographs;
they were designed to receive the attention of ‘specialists’. Typically,
these photographs were made in one place – the place where people
of this kind were to be found – but circulated in metropolitan
centres, in government departments, law courts, or professional
institutions. Under these conditions, to be seen and pictured is to be
caught up in the deﬁnitions of others deemed more expert or
authoritative. The archives of photographs produced at this time
were, in the ﬁrst instance, subject to this kind of specialist,
authorized attention. The images of the sick body were studied by
medical students and surgeons; those of prisoners by detectives.
Nevertheless, these archives seeped into wider circulation. For
instance, the images made by Dr Hugh Diamond of female inmates
under his supervision at the Springﬁeld asylum were issued as
lithographic illustrations in John Conolly’s book The Physiognomy
of Insanity in 1858.
Let me brieﬂy examine a few examples from, what Tagg calls,
these ‘archives of subjection’. As I noted in the preceding chapter,
before the advent of photography police identiﬁcation of suspects or
repeat offenders relied upon eye-witness description and memory.
Fingerprints emerged as a means of identiﬁcation only during the
late 19th century. When ﬁngerprinting was combined with
photographs, a powerful new technology of identiﬁcation and
surveillance came into being. (We tend not to pay much attention to
the ﬁling cabinet, but it played a signiﬁcant role in this new system.)
Perhaps surprisingly, some time passed before photography was
systematically employed by the police and prison network. Early
22

photographic documents of British prisoners reveal lack of
standardization: frequently men and women appear in their own
clothes; there is neither regulated camera distance or position, nor
any systematic pose; sometimes the images are presented in
ornamental frames. Surprisingly from our perspective, initial prison
photography was modelled on the middle-class portrait. When
police photography really took off in the 1870s, it was much more
regulated, with standard poses, camera positions, and so on. The
documents produced were intended for comparison and
differentiation.

23

Documents

However, there were two distinct tendencies involved at the time;
the ‘police archive’ was torn between these rival models. On the one
hand, was the idea of the ‘criminal type’, supposedly predetermined
to offend against the law by his or her wicked nature. In this vision,
the criminal was a kind of degenerate biological category.
As Allan Sekula and others have shown proponents of this
conception adhered to a ‘physiognomic’ model – the belief that
interior mental states, or personality traits, are manifest in the
characteristics of the body. Advocates of this pseudo-science
attempted to produce images that would reveal innate criminal
characteristics; photography was an obvious resource for this
approach. In his book L’Uomo delinquente of 1876, Cesare
Lombroso produced a range of portraits purportedly showing
criminal types; more elaborately, during the 1880s, Francis Galton
developed a technique of exposing multiple portrait negatives to
form one image so that shared characteristics came through to give,
what he claimed, was a physiognomic likeness of the inherent
criminal type. At the opposite extreme to this generalizing trend
was a particularizing vision, which sought to individuate criminals.
This approach, identiﬁed with Alphonse Bertillon, who directed the
identiﬁcation service of the Parisian Préfecture de Police from 1882,
produced records of individuals that combined numerous
photographic details of the body with careful measurements of the
ears, the length and width of the nose, the distance between the
eyes, and so forth. In both approaches, the photograph traces the

Photography

marks of the body that would be used to identify and discipline
those who offended against the existing norms of behaviour.
My other example of photography in the service of professional
authority is drawn from the encounter between Western colonizers
and the colonized peoples. The photographic document was one
means through which the colonial powers envisaged their
difference from their colonized subjects. These images originate
from various sources: from the personnel attached to the colonial
departments, missionaries, individuals working for colonial
companies, and military ofﬁcers. Anthropology, institutionalized
during the 1840s, became increasingly concerned with
photographic documentation during the 1870s. During this period,
images of the colonial Other are overwhelmingly predicated on an
idea of essential racial difference and a concomitant vision of racial
superiority. Some observers were undoubtedly attracted to the way
of life they recorded, which they imagined to be less repressed than
Western society, but a basic hierarchy held.
Two different tendencies can also be discerned in the colonial
archive. The ﬁrst is based on a comparative method and follows
some of the themes we saw in the police vision. This view, which
was again physiognomic, saw the traces of racial difference on the
body: cultural difference was here reduced to physical distinction
(which was itself petriﬁed and over-generalized). Photography
played an important role in collecting images of different ‘races’,
which could be anatomically compared and contrasted. In 1869,
John Lamprey systematized this comparative approach by
photographing the body against a gridded ground and establishing
rules for camera distance, angle, and so on.
This method was designed to enhance comparison of the various
specimens. Despite the seeming objectivity of this project, it was
steeped in colonial ideology and illicit desire. The naked body of the
colonized subject was scrutinized and displayed in a manner that
would have been deemed entirely inappropriate for that of its
24

colonialist counterpart. The images collected in this way were
employed to sort and sift humanity – at the far end of this process
lies ‘race theory’, genocide, and various forms of ‘ethnic cleansing’.
The second tendency involved projecting the fantasy of an
ethnographic Other thought to be outside of modern society, indeed
outside of time. The culture of the colonized was thought to be
locked in an eternal past and deemed incapable of change or
dynamic transformation. There are plenty of examples of this kind
of ethnographic photograph: African farmers posed for a hunt;
people stripped of modern Western dress and arranged in
traditional costume, and so on. Similarly, postcards circulating from
colonial Algeria in the early 20th century purport to depict that
which they could not possibly show: the closed space of the harem.
In photographs of this second type, colonial fantasy mirrors itself –
the image embodies the observer’s imaginary conceptions rather
than any external conditions. Photography was employed from the
later 19th century in a wide variety of archives, and each was subject
25

to the authority of a new type of observer: a professional middleclass expert who lived by (usually) his claims to education, specialist
knowledge, and trained, objective vision.

Photography

Documentary
Left like this, the document appears as an invidious image that
serves powerful interests. But, as we saw earlier, documents are, by
deﬁnition, open to diverse interpretations and uses. The ‘archives of
subjection’ embody one kind of institutional use for documents. But
other people and other institutions have cast them in other roles.
We need to approach this subject with some sense of the
contradictory possibilities in play, particularly as the document was
transformed into documentary. The term ‘documentary’ was
probably ﬁrst used by John Grierson in 1926. Grierson wrote that
Robert Flaherty’s ethnographic ﬁlm Moana, ‘being a visual account
of the events in the daily life of a Polynesian youth and his family,
has documentary value’. (He was to become a central ﬁgure in
organizing and promoting the ﬁlm movement he described.)
Documentary is an incredibly elastic category – perhaps even more
so than ‘document’ – which is frequently used to describe war
photography, photojournalism, forms of social investigation, and
more open-ended projects of observation. It covers commissioned
work (for newspapers, magazines, or books); pictures taken without
direct commission, but that subsequently appear in some
commercial format; and consciously planned books or exhibitions.
It is not uncommon to ﬁnd a picture made in one context migrating
to another: say, a photograph by Weeyee made for a news story
appearing in an exhibition, or a book representing his work
as a photographer who has been awarded the status of
auteur. It can seem very difﬁcult to establish any common link
connecting these disparate activities under the collective heading of
‘documentary’.
Nevertheless, we can detect some characteristic features that unite
seemingly diverse documentary photographs. One approach to this
26

There is another approach to documentary, though, which seems
more defensible and more interesting. The art-photographer Ansel
Adams criticized what is probably the most famous documentary
project, the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration,
which produced 270,000 photographs of American society between
1935 and 1943. Adams claimed that those working for the FSA
(including, among others, Arthur Rothstein, Dorothea Lange, and
27

Documents

problem, and it has been a prominent one, claims that
documentary, in all its forms, entails an objective, unmediated
record of facts. Documentary is said to provide its viewers with
direct access to truth. In his pioneering book on the subject,
William Stott stated: ‘[t]he heart of documentary is not form or
style or medium, but always content’. As we have seen, this is an
argument rooted in the idea of the mechanical arts and the related
conception of a detached observer. Most often, this approach is
predicated on a range of negative injunctions: no colour (black and
white); no cropping; no retouching; no posing, staging, or
introducing extraneous objects; no additional lighting or dramatic
light effects. What is left unsaid in this account is that some
institutions or powerful individuals have the resources and
authority to decide what counts as true or objective. As Tagg noted,
if a photograph of the Loch Ness monster is to count as evidence for
its existence it matters whether it was made by a private enthusiast
or by the military. The site of its circulation matters just as much.
In practice, the truth content of images is always open to dispute
and can be challenged by contending interests. To take only one
well-known example: in 1936, the American photographer Arthur
Rothstein moved a sun-bleached steer’s skull from a patch of grass
to cracked and parched soil, thus creating an iconic image of the
effect of draught on small farmers. When this shift of site emerged
there was a conservative outcry. This was not an objective record,
the critics said, but an image that had been tampered with or set up
– it was not a documentary record, but ‘propaganda’. In this
instance, the presence of the photographer was deemed to
disqualify the ‘content’ of the image.

Walker Evans) where ‘not photographers’ but ‘a bunch of
sociologists with cameras’. There is a point here: the two central
subjects of documentary are war reportage and social investigation.
Evans himself outlined, for his boss at the FSA, an itinerary for a
trip through the Southern States of America in 1935:
Still photography, of general sociological nature.
First objective, Pittsburgh and vicinity, one week; photography,
documentary in style, of industrial subjects, emphasis on housing
and home life of working-class people. Graphic records of a

complete, complex, pictorially rich modern industrial center . . . .

It is important to grasp that Adams was committed to artphotography as a form of self-expression: for him, signiﬁcant
photography involved the production of pictures, not mere records
or documents. In one sense, Evans echoes this perception, referring
to photography of a ‘sociological nature’, but there are other
features from his itinerary that suggest another conception:
‘graphic records’ and, crucially, ‘documentary in style’. The latter
idea represents an early articulation of a distinction that Evans
returned to during the 1970s, when he stressed the difference
between ‘documentary’ and what he termed ‘documentary style’.
Documentary, he said, was not a very clear idea because ‘an example
of a literal document would be a police photograph of a murder
scene’. What Evans, and those others we would label documentary
photographers, did was work in a ‘documentary style’. Evans’s
distinction is not quite as secure as he maintained, but it draws
attention to an important point. Documentary photography is an
aesthetic mode or a style. Often the champions of documentary
deny this, claiming their work is styleless, objective, and direct.
Nevertheless, this work is always an approach to photography; a
mode of representation predicated on the form of the document.
This style is characterized by two closely related factors: antisubjectivism and a gaze that looks outward to the world. (In his
way, Adams registered this, but he was committed to the inward
28

and the subjective.) Seen in this fashion, documentary
seems more interesting and more defensible.

Technologies
In an important sense, documentary as we know it only really
emerged in the later 1920s and 1930s. When Roger Fenton
produced his photographic record of the Crimean War in 1855,
the images he made consisted of posed portraits or immobile
scenes.

7. Roger Fenton, The Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855
29

Documents

There are no dead or wounded bodies among his images and no
photographs of ‘action’. Fenton’s most famous photograph – The
Valley of the Shadow of Death – depicts a rough track strewn with
cannon balls, but no other signs of human presence. Ten years later,
a lot more corpses are evident in the photographs from the
American Civil War. But it was more than 50 years before
photographers could really depict dynamic action. For instance,

Robert Capa’s photographs of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 puts
the viewer right in the thick of events. His Death of a Loyalist
Soldier apparently captures the instant of this man’s death and is
taken a matter of yards from the event.

Photography

Capa’s most famous dictum was ‘[i]f your pictures aren’t good
enough, you aren’t close enough’. The British authorities were
concerned to ensure that Fenton did not record anything that would
be bad for morale, but even had he wished, he could not in fact have
made a photograph like Death of a Loyalist Soldier. Fenton worked
with a heavy, large-format camera that required a tripod, resulting
in a static point of view. What is more, the wet-collodion glass plates
he used required rapid processing once exposed before they dried
(he took a darkroom mounted on a horse-drawn wagon with him
into the ﬁeld). His technology almost guaranteed a ﬁxed and formal
image.
Some transformations in photographic technology occurred in
the intervening period, but the key changes took place from the
mid-1920s. From this period, small lightweight cameras with good

Fenton’s images provided the basis for engravings in the press. This
was a laborious process, taking one or more engravers days to
produce a plate from the original image. The images also appeared
in limited deluxe folio editions after his return from the war. His
material was neither rapidly nor widely disseminated. Capa’s
photographs, in contrast, soon appeared in magazines and papers
across the world. Another technical transformation had made this
possible. Before the 1880s, it was not commercially feasible to
reproduce photographs and type on the same page. Photo-printing
systems were available a decade earlier, but the half-tone screen,
developed during the 1880s in Europe and the USA, came to
dominate newspaper and magazine reproduction until the
31

lenses became available. At this point, many photographers began
to use an Ermanox, a small-format plate camera, which could be
held under certain conditions. Although its use did not become
widespread until the 1940s, the key change came with the creation
of the Leica camera, originally created to test exposure times for
movie ﬁlm. The Leica transformed possibilities in photojournalism.
Firstly, it utilized 35-millimetre movie ﬁlm in small metal canisters;
this considerably reduced camera size and meant that the
photographer could carry and expose a large number of frames with
minimal time elapsing between them. (Some photographers
working today expose 300 or 400 frames a day.) Secondly, the small
format enabled photographers to work in a mobile, ﬂuid way with
the camera held at eye level (itself an innovation – prior to this time
most cameras were positioned lower). At the end of the 1920s,
ﬂashbulbs were introduced, allowing work in poor light conditions
(ﬂash photography had previously involved combustible
magnesium powder in a dish – a ﬂash in the pan – resulting in
an intense burst of light and dense smoke). Photographers could
now photograph events from the inside and often went unobserved.
The number of frames possible also meant that a premium was
no longer placed on getting everything right in advance, since the
best image could be selected later from among the numerous
exposures.

introduction of digital technology a century later. Half-tone screens
are made by interposing a sheet of glass marked with a grid between
a photographic negative and a zinc plate rendered sensitive to light.
In this process, a photograph is transformed into an image
composed of numerous dots in various sizes, which can then be
printed in ink, allowing it to be combined with type. This system
created the conditions for photography’s emergence as a massimage form. It was, however, slow to catch on, partially, at least,
because hand-engraved images continued to signify quality. The
press employed photographs on a regular basis only from the
beginning of the 20th century. The ﬁrst paper that was illustrated
throughout with photographs, The Daily Mirror, appeared in 1904.
When photomechanical printing did become widespread, it
reinforced the seemingly agentless ‘objectivity’ of the press.
It was during the later 1920s and 1930s that the important mass
photo-magazines predicated on a new educated, urban audience
appeared. These were publications structured around photographic
stories that covered topical news events and everyday life. In 1935, it
became possible to send photographs by telegraph, images taken a
great distance away could then be sent to the home publication and
printed more-or-less simultaneously with the events they depicted.
These magazines became one of the most important cultural forms
of the 20th century. Many of the central innovations in the photomagazines arose in Germany. By 1928, the Berliner Illustierte
Zietung sold 2.2 million copies. The Nazi takeover of the country in
1933 had the effect of dispersing key editors, photographers, and
layout specialists throughout the world. In 1936, the American
publication Life appeared, selling nearly half a million copies. At the
end of 1938, Picture Post was launched in Britain (with refugees
from Hitler prominent among the staff ). The French photo
magazine VU commenced publication in 1928, and Paris-Match
was launched in 1949. USSR in Construction (in three languages),
published from the late 1920s, embodied a Stalinist vision of
socialism in one country, while employing iconic images and a
dynamic layout. Arbeiter Illustierte Zeitung, a picture magazine
32

allied to the German Communist Party, which regularly featured
photomontages by John Heartﬁeld, along with investigative
photojournalism, reached a circulation of half a million. After
Hitler came to power it was published outside Germany and
clandestinely smuggled into the country. In 1951, Drum appeared in
South Africa: this was an important magazine that employed black
writers and photographers and which was extensively read by a
black urban audience. It is said that, after the Cuban revolution,
Fidel Castro declared he wanted something similar to Life, and
Revolución was born.
The documenting photography that appeared in these magazines
was frequently infused with a sheer sense of visual wonder. The
editorial in the ﬁrst issue of Life declared that its aim was to enable
its audience:

the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange
things . . . to see and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed;
to see and be instructed.

In an important sense, despite the differences in the ideology of the
photo-magazines, this editorial provides a programmatic statement
for the new documentary work that emerged in the 1920s and
1930s. Documentary photographers put the new technologies to
work in recording things that had not previously been depicted.
This tendency was particularly evident in the early picture
magazines’ fascination with the ﬁrst published image of this or that.
Picture Post, for example, might feature ‘the ﬁrst full picture story of
an operation’, or ‘the only photograph ever taken inside the high
court’.
Much documentary photography, especially between the world
wars, was conceived as a poetic form. (Grierson saw documentary in
this way: the ﬁlm Night Mail, which he produced in 1936, had a
score by Benjamin Britten and a commentary by the poet

W. H. Auden.) Many key documentary photographers – including
Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Humphrey Spender, Brassaı̈,
and André Kertész – thought of their work as a new kind of poetry.
In this manner, much documentary photography combined a
campaigning vision with an aesthetic of the everyday. In part, at
least, this conception stems from the emergence of documentary
photography alongside Surrealism. Documentary photographers
were interested in ﬁnding the extraordinary in ordinary life. Rather
than high-ﬂown subjects, the vision focused on the way shadows fall
on empty coffee cups, life on the streets of the modern city, or the
oddities associated with popular leisure. Themes from everyday life
played a particularly central role in the documentary vision before
the mass commercialization of popular culture, which really took
hold, if unevenly, after World War II.
For the best part of 50 years, these magazines, and many others
like them, were a feature of the cultural landscape, providing
outlets for investigative photojournalism and documentary. Some
have suggested that television killed the photo-magazine. However,
what seems to have been more particularly responsible for their
demise was the spread of commercial television, which stripped
them of advertising revenue. By the 1970s (France seems to have
been an exception), these magazines had been replaced by the
Sunday supplements, more or less entirely geared for
advertisements.

Subjected
Documentary has always been closely linked to the study of social
class. During the 1970s and 1980s, documentary was interrogated
by both practising photographers and critics. Two overlapping
themes emerged. One component developed from a reconsideration
of 19th-century photographers who were seen as important ﬁgures
in the pre-history of documentary: ﬁgures such as Thomas Annan,
who depicted slum conditions in Glasgow in the 1860s; John
Thompson, responsible for images of London street life in the
34

The wilds of Lancashire or the mysteries of the East End were as
little explored as the cannibal interior of the New Hebrides, or the
head hunter hinterland of Borneo. . . . In particular, my experience
living among cannibals in the New Hebrides . . . taught me the many
points in common between these wild looking, fuzzy haired, black
smelly people and our own, so when I came home from that
expedition I determined to apply the same methods here in Britain.

There is a palpable distance here between ‘us’ and ‘them’. There are
lots of examples of this kind, which suggest that documentary
photography might be understood as a kind of reconnaissance
operation generating intelligence on people who had previously
escaped ofﬁcial attention.

Documents

1870s; and Jacob Riis, who, during the 1880s and 1890s, produced
an extensive body of photographs of working-class ‘slum dwellers’
in New York. The same physiognomic ideas we encountered
earlier were applied to the study of working people. In a period
when the city was rigidly zoned by class, social investigators saw
it as their mission to illustrate the lives and habits of working
people and to reveal the threat they posed to the health and
welfare of nation and empire. Photography proved an important
tool in this process. Working people – often referred to at the
time by social investigators as ‘slum dwellers’, or ‘the poor’ –
where represented by these photographers as a problem (almost
as a race apart), requiring regulation by those in authority. Riis
exhibited his pictures in various formats, including magic lantern
displays for the New York elite, dramatizing the menace
represented by this unseen urban horde. As I have suggested, this
critique of photography in social investigation was extended to
mainstream documentary photography, and there are plenty of
reasons for doing so. Before instigating the documentary ‘MassObservation’ project, called ‘Worktown’, dedicated to the study of
people in the North of England in the 1930s, Tom Harrison had
been working as an anthropologist. He drew a direct comparison
between the two forms of observation, noting:

Photography

The second aspect of this critique focused on the ‘humanism’ and
universal assumptions embodied in the documentary style. While
documentary photography displayed a generalized sympathy for
‘the people’ and often took the poor and the destitute for its
subjects, it was argued that it tended to submerge obscure real
differences, particularly differences in power, between social
classes. Documentary purveyed a generalized sympathy for the poor
and downtrodden, but it offered precious little in the way of analysis
or critique; only rarely did it draw to light the structures sustaining
these manifest inequalities. It focused on the visible signs of
poverty – ragged clothes, dirty children, crumbling houses – and did
little to highlight the causes. The same criticism is levelled today at
charity images. Indeed, the critics of documentary argued that this
was a condescending vision, akin to charity; it represented the
plight of the poor – whether in Western cities or rural Africa – so
that the powerful might act, but it did nothing to enable the people
depicted to represent themselves, or take control of their destiny. In
this sense, all too often documentary depicts people as passive
victims. At worst, the poor and destitute are photographed in order
to put the humanity of the photographer on display.
These are powerful criticisms of some key trends in documentary
photography, but they are not the whole picture and, in our cynical
age when a concern with documentary and class seems deeply
unfashionable, this argument appears overbearing; it homogenizes
diverse approaches and obscures some important and valuable
aspects of the documentary tradition.
One problem with the critique of the documentary mode is that it
risks over-emphasizing the image at the expense of its actual use.
What people make of documentary images does not necessarily
coincide with what they were intended for. The attention paid to
social class in documentary photography during the 1930s provided
an impetus for a wide-ranging discourse about the condition of
society: this debate contained different voices, including those who
did not share the middle-class reform politics of documentary’s
36

protagonists. The depiction of the unemployed or the working poor
can be seen, in this sense, as just a starting point for a ﬁerce struggle
over deﬁnition. The outcome of that discussion is not
predetermined by the images themselves. John Roberts has
observed that the decline of documentary – or at least the plummet
in its prestige – has coincided very closely with a retreat from class
politics among the Western intelligentsia. Social class remains as
powerful a determinant on our lives as it ever was; indeed, all the
statistics suggest class distinctions have been entrenched over the
last 20 years, but they seem much less visible than they once were.
The absence of documentary attention is a contributing factor to
the current lack of debate on this issue.

In any state that will tolerate them, there are still plenty of
small agencies staffed by oppositional and committed
documentarists.
Documentary, in some of its forms, can be seen as an analytic vision
37

Documents

Alongside the intelligence agents, anthropologists, and
philanthropic reformers, there have also been many photographers
who have seen themselves as contesting ofﬁcial accounts of events.
To take just a few examples: in the early 20th century Lewis Hine
made photographs to be used in the campaign to end child labour in
American factories, mines, and sweatshops; during the 1920s and
1930s, Tina Modotti recorded the Mexican revolutionary struggle
from the inside – her pictures featured in the radical press; in
Britain during the 1930s, Edith Tudor-Hardt worked closely with
members of the National Unemployed Workers’ Association.
Documentary photographers in Latin America have played varied
and active roles in popular resistance, while Ernest Cole’s book
House of Bondage is undoubtedly one of the most powerful
condemnations in any medium of apartheid South Africa. Today,
whatever else may be said about their work, Susan Meiselas and
Sebastião Salgado see their pictures as contributing to the global
struggle for social justice.

capable of great critical acuity. The powers that be have long
understood this potential and have repeatedly censored
documentary images. In the case of dictatorial regimes, with a
vested interest in their nefarious deeds going unrecorded, this
should be obvious enough. But liberal-capitalist states also
(increasingly) attempt to police the circulation of documentary
photographs.
A few examples will serve to make the point. During the seven-year
occupation of Japan at the end of World War II, the US
administration banned the publication of any images relating to the
atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was only
after the US departure that Yosuke Yamahata, Ken Domon, and
Shomei Tomatsu were able to circulate their important
photographic record of these events. Despite an initially positive
response from the US government towards the recording of the
Vietnam War, which it saw as good publicity for the ﬁght against
communism, photojournalists played a signiﬁcant role in swinging
public opinion away from support for intervention. Larry Burrows,
David Douglas Duncan and Philip Jones Grifﬁths, Don McCullin,
38

and Tim Page all produced important photographic studies that
cast the conduct of the war in a starkly negative light. North
Vietnamese photographers Vo Anh Khanh, Minh Truong, Doan
Cong Tinh, and others, who worked under incredibly difﬁcult
conditions, also produced important documentary records of a
peasant army confronting a superpower. Among the many telling
photographs from this imperialist war, Eddie Adams’s image of a
Saigon chief of police summarily executing a communist suspect in
the street had an enormous impact on public opinion; so did the
pictures of the My Lai massacre, in which US soldiers killed men,
women, and children. The photographs of this atrocity were
smuggled out of Vietnam and circulated by the US army
photographer Ron Haeberle (one image became the basis for the
widely seen poster Q. And babies? A. and babies).

39

Documents

Governments now appear to have learned their lesson. During the
Falklands/Las Malvinas conﬂict in the early 1980s, the British
government allowed only ofﬁcial images to appear in the media;
in the recent invasion of Iraq, journalists and photographers
were ‘embedded’ with military units; while the US military has
subsequently sought to prevent the disclosure of ‘trophy’ images,
which reportedly depict the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, for fear that
they may be used as ‘propaganda’ by the enemies of the occupation;
they have also policed the publication of images of the American
casualties. Documentary photographs often display events that
some people would prefer remain unobserved; when they emerge,
these images can become the locus of widespread debate and
disagreement. The control of documentary photographs clearly still
matters.

Chapter 3
Pictures

To speak of photographic ‘art’ is fraught with problems, not least
because there are at least two, and possibly three, traditions out of
which this category has been put together. Firstly, there is ‘artphotography’, stemming from the 1860s, which involves
photographers making pictures that claim the status of art. This
tradition includes quite diverse tendencies stretching from ‘trick’
photography to the injunction against any manipulation; from soft
focus to technical precision; from subjectivism to objectivism.
Secondly, there are lots of examples of artists using photography
(though, as one colleague wryly noted, no one ever speaks of
‘photographers using art’). Thirdly, ‘street photography’ or ‘auteur
documentary’ is often grouped with art-photography. In an
important sense, the idea of an art of photography is an ‘invented
tradition’. Powerful institutions, curators, and collectors have
drawn images from contexts as diverse as campaigning publications
and scientiﬁc archives to weld together a tradition and, not
insigniﬁcantly, generate a commodity market. Attempts to knit this
material into some coherent garment tend to unravel, as different
contexts of use and value pull in different directions. Nevertheless,
in the last 25 years artists have become increasingly aware of the
histories of photography, and some of the most prominent artists
practising today – Jeff Wall or Thomas Struth – work exclusively in
photography. This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the
trends (and a few contradictions) in art-photography.
40

The 19th century

Photography indeed can invent, create, and compose as well as copy.
In fact, particularly in portraiture, the machine copies what the true
artist has invented, created, and composed, which could never have
been copied or represented if the photographer had not possessed
genius.

What is interesting here is the extent to which art – which for
Claudet entails invention, composition, and genius – is entwined
with the negative case of the document or copy. Throughout its
history, photographic art has been intimately connected with this
demonic twin: sometimes it has struggled to cast it off, and at others
it has entered into a pact with it. In both instances, however,
41

Pictures

As I suggested in the previous chapter, the language of art was
integral to photography from its inception in 1839; wealthy
amateurs dabbling with photography, for example, often modelled
their activity on print connoisseurs. Nevertheless, it was 20 years
before serious claims were made for an art of photography. These
claims coincided with the rise of a body of professional
photographers, and were articulated in meetings of their societies,
and appeared in their specialist publications. Photographers had to
ﬁght an uphill battle: the prevailing belief had it that photographs
emerged automatically from a soulless machine. The camera
produced documents not pictures. In both England and France, for
much of the 19th century, this was the prevailing legal view. The
law, when called upon to adjudicate on copyright, tended to assume
that the photographer was a passive attendant on an apparatus
(much like a worker) who could not be a copyright owner.
Copyright was often attributed to the commissioner of the picture
or owner of the property depicted; in some cases, photographers
were even denied the right to use their own negatives.
Photographers had to work hard against this conception. Here is
Antoine Claudet, a French photographer domiciled in England,
writing in 1861:

Photography

photographic art retains a determining relation to the idea of the
automatic copy, or objective document.
During the 19th century, art-photography meant, ﬁrst and
foremost, asserting the active presence of the photographer. The
dominant historical perspective on 19th-century photography has,
however, focused on the idea of a ‘new medium’; a proposition ﬁrst
advanced by Elizabeth Eastlake in 1857. The problem, though, is
that Eastlake’s suggestion is read anachronistically from the
perspective of the modernist aesthetics that held sway from the
1920s until, at least, the 1970s. Photography, modernists claimed,
represented a new way of looking at things – a ‘new vision’ – that
broke with traditional pictorial forms, creating new modes of
composition and offering new visual experiences. The new vision, or
camera vision, meant working with those characteristics that were
speciﬁc to the medium of photography. This argument suggests that
the camera shows things in a new and unique way: clear, precise,
without selecting; with novel framing effects and new vantage
points. This attitude underpins the idea that photography provided
the source for the unorthodox compositions of Impressionist
painter Edgar Degas, who, from the mid-1870s, often shifted the
principal subject to the edge of his pictures, sliced through ﬁgures,
adopted unusual points of view, and positioned objects between the
viewer and the focus of attention. However, the photographic effects
that are supposed to have inﬂuenced Degas really surface with the
amateur images produced at the end of the century; similarly,
Eastlake’s ‘new medium’ was not a new way of looking, but a rather
traditional one. For her, the photograph was not a work of art, but a
document that could be used by artists.
In fact, the kind of picture associated with Degas, with its empty
centre and lopped-off heads, would have seemed scandalous to
19th-century photographers, who took their models from the
mainstream paintings exhibited in Academy or Salon. Photographic
composition during this period featured integral ﬁgures and objects
positioned at the centre of the image; the framing edge of the
42

photograph bound the space into a coherent whole. In 1869, the
English photographer H. P. Robinson described how this kind of
picture would look. He claimed that in good photographic
composition:
the principal object, must come out into the strongest relief; the rest
must be subordinate; and thus we should obtain unity which is
necessary to pictorial effect.

In the main, photographers did not attempt to follow Academic
painters in creating imaginative scenes from the Bible or ancient
history (although some were prepared to have a go). As Robinson
put it, the painter could ‘imagine new worlds’ and depict ‘angels and
cherubim’ or the Last Judgement without offending taste. But, he
said, when ‘the photographer [ . . . ] attempts to do so, he holds his
art up to ridicule and contempt’.
Photographers, in the main, conﬁned themselves to the lower
genres of art: still lifes, moralized scenes from everyday life, artistic
portraiture, and picturesque views. Some, though, went further.
Oscar Rejlander, and then Robinson, developed a technique of
43

Pictures

In English Academic theory, the relation Robinson described was
known as ‘hierarchy’ and ‘subordination’. This conception assumed
that the most signiﬁcant ﬁgure or object should be rendered in
much greater detail than the rest of the picture, so that the viewer’s
attention would be directed to the compositional centre. Some
photographers attempted to use a differential focus to attain this
effect. In France, a little earlier than Robinson, the photographer
Gustave Le Gray articulated a comparable account based on a
‘theory of sacriﬁces’. Photographers followed Academic rules partly
because this was the version of the picture available to them, and
partly to distance themselves from the idea that they were mindless
and mechanical copyists. As with the document, deﬁnitions of
photographic pictures emerged from this long-running division
between the mechanical and the liberal arts.

Photography

‘combination printing’, in which a photograph was produced from
multiple negatives: Rejlander made his Two Ways of Life (1857)
from 30 separate negatives, while Robinson’s Bringing Home the
May (1862) was compiled from 9 negatives. This technique was
obviously a very difﬁcult process to master, requiring precise and
laborious work in the darkroom to disguise the joins. Combination
printing enabled Rejlander and Robinson to produce elaborate
compositions that followed the rules of art. The sheer effort
involved also allowed them to suggest that their pictures were
not mere copies, but the result of artistic skill, intelligence, and
culture. Many were unconvinced: the parts seemed to be lit
from different directions; shadows did not coincide with the
principal light source; the diverse ﬁgures, or the ﬁgures and the
mise en scène, did not seem to mesh together. One critic claimed
that Robinson’s pictures were more like ‘patchworks’ than artistic
compositions. Gradually, both Rejlander and Robinson abandoned
this technique, while continuing to produce elaborately staged
genre scenes.
Perhaps Julia Margaret Cameron pursued the idea of photographic
art more inventively than anyone else during this period. Her
pictures are much simpler, consisting of just a few ﬁgures artfully
posed against a vague background. However, what is really
distinctive about her work is that she employed an all-over soft
focus rather than highlighting the most signiﬁcant part of the image
(for this reason, the photographic establishment disliked her
pictures). But, in the end, Cameron’s work is not so different from
those around her; her subjects are drawn from the Academic
repertoire and she made full use of the dressing-up box.
Towards the end of the 19th century, there was a concerted effort to
establish photography as a creative art, which coalesced into the
international movement known as Pictorialism. An exhibition held
in 1891 by the Vienna Camera Club, with the express aim of
showing only artistic work, is usually seen as initiating this trend. In
its wake, a number of independent photo-associations developed in
44

Europe and North America as splinter groups from the established
societies. Unlike the existing groupings, Pictorialists, despite
differences, were single-mindedly dedicated to the cause of
art-photography.

Many of them sought out difﬁcult printing processes such as the
gum brichromate process, platinum print, or bromoil print. Though
not universally employed, the gum brichomate process is
symptomatic of this sensibility. This process was invented in 1858,
but was revived in the mid-1890s. To make an image, a paste
consisting of gum arabic, pigment, and potassium brichromate was
spread on paper; this was dried, placed in contact with a negative,
and exposed to light, thus darkening the brichromate that bound
the pigment. To bring the image out, the exposed paper coated in
the paste was simply washed with water, removing layers of
pigment. Using a brush or sponge, the photographer could
45

Pictures

The Pictorialists drew their subjects and compositional modes from
the existing pictorial arts. They were particularly attracted to the
hazy aesthetic effects of the artist James McNeil Whistler and to
fashionable Japanese prints. Pictorialist art was self-consciously
‘arty’. Photography is a process that allows for the production of
multiple images from the same negative. When prints are made by
hand, they inevitably vary somewhat, but, in principle, the same
image can be reproduced in large numbers. In contrast, Pictorialists
went to great lengths to produce unique, handcrafted pictures that
corresponded to established artistic models – ink or wash drawings
and etchings. To this end, often the negative was extensively
reworked with brush or pencil to suppress unwanted details,
change the balance of tones, add or remove highlights, and so on.
(Frank Eugene used an etching needle to literally scratch away the
details and features he did not want to appear in the ﬁnal print.)
The Pictorialists also adopted a soft-focus approach and worked to
suppress detail, frequently using lenses adjusted to this end; they
were drawn to atmospheric conditions that veiled the subject
(mist, rain, and snow).

Photography

accentuate, or subdue, details and sections of the image. This
‘stripping’ technique gave a great deal of control over the ﬁnal
appearance of the image by determining how much pigment would
remain; where to retain density and where to forgo it. Each print
was, therefore, unique and revealed the singular touch of the artist.
This process was used to virtuoso effect by Robert Demachy,
Edward Steichen, and others. Gertrude Käsebier provides an
excellent example of the Pictorialist approach. Käsebier has been
described as the ‘typical’ Pictorial photographer.
She ran a professional portrait studio in New York, but also drew
acclaim for her art-photography. Her approach involved taking a
relatively standard, silver gelatin negative from a suitable subject;
she then produced a print which she reworked with a brush,
touching out unwanted details and subduing tonal variety. This
print was then rephotographed and the resulting negative used to
make a gum brichomate print.

Some Pictorialists (like Stieglitz) were wealthy enthusiasts, others
(like Käsebier) were professionals, yet others still occupied a
specialist niche in the amateur leisure market for photographic
commodities; but they all marked their identity in opposition to the
‘mass’ snapper. As Stieglitz put it, the new hand cameras meant that
‘every Tom, Dick or Harry could, without trouble get something on
a sensitive plate’. This kind of photography, he felt, involved ‘no
work and lots of fun’. Stieglitz thought fun had no place in serious
47

Pictures

One important factor in the development of Pictorialism was the
rise of mass amateur photography. In 1880, George Eastman
launched the Kodak camera, which enormously simpliﬁed
the photographic process and reduced the cost. The Kodak
(a word adopted because it could be pronounced the same way
in many European languages. It is, supposedly, an onomatopoeia
for the noise made by the shutter) came ready loaded with roll ﬁlm.
This camera was not equipped with a viewﬁnder, so the
photographer simply aimed in the general direction of the subject
and made the exposure. When the entire roll had been exposed, the
camera was dispatched to the Eastman company, which sent back
the processed photographs and a newly loaded camera. With their
slogan ‘You Press the Button, We Do the Rest’, Eastman made
photography available to those who did not have the time, or
interest, to learn how to develop and print images. This marketing
strategy, exemplifying monopoly trends in capitalism, provided the
pivot for an economic and cultural transformation, which shifted
photographic image-making from the professional studio to the
domestic sphere; commissioned work was similarly replaced by the
sale of equipment and processing. So began what Pictorialist-inchief Alfred Stieglitz called the ‘photographing-by-the-yard era’.
Not all amateurs depended on the Kodak system; some cheaper
cameras required more basic competence, and many (male)
hobbyists prided themselves on their technical ability – indeed for
some, this was the point of photography. Nevertheless, the new
breed of amateur snapper emerged from this business
transformation.

Photography

art-photography. Many amateur Pictorialists took a different view;
for them photography was wrapped up with day trips to the
countryside and the new craze for bicycling. In each case, though,
the efforts to make pictures, the studied composition, hazy effects,
and laborious printing techniques, can be seen as a strategy of
‘distinction’ intended to separate Pictorialists from unskilled
amateurs. In economic terms, this strategy involved a distinction
between the luxury and the mass market; amateur Pictorialists
occupied an intermediate position, as the largest for specialist
commodities.
In addition to his important role as a photographer, Stieglitz was,
perhaps, the champion of art-photography. He was instrumental in
establishing the two leading North American Pictorialist
organizations, the Camera Club and the Photo-Secession (he edited,
and largely funded, the former’s magazine, Camera Notes). He also
ran ‘291’ gallery on 5th Avenue, New York, an exhibition space that
showcased the work of Pictorialist photographers (and later gave
European artists like Picasso and Matisse their ﬁrst US
exhibitions). But perhaps his key contribution came with the
magazine Camera Work, produced between 1903 and 1917. This
lavish publication, funded by Stieglitz, featured photographs, often
printed from the original negatives on expensive paper, using the
highest-quality reproduction techniques (such as photogravure).
Stieglitz personally supervised the production process and
controlled the appearance of the magazine, to the extent that he
even designed advertisements. Camera Work was a luxury product
(it never gained more than 650 subscribers) that signiﬁed craft
quality and authorial attention in a mass-produced, shoddy world.
Stieglitz believed that photography was not accepted as art because
of the bad impression made by mass-produced images – whether
created by commercial practitioners or amateurs having ‘fun’. In
contrast, he set himself the task of transforming photography into a
serious cultural activity.
Pictorialism was to have a mixed legacy: despised by
48

photographers, theorists, and historians inﬂuenced by modernism,
its principal impact was on amateur or mass taste. As late as 1943,
the photographer Edward Weston complained that while ‘Salon
photography’ no longer imitated watercolours or ink drawings, it
continued to follow the rules of composition established in the
pictorial arts. The sensibility of Pictorialism, if not the elaborate
techniques, left a long shadow over amateur pictures and the
general perception of art-photography.

The avant-garde

49

Pictures

While the judgement of later photographers on the 19th-century
art-photography would be harsh indeed, in reality the break with
the predominant sensibility probably began as a tendency within
Pictorialism. The trend known as ‘second-wave’ Pictorialism –
associated with Steiglitz and Alvin Langdon Coburn – forsook artyprinting techniques and abandoned literary/mythic subjects for an
increased focus on modern life and the metropolis. Some of the
most astute recognized that what counted as art had changed:
among connoisseurs and artists the aesthetic of Whistler gave way
to the new painting associated with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso,
and the Italian Futurist group. In the ﬁnal issue of Camera Work,
which appeared in 1917, Stieglitz showcased the work of Paul
Strand, which has frequently been seen as marking a shift in
photographic paradigms. Strand’s pictures exemplify what came to
be called photographic ‘modernism’: his artworks were not
predicated on existing approaches to art. Rather, he based his
pictures on what he took to be the inherent qualities of
photography: he made direct, optically sharp images; often
consisting of details taken from everyday subjects. As Strand put it:
‘At every turn the attempt is made to turn the camera into a brush,
to make the photograph look like a painting, an etching, a charcoal
drawing or whatnot, like anything but a photograph . . . .’. Strand
preferred the ‘simple record in the National Geographic Magazine’
or the ‘aerial photographic record’ to what he called Pictorialism’s
‘bastard photographs’. His argument is based on the idea – central

Photography

to modernist art, whether in sculpture or photography – of ‘truth
to materials’. Carving stone so it appeared like ﬂesh or making
photographs that looked like drawings was thought inauthentic. If
an art of photography was possible, it would have to follow its own
independent path, and not imitate painting or etching. Artphotography had to be ‘based on inherent qualities’ of the ‘medium’
and work with the ‘true laws of photography’. In 1897, Stieglitz had
suggested that ‘microscopic sharpness is of no pictorial value’, but
by 1917 he championed Strand’s ‘brutal directness’. The shift
registered here involves the seeming paradox of the picture in the
shape of a document.
Later US photo-modernism, identiﬁed with Edward Weston and
Ansel Adams, followed the path marked out by Strand and the later
Stieglitz. These ﬁgures practised photography as an independent
art based on what Weston called a ‘vital new way of seeing’.
Painterly subjects and effects were ditched for ‘exaggerating details,
recording surfaces’ in sharply focused prints. This photography was
supposed to be free of any purpose other than expressing the
imagination, or feelings, of the photo-visionary: it was to be
‘autonomous’. But, at the same time, another conception of
photography was developing among European avant-garde artists.
The category of the avant-garde – originally a military term
meaning the ‘advanced guard’ – when applied to modern art usually
encompasses the Futurists, Dadaists, Constructivists, and
Surrealists who worked from c. 1910 to c. 1940. These artists sought
to challenge the ‘autonomy’ of art, or, to put it another way, they
opposed treating art as a precious activity distinct from everyday
life. Often espousing oppositional or revolutionary politics, they
wanted their work to have a role in the reconstruction of society. To
this end, many avant-gardists abandoned the traditional media of
painting and sculpture for practices that allowed them to intervene
directly in modern life: some took to advertising and product
design, or political propaganda and mass media work. The design of
posters, books, magazines, and exhibitions played an important role
in this activity. Arguably, the avant-garde achieved its greatest
50

triumphs in photography, which was cheap to produce and could be
integrated with these new mass forms of communication.

With the avant-garde photography enters the standard histories of
art; as I have noted, photography can be viewed as the exemplary
avant-garde medium. A few of the individuals who appear in art
history books conform to the assumed art-historical model of the
painter who turned against art for social intervention: John
Heartﬁeld, the ex-Dadaist, went on to make photomontages for the
German Communist Party; Lazlo Moholy-Nagy included
photography prominently among his experiments with light. In the
USSR, Alexandr Rodchenko worked with photography in design
and photojournalism (while continuing to produce more
51

Pictures

If these artists envisaged a new role for art on the basis of
photography, they also reinvented the photographic image. The
conception of photography that emerged is sometimes called the
‘New Vision’. Writing in 1929, the critic Werner Gräff argued that
photographs should not be based on ‘aesthetic or artistic rules’ from
‘bygone eras of painting’. Good photographs, he claimed, often ran
‘contrary to the ‘‘rules of art’’ ’. Gräff’s point chimes with the turn
against Pictorialism and 19th-century conceptions that we have
already seen. Like Strand and his American successors, the New
Vision is a form of modernism interested in the new medium and
concerned to elaborate a poetics of technology. To this effect, avantgardists consciously embraced the possibilities offered by camera
and enlarger, producing effects that would previously have been
dismissed as unintelligible: close-ups and details; frozen action;
double exposure; photograms (images made by exposing objects
directly onto sensitized paper without a camera); photomontage
(pictures made by pasting together fragments from other
photographs and then rephotographing the whole); unusual and
extreme angles. Avant-garde artists explored new subjects, but also
new ways of representing them. Their models were no longer drawn
from paintings, but photojournalism or scientiﬁc and technical
documents.

11. Germaine Krull, ‘Dans toute sa force’, from VU, 1928

Street photography
Alongside this avant-garde project, and in many ways inseparable
from it, a new documentary vision took root: this practice has
sometimes been labelled ‘street photography’. This was work in the
‘documentary style’, dedicated to recording the popular life of the
streets – particularly in working-class and immigrant communities
– and which was largely made at the photographers’ own
instigation. A much attenuated list of photographers working in
this mode would include: Henri Cartier-Bresson, André Kertész,
Brassaı̈, Walker Evans, Lisette Model, those associated with the US
Photo League (Walter Rosenblum, Sid Grossman, Aaron Siskind,
Helen Levitt), Bill Brandt, Willy Ronis, and Robert Doisneau.
It is extremely difﬁcult to distinguish this practice from wider
53

Pictures

conventional artworks); El Lissitsky and Gustav Klucis used
photographs in exhibition and poster design (though the former did
continue to paint). But many of the other key ﬁgures typically
characterized as members of the photographic avant-garde were
not artists in the ﬁrst place. August Sander was a portrait
photographer; Karl Blossfeldt an art teacher who photographed
plants as models for his drawing classes; and Germaine Krull was a
photojournalist. In many ways, the idea of avant-garde photography
is an invented category and the central ﬁgure in that production is,
undoubtedly, Walter Benjamin. In his pioneering ‘Small History of
Photography’ (1931), Benjamin included Sander, Blossfeldt, and
Krull, along with Atget and others, as photographers allied to a new
social vision. It was, undoubtedly, part of their attraction for him
that these ﬁgures were not ‘artists’; he was interested in ﬁnding the
points of critical perception in everyday life. But many subsequent
historians have relied on his text to generate an extended category
of the photographic avant-garde. There are some shared values and
practices in this work, but the idea of the avant-garde, as commonly
framed, is a rag-bag category that proves difﬁcult to separate from a
range of other social practices.

12. Henri Cartier-Bresson, Behind the Gare St Lazare, 1932

documentary trends. The categories shade into each other and
frequently change places: photographs by street photographers
appear in the press or other commercial arenas and documentary
work is often exhibited in art galleries. (Brassaı̈, for instance, was
associated with the Surrealists and Evans’s dandyish vision set him
somewhat askance to documentary.) Nevertheless, it is possible to
identify a kind of project in this work that is not quite the same as
documentary; this largely centres on street photographers’ critical
self-direction. By and large, the photographers working in this
mode tended to avoid the two key themes of documentary – war
reportage and social investigation – though, in the case of the latter
category, street photography is characteristically rooted in workingclass spaces, while the Photo League’s ‘Harlem Document’ and
Evans’s FSA work are clearly types of social investigation.

This vision is often identiﬁed with Cartier-Bresson’s concept of ‘the
55

Pictures

This subset of documentary work offers a strange intermediate zone
between art and commercial culture; it is one of those places where
clear distinctions between high and low art, or elite and popular
culture, dissolve. It is not even possible to say that the purposeless
or anti-instrumental character of this work is what deﬁnes it as ‘art’,
because images by these photographers frequently appeared in
commercial publications. Yet, operating in this cross-over space,
photographers created a critical form with a mass audience.
Probably the best way to view this work is to say that these
photographers worked at their own systematic projects
documenting popular life. Particular images could be extracted
from these projects and published in diverse contexts, but the
archives, and the vision, are not reducible to these commercial
outlets. The key form of street photography was the authored
photographic book: Paris de nuit (Brassaı̈, 1933), American
Photographs (Walker Evans, 1938), The English at Home (Bill
Brundt, 1936), The Decisive Moment (Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1952),
Instantanés de Paris (Robert Doisneau, 1955), Belleville
Ménilmontant (Willy Ronis, 1954).

Photography

decisive moment’ – deﬁned as the precise point at which contingent
details aligned to create a perfect compositional arrangement.
However, this notion may be too conventionally artistic to
characterize street photography. It makes more sense, I think, to
view this work as self-consciously artless art. Street photography
was largely a practice of the political left: a vision that sought to
articulate popular values in opposition to ofﬁcial culture. To this
effect, photographers sought out the everyday, the ordinary, and the
commonplace; they were attracted to the humour and popular
traditions of their subjects. They focused on popular entertainment,
life on the street or in the bar, café, or public house. They also
employed a style that claimed not to be one – documentary.
One of the key factors that changed in post-war photography was this
point of popular identiﬁcation. Some photographers continued to
work in the populist mould (particularly in France), but as the full
force of post-war reconstruction (the commercial reshaping of
consciousness and everyday life) became manifest, it proved
increasingly difﬁcult to view popular life as a force inimical to
capitalist social relations. Continued attachment to a populist
documentary vision began to look sentimental and nostalgic. In this
new context, especially in the USA where the full force of these
processes ripped through society, some photographers came to view
the popular life of the street, not as a life untainted by middle-class
values, but as representing a particularly supine embrace of
Mammon’s values. Photographers shifted from adopting the
viewpoint of popular life to a detached and caustic perspective on it.
Initially, at least, this dislocation from popular pleasures produced
highly critical representations of the emerging post-war society. The
books produced by Robert Frank (The Americans, published in
1958) and William Klein (Life is Good and Good for You in New
York: Trance Witness Revels, from 1956) give vent to an alienated
vision of America: as a world of conformity, banality, and latent
violence. In the period of the Cold War, these images did not go
down well with the critics: one described Frank’s book as ‘marred by
56

spite, bitterness and narrow prejudices’; another suggested it
amounted to ‘an attack on the United States’. Increasingly, however,
the street tradition went through a mutation, shedding the vestiges
of social vision for more private concerns. No doubt, the
McCarthyite witch-hunt of ‘subversives’ (which at one point turned
its attention to the Photo League) accelerated this process. Some,
like Aaron Siskind, turned away from their former commitments
to a type of photography that aped abstract painting; others
produced a modiﬁed, formally stylized version of street
photography that foregrounded the perception of the photographer.

Medium speciﬁcity

13. Lee Friedlander, Hillcrest, New York, 1970
57

Pictures

The central ﬁgure in this transformation was perhaps best known
for his work as a curator and critic rather than his pictures. John
Szarkowski was appointed curator of photographs at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York in 1962. From this powerful
institutional base, he produced a highly inﬂuential account of
photography, which jettisoned the social vision of documentary.

This emphasis is apparent in Szarkowski’s important 1967 show
New Documents, which presented the photographs of Diane Arbus,
Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand as inheritors of the
documentary tradition.

Photography

He claimed this work represented a reinvention of documentary.
The 1930s documentary, he argued, had been associated with
projects of social reform and political change. Szarkowski now
claimed that photographers wanted simply to explore the
potential of their medium, or express themselves through it.
If these were documents, they were documents turned
inwards.
Szarkowski presented an account of photography shaped by the
modernist idea of ‘medium speciﬁcity’. We have already seen one
version of this advanced by Paul Strand. This argument, which has
long roots and many variants, suggests that signiﬁcant art results
from the focus on those characteristics inherent in a medium. The
notion of medium speciﬁcity tends to emphasize the means of
depiction over what is depicted. By concentrating on the speciﬁc
features of painting, sculpture, or photography, artists push the
boundaries of their art and create new aesthetic or expressive
effects. Often, this conception involves foregrounding those features
of a medium that distinguish it from other art forms. As we will see,
Szarkowski argues that photography is not a literary form (it does
not involve storytelling). Artists in the post-war modernist
tradition, working in many different arts, explored the parameters
of their medium by stripping away, what they saw as, extraneous
references and accumulated traditions. For painters, this idea
meant testing effects that could be produced by making marks on a
ﬂat surface. In pursuing medium-speciﬁc ways of working, the
visual arts tended to abstraction or ‘puriﬁcation’. However, unlike
paintings, photographs are tied to external appearances. As such,
medium speciﬁcity in photography could not follow in the path of
abstraction; instead it entailed emphasizing what was unique about
a camera image.
58

The Photographer’s Eye isolates ﬁve properties that Szarkowski felt
characterized the medium: ‘The Thing Itself’; ‘The Detail’; ‘The
Frame’; ‘Time’; and ‘Vantage Point’. The issue, for him, was not to
follow established conventions of art, but to make choices based on
the way the photographic apparatus transformed an existing scene
into a unique type of picture. For instance, in discussing the frame,
Szarkowski wrote:
The edges of the picture were seldom neat. Parts of ﬁgures or
buildings or features of landscape were truncated, leaving a shape
59

Pictures

In the catalogue accompanying the exhibition The Photographer’s
Eye (MoMA 1964), Szarkowski insisted that a proper account of
photography had to encompass, as ‘intimately interdependent
aspects of a single history’, both art-photography and the
‘functional’ uses of the medium. He was to make ‘vernacular
photography’ central to art-photography. The term ‘vernacular’
is employed, typically with regard to architecture or articles
of use, to describe anonymous forms that come into being
over a protracted period. In contrast to ‘architecture’, associated
with named makers and conscious stylistic trends, vernacular
buildings are lowly, everyday, and traditional. A barn is often a
vernacular building, a bank rarely is. Vernacular photographs
include amateur snapshots of family high days and holidays,
or the types of functional document found in specialist
archives: police images, technical records, and so on. Strand’s
examples from the National Geographic or aerial surveys
convey the point well. Szarkowski believed that vernacular
photographs made by ‘journeymen’, ‘hobbyists’, technical
document-makers, and so forth revealed what was essential
about photographic seeing. According to him, making
photographic pictures did not entail imitating painting, but
following through the implications of an apparatus. The
photographers he championed – Winogrand, Friedlander, Arbus,
William Eggleston, and others – produced autonomous pictures
rooted in vernacular conventions.

belonging not to the subject, but (if the picture was a good one) to

the balance, the propriety, of the image.

In this sense, photographs isolate and focus attention on ‘details’.
A number of these categories will crop up, in various guises, later
in this book, and I am not going to develop them here. What
needs to be observed, is that for Szarkowski features inherent in
photography are most often apparent in vernacular images:
lopped-off heads abound in the family album. But, he believed,
whereas 19th-century art-photography and Pictorialism repressed
these features, the best photo-art consciously built on these
characteristics. This is to say, the implications of contemporary
art-photographers were latent in the medium from the outset.
‘Like an organism’, he claimed, ‘photography was born whole’. Art
in photography is made from details and fragments; unusual
vantage points; effects that emphasize odd things that seem to
sprout from the tops of heads; and so on. Development in artphotography, according to him, is driven by the medium becoming
self-conscious. Sometimes photographers appear to be the bearers
of this unfolding photographic consciousness, but the implications
were always present in the medium itself. What makes some
photographers special, in Szarkowski’s view, is the rigour with
which they pursue the unique characteristics of photography.
There is a great deal to be learned from this account. Nevertheless,
its transhistorical emphasis is deeply problematic. It is difﬁcult to
imagine how photography, as perhaps the privileged medium of
20th-century communication, can be dealt with as a singular
‘medium’. The practical use of photographic documents, or their
role in generating social and sexual fantasies, have much greater
weight than art-photography, but Szarkowski glosses over these
everyday practices. Szarkowski tends to strip photographs of their
speciﬁc context and use in order to tell a single story of art. It is
worth noting that his tenure at MoMA coincided with the
revaluation of photography in the art museum. This is the period
when photographs entered the art market in a signiﬁcant way.
60

Szarkowski’s particular version of ‘modernism’ provides one
ingenious way of stabilizing this category. As photographer-theorist
Allan Sekula suggested, his approach:
neutralizes and renders equivalent, it is a universalizing system of
reading. Only formalism can unite all the photographs in the world
in one room, mount them behind glass, and sell them.

The everyday and the mass media
At the same time that this later generation of street photographers
championed by Szarkowski was busy exploring the particular kind
of image that could be produced with a camera, artists began using
photographs in an altogether different way. Many of them
didn’t give a damn about which characteristics were peculiar
to the medium; they cared even less about a convoluted
art-photography.

61

Pictures

By the 1960s, the discourse and the practice of medium speciﬁcity
seemed played out in adventurous art (it persisted a while longer in
art-photography); the art produced according to this conception
was increasingly formulaic and empty, and rather than acting as an
impetus to critical thought, the ideas had become a barrier to it. In
any case, this version of modernism was never totally hegemonic:
some artists had continued to produce representations or work in
deliberately hybrid and ‘impure’ forms. In this vein, it made sense
that some artists became interested in exploring the effects and
forms of mass photography. For instance, Pop artist Andy Warhol
made paintings by applying found photographs to canvas with the
silk screen print technique. Typically, Warhol repeated the same
image four, six, eight times, sometimes more, building up a grid of
photographic images that displayed minor variations. Sometimes
he varied the colour; sometimes the resulting picture consisted of
nothing but (almost) identical black and white images. Warhol, like
many of the artists who followed him, was interested in the banality
of photography, rather than its potential for making nuanced and

complicated pictures. The range of his subjects – disasters, suicides,
race riots, and celebrities – has the feel of a compendium of the
mass media at a particular moment. Photography really attained its
current status in contemporary art when artists ditched any
attempt to produce a unique, medium-speciﬁc art of photography
and began to trade on its actual uses, in particular on the
photograph as a seemingly literal carrier of information. What came
to matter to this generation of artists was the role photography
played in everyday life; its ubiquity and its ability to record events,
people, and things; its role in the increasingly prominent
consciousness industries. Describing the books he made with
photographs, the artist Ed Ruscha said:
Above all, the photographs I use are not ‘arty’ in any sense of the
word. I think photography is dead as a ﬁne art; its only place is in
Photography

the commercial world, for technical or information purposes. I
don’t mean cinema photography, but still photography, that is
limited edition, individual, hand-processed photographs. Mine
are simply reproductions of photographs. This is not a book to
house a collection of art photographs – they are technical data
like industrial photography. To me, they are nothing more than
snapshots.

This does not mean that what artists did with photographs at this
time was any less complex or ambitious than medium-speciﬁc
practice (Ruscha’s work is a case in point), but what increasingly
mattered was photography’s ordinariness and utility.
Photography has been able to assume a prominent role in
contemporary art because its various forms and uses mesh with
modern culture itself. From the 1960s, artists became particularly
engaged with everyday life under late capitalism; the very
instability and reach of photography came to occupy a central place
in their panoply of techniques and strategies. In the ﬁrst instance,
those working in what has been called the ‘expanded ﬁeld’ of art
(the exploration of new materials and possibilities beyond
62

traditional deﬁnitions of painting and sculpture) adopted the
photographic document for its simple power of recording. In
Conceptual art, and the forms that spiralled out of it (performance
or body art, land art), photography provided a useful tool for
presenting information, or for displaying works that were
time-based, ephemeral, or inaccessible. A remote earthwork or
journey, a temporary installation, an action or event could all be
recorded and represented as photo-documents. Bernd and Hilla
Becher’s archive of disappearing industrial forms begun in the
1960s – mine heads, cooling towers, blast furnaces – provides an
exemplary instance. In these works, the photograph functions as a
trace of its subject: the form is plain and direct. Banality can, of
course, be employed as a device for stretching the viewer’s attention
– for renewing art in a distracted age; similarly, some artists used
the plain document as a counter-weight to the spectacular values of
the mass media.

The continued exploration of everyday life in photography usually
retains the rhetoric of the document to reveal the overlooked and
the ordinary. The focus here is on those things, activities, or places
that usually draw little attention: say, a simple gesture, the space
under a bed, the debris of a meal, or a section of carpet. Sometimes
63

Pictures

In contemporary art, the photographic image is used to examine
a wide range of identities, fantasies, memories, places, and so on.
Nevertheless, two main tendencies are discernible: on the one hand,
artists and photographers have continued to use the rhetoric of the
document, adopted during the 1960s and 1970s, to explore
everyday life; and, on the other, they have investigated the role of
photography in mass culture, usually employing staged images.
These concerns are closely related, because everyday life in late
capitalism is closely entwined with mass imagery. Neither branch is
very interested in the high-ﬂown values traditionally associated
with art; both versions pay less attention to complexities of form
than to photography’s uses. (Though, this investigation of use can
lead to new ideas about form.)

Photography

these things attain a strange beauty, at others their very
ordinariness is stressed; in some instances, the seemingly trivial
details of life take on a transcendent or quasi-spiritual quality, in
others the photographer keeps things down-to-earth. At least since
the New Topographic work of the 1970s, which rejected traditional
romantic visions of nature for a focus on the ‘man-altered
landscape’, photographers have been preoccupied with depicting
ordinary places – usually those that have gone without notice or
been disparaged: trailer parks, suburban areas, the detritus
gathered under a roadway bridge, or scraps of urban waste land.
One variant involves photographs of poignant spaces, those empty
and derelict sites that have been associated with repression, torture,
and state power – notorious prison camps, bombed-out military
installations, nuclear bunkers, and the rest. This work trades on the
‘banality of evil’ – the very ordinariness of these sites of modern
horror, which display minimal traces of their previous function –
but also the banality of the images.
Medium-speciﬁc practice in photography drew its vernacular
models from photojournalism and amateur snapshots, but this
entails a highly restricted idea of the photographic medium.
Advertising, fashion, porn, and so on typically all fall outside this
vision. In contrast, much contemporary photographic art has been
preoccupied with these commercial forms; this entails a very
different sense of photography, which includes attention to ideology
and mass-produced fantasy. Since the 1970s, many artists and
photographers have made images that interrogate photography’s
role in these wider social forms and their effects. Often this
investigation entails recourse to ‘impure’ photographic forms that
mix text or recorded sound with images, combine genres, or use
images appropriated from the mass media. Predominantly, these
photographers have abandoned the ‘straight aesthetic’ of the street
photographer for an art of staging or construction, which involves
setting up events or performing for the camera. Work of this type
allows photographers to explore complex scenarios or attitudes in a
situation under their control.

14. Cindy Sherman, Untitled Film Still No. 37, 1979

Cindy Sherman’s pictures, to take one prominent example, employ
the conventions of cinema, particularly melodrama, to unmask
some powerful ideologies of femininity as appearance.
In the series Untitled Film Stills, begun in 1977, Sherman features
in each picture in a different guise, pose, and scenario. These
photographs are in some sense self-portraits, but they are
paradoxical ones. Much of the critical effect of Sherman’s Film
65

Photography

Stills results from her presence in these staged scenes, because in
each picture she appears as a different character. Feminists have
suggested there is no real Sherman to be found beneath these
pictures: the images of femininity are all there is. Sherman’s staging
of the conventional images of women brings into view the way that
gender, in this case femininity, is partly a product of the mass
media. The idea that there are a range of ‘styles’, ‘images’, or ‘looks’
that we can adopt is now prevalent enough: a brief list of the images
of women she has created include the dumb blonde, the bad girl,
and the femme fatale. The identities are made, in part at least,
through images: femininity is inseparable from the formal
conventions of the picture, which include lighting, pose,
composition and pictorial style, and bodily comportment.
Increasingly, these issues and approaches have tended to converge
and cross over. Rather than documenting everyday life, some have
taken to reconstructing these scenes. Jeff Wall, for instance, creates
elaborately constructed scenarios using the full panoply of ﬁlm
production techniques to produce pictures of ordinary life: a street
ﬁght, a sleepless night, and so on. For Wall, this technique enables a
complex exploration of social situations without the voyeurism
implicit in much of the street tradition. Whereas a number of
German photographers, prominent for the last 20 years, have
pictured everyday life in high-colour images on the scale of museum
art. In contrast, others have continued to work in a form derived
from documentary. Allan Sekula’s monumental Fish Story – one of
the richest presentations of the modern world in any medium –
represents a ‘documentary’ practice informed by the critique of this
mode. Indeed, Sekula played a key role in developing this critical
understanding of documentary. In a related vein, one recent large
exhibition drew together a range of artists who all base their work
on the contemporary news media. The examples could be
multiplied. Photography occupies a pivotal location in
contemporary art, because its diverse forms and seeming proximity
to reality has enabled it to become an important tool for exploring
modern culture and its values.

Chapter 4
What is a photograph?

In the two preceding chapters I examined some structuring
distinctions shaping our experience of photographs: principally, the
opposition between documents and pictures; documentary and art.
In this chapter, and the one that follows, I want to go over some of
the same ground, but where Chapters 2 and 3 treated this problem
historically, here the emphasis will be more theoretical, but also
more experiential. This will involve some attention to the invention
of photography.

Proof
In the ﬁlm Proof the central character – Martin, who is blind – takes
photographs of things in order to test their existence. The ﬁlm
centres on the relationship between Martin and his housekeeper,
Celia: he withholds the love and affection she craves; Celia responds
with small acts of sadism – positioning objects so he will stumble
over them, enticing away his guide-dog, continually watching him,
and, eventually, seducing his one friend. The malice and humour
evident in Proof revolve around Martin’s rejection of Celia and her
minor cruelties, but underpinning all this is the theme of trust, and
photography is central to this issue. Martin does not trust the
sighted, because he is unable to verify their descriptions. As far as
he is concerned, sighted people are able to deceive him with false, or
inaccurate, accounts of appearances. He believes his mother was
67

Photography

embarrassed by him and suspects that she took her revenge by
describing things that were not there (he even claims that she faked
her own death to escape from him). Martin photographs things and
events, subsequently he has an independent witness describe the
images – ﬁrstly Celia, and then his friend Andy. In so far as these
people did not witness the things represented, but corroborate what
he knows of events and what people have said to him, he is able to
verify the situations he experienced. He is, of course, also testing the
describers of the pictures. (As the plot unfolds, this becomes
complicated, because Andy and Celia increasingly wish to keep
secrets from Martin.) Photography performs this role in Proof
because it is assumed to be an automatic and mechanical recording
technology, which accurately reproduces the appearance of things.
In this ﬁlm, the camera is presented as an objective and
independent witness, operating independently of the photographer
and his desires (he can’t even see what it sees). Eventually, through
the medium of an old black-and-white image, Martin discovers
what he took to be a key example of his mother’s descriptive deceit
was, in fact, an accurate account.
Photographs might be truthful, Proof suggests, but the descriptions
of pictures are not at all reliable. The ﬁlm thus entwines
photography with trust, anxiety, and human relationships (it is clear
that this scenario is a metaphor for ﬁlm-making itself, and perhaps
for the activity of the critic), but the idea that ‘the camera never lies’
saturates our culture. Common sense perceives the photograph as a
‘transparent’ or ‘unmediated’ copy of reality. This conception of
photography as an objective recording technology can be found in
the news media, which takes as one of its founding ideologies the
idea that the apparatus presents an impartial record of events and is
equally present in the family album, which employs photographs to
memorialize key (if selective) rites of passage. We have come to
distrust advertising, but even here we doubt less the images than
the motivations of the persons who put them into place.
Pornography (one of the mainstays of photographic imagery in
68

Western society) similarly relies on the strange realism of the
camera. Despite the staged, fantasy scenarios, dodgy sets, and
carefully arranged lighting, these pictures appear to offer their
viewer direct access to a body and its organs. In pornography, like so
many other forms of photography, the viewer is induced to look
through the surface of the paper or the screen and imagine
themselves in the full presence of another person: we might
recognize the ﬁction, but nevertheless . . . . Much of the power of
photography derives from this kind of compelling illusion. What
needs accounting for is the peculiar form of the photographic
image, which appears not to be an image at all; rather, it seems like
a direct re-presentation of lived reality. Photography’s effects, for
good or ill, derive from this constitutive condition.

In 1945, the ﬁlm critic André Bazin provided a classic statement of
this common-sense conception in his essay ‘The Ontology of the
Photographic Image’. Bazin claimed that photography (and
cinema) satisﬁed the basic human desire for illusion and realism.
For him, the important point was that the camera was a ‘nonliving
agent’. He wrote:
[f]or the ﬁrst time an image of the world is formed automatically,
without the creative intervention of man. The personality of the
69

What is a photograph?

The idea that photography represents an unmediated, faithful
re-presentation of things has been hanging around the medium for
a long time. As we have seen, some of the earliest conceptions of the
process were based on this sense of automatic recording. As Talbot
put it, in photography: ‘it is not the artist who makes the picture,
but the picture which makes ITSELF’. Because the camera was
thought to require only minimal human intervention to generate
images, the resulting pictures were deemed impartial and free of
subjective intention. Art-photographers worked very hard to
wrench their images away from this common-sense view that
photography produced a literal copy of reality, which required little
or no intervention from the ‘operator’.

photographer enters into the proceedings only in his selection of the
object to be photographed and by way of the purpose he has in
mind. Although the ﬁnal result may reﬂect something of his
personality, this does not play the same role as is played by that of
the painter.

In Bazin’s account, the absence, or minimal involvement, of the
photographer resulted in a picture independent of subjective
volition. This ‘impassive mechanical process’ conferred on
photography ‘a quality of credibility absent from all other
picture-making’. Bazin thought photographs to be objective,
faithful copies of things. Looking at a photograph, he suggested, we
are ‘forced to accept as real the existence of the object reproduced’.
He claimed:

Photography

[t]he photographic image is the object itself, the object freed from
the conditions of space and time that govern it. No matter how
fuzzy, distorted, or discoloured, no matter how lacking in
documentary value the image might be, it shares, by virtue of the
very process of its becoming, the being of the model which it is the
reproduction; it is the model.

The photograph and the object it represents, according to Bazin,
share a ‘common being, after the fashion of a ﬁngerprint’. (Despite
all this, he ended by claiming ‘[o]n the other hand, of course,
cinema is also a language’.) To begin to understand what is claimed
for photography here, we need to know something of the ‘very
process of its becoming’ that Bazin spoke of.

Invention
The story of photography’s invention is complex and is surrounded
with a great deal of mythology. All I want to do in this chapter is
give some sense of the way the basic features of the process shape
our experience of photographic images. Photography did not
spring forth from nowhere: in the expanding capitalist culture of
70

the late 18th and early 19th centuries, some people were on the
look-out for cheap mechanical means for producing images, both
portraits for the new middle class and the wide range of visual
documents required by the new society. Some existing reproductive
techniques preceded new uses; others were devised to meet the
emerging desires.

There was clearly an interest in reproductive technologies at this
time. Photography was related to these devices as a technique for
mechanizing drawing, but it was also distinct from them in
signiﬁcant ways. Joel Snyder has convincingly argued that
photography emerged experimentally from the conjuncture of three
factors: i) concerns with amateur drawing and/or techniques for
71

What is a photograph?

Towards the end of the 18th century, a Silhouette apparatus was
introduced in France: the sitter, illuminated from behind with a
candle, was placed behind an upright sheet of paper, the artist could
then simply draw around the outline, and ﬁll it in. In 1786, the
Frenchman Gilles-Louis Chrétien introduced the Physionotrace,
which could be used to speed up the production of portraits: one
sitting resulted in twelve engravings. The Physionotrace was based
on the pantograph (a device consisting of a series of jointed rods,
which reproduces whatever is traced with a stylus at one end on a
different scale at the other). The sitter was placed before a screen
and traced resulting in a reduced outline that could then be
embellished by the artist. In Britain, methods for producing
mechanical paintings were devised, in the later 18th century by
Matthew Boulton and Joseph Booth (the latter made a direct
analogy between his apparatus and the Lancashire cotton
factories); while James Watt developed a machine for ‘the art of
multiplying statues by machinery’. In the early 19th century,
Charles Babbage, the mathematician and pioneer of computing,
also recorded the existence of drawing machines: he described two
exhibited automata – the ‘Prosopographus’ and the ‘Corinthian
Maid’ – that could, by means of a pantograph attached to a drawing
instrument (the camera lucida), execute the likeness of sitters.

Photography

reproducing printed matter; ii) light-sensitive materials; iii) the use
of the camera obscura (this is discussed below, but basically it
involved a dark room or box that enabled a cast image of external
objects to become visible). Until these distinct factors came into
alignment in the work of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, Talbot,
and others, photography could not be imagined.
Photography made its ﬁrst public appearance in 1839 when its
discovery was announced by the scientist and French Republican
politician François Arago at the Institut de France. In his statement,
Arago attributed the discovery to Daguerre: in fact, Daguerre had
worked with, and built on, the discoveries of Joseph Nicéphore
Niépce, who died before the announcement had been made. Arago’s
public pronouncement brought forward a series of counter-claims
from others who suggested they had invented photography,
including Hippolyte Bayard in France and Talbot in England;
perhaps, most strikingly, it has subsequently been understood that
Antoine Hércules Romauld Florence, a Frenchman who settled in
Brazil in 1824, independently discovered photography and may
have been the ﬁrst to use the word itself (he used the process to
print labels and ornamental patterns). All these men had worked at
the problem of how to produce images with light and chemical
substances, and they all came up with distinct solutions. On
hearing about photography in 1839, the eminent British scientist
Sir John Herschel worked out how to do it for himself in a few
months. All in all, it has been suggested that as many as 24 people
claimed to have originated photography. The fact that so many
researchers had been working on the problem suggests that they
were responding to a felt need. Society sets itself precisely those
problems that it can solve.
The conditions for photography’s emergence (in the light of so
many competing claims, the words ‘invention’ or ‘discovery’ seem a
little overblown) were earlier experiments with light-sensitive
chemicals and the prior use of the camera obscura. When, during
the 1820s and 1830s, these elements were combined, they produced
72

a remarkably powerful image system. In the course of the 18th
century, Johann Heinrich Schulze, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Jean
Senebier had all observed that silver salts darkened on exposure to
light. While Schulze’s experiments were conﬁned to his notebook,
this phenomenon became known through the publications of the
other two men.

None of these early chemical experimenters employed a
camera obscura (or other drawing apparatus) in conjunction
with their experiments on silver salts. The principle of the
camera obscura (literally ‘dark room’) has been understood since
antiquity.
73

What is a photograph?

In 1802, Thomas Wedgwood and Humphrey Davy published a
paper in the Journal of the Royal Institution giving details of how
to copy silhouettes or drawings on paper, or pale leather, treated
with silver nitrate. They attempted to copy paintings on glass by
projecting light through them onto a ﬂat surface treated with this
chemical solution. The silver nitrate used by Wedgwood and Davy,
however, was insufﬁciently sensitive and they failed in their aim;
they had more success with silhouettes placed in direct contact with
the treated paper or leather. (This kind of photographic image
produced, without a camera, by placing an object directly on to
light-sensitive material and exposing it, is typically called ‘contact
printing’; the images themselves are referred to as ‘contact prints’.)
On exposure to light, the area not obscured by the paper darkened.
The result was an inverted image of the original: the area screened
by the cut-out proﬁle remained white, while the general ground of
the image turned black. There is some doubt about these early
experiments, it is probable, though, that Wedgwood and Davy did
produce images, but that they were unable to stabilize, or ‘ﬁx’, them.
Gradually the light areas darkened, and then the whole thing faded
away. As they said in their paper: ‘nothing but a method of
preventing the unshaded part of the delineation from being
coloured by exposure to the day is wanting, to render the process as
useful as it is elegant’.

15. Portable camera obscura for drawing from nature, 1781

It was observed that when light passed through a small aperture in
a shutter covering the window to a dark room, a cast, inverted
image of the external view appeared on the opposite wall. The Arab
scholar Alhazen commented on the camera obscura in the 11th
century, and it was discussed by a number of other writers before
Giovanni Battista della Porta made the apparatus familiar to
Renaissance artists in 1558. At some point in the 16th century, a
lens replaced the simple aperture; because the lens gathered light
across its surface and focused it at one point, it sharpened and
intensiﬁed the cast image. At this stage the camera obscura was still
literally a room; in the century that followed small versions began to
appear in which a lens was attached to a box or tube. Fitting an
internal mirror into these small devices allowed the cast image to be
turned the right way up. When a ground glass screen was
substituted for the plane onto which the image was cast, the artist
could trace the projected view. The camera obscura cast a
perspective image of whatever appeared in front of it, but this image
had to be recorded by a human hand employing a drawing pencil;
as such, it was more suitable for depicting static objects than
dynamic ones. For unchanging views, however, the camera obscura
allowed perspectivally accurate drawings to be made with much less
time and trouble than working with hand and eye alone.
74

There was nothing inevitable about the conjunction of the camera
obscura and light-sensitive chemicals. In fact, both key components
of the photograph had been known for a century before they were
united. Furthermore, while the early photographic experimenters
all created images using chemical substances sensitive to light, not
all of them combined these materials with the camera obscura.
Sometimes Talbot employed a camera obscura; at others he made
contact prints like those attributed to Wedgwood and Davy. In the
period between 1816 and 1828, Niépce worked on a printing process
using light-sensitive substances. In the main, he was concerned to
copy existing pictures (he was looking for a reproductive technique
that would replace lithography), but around 1826 he did succeed,
after several hours’ exposure, in making an image from a bedroom
window in a camera obscura (the result is often regarded as the
oldest surviving photograph).
Niépce experimented with a range of plates, including silver,
pewter, and silver-plated copper. He also investigated a range of
chemicals such as silver chlorine and iodine, but he had most
75

What is a photograph?

Many artists – Canaletto prominent among them; probably Jan
Vermeer too – made use of the camera obscura. Talbot felt that the
‘fairy pictures’ viewed on the ground glass of this apparatus were
incredibly beautiful, but, unless it was used by a skilled
draughtsman, the tracing that resulted was ‘a mere souvenir of the
scene’. Consequently, he set about ﬁnding a way to ﬁx this image.
The modern photographic camera is, in essentials, a camera
obscura: light passes through a lens onto a plane, but, whereas the
traditional arrangement focused light on a glass screen, in the
photographic camera light is made to converge on a chemically
sensitized plate or ﬁlm. In modern cameras, a diaphragm, which
can be opened and closed, has been introduced into the lens,
enabling the photographer to increase or decrease the amount of
light that falls on plate or ﬁlm; a shutter has also been added
between the lens and the ﬁlm in order to control the length of
exposure.

success with bitumen of Judea, which becomes insoluble when
exposed to light. In order to copy prints or drawings, he ﬁrst oiled,
or varnished, the original, making it transparent; he then applied
this image to a plate treated with bitumen of Judea and subjected it
to light. Where the dark areas of the image blocked light from
coming into contact with the treated area, the bitumen of Judea
remained soft and could subsequently be washed away with
lavender oil. He then treated this plate as one would treat an
etching plate: that is to say, the plate was immersed in acid,
creating an indentation or furrow where the metal was exposed,
whereas those portions of the plate that had been obscured by
the hardened bitumen of Judea were left untouched. After this
acid biting the plate was cleaned back to the metal surface, leaving
the areas that had been uncovered recessed and the section that
had been protected from the acid standing proud. At this point,
Niépce had a printing plate: when ink was applied and wiped
clean, the recessed areas retained a residue of printers’ ink, whereas
any area that had not been touched by the acid would not. When a
sheet of paper was applied to the plate under pressure, the result
was a (reversed) printed facsimile in ink of the original print or
drawing.
In 1829, Niépce entered into collaboration with artist, set painter,
and showman Daguerre, who had also been experimenting with
camera obscura images. When Niépce died in 1833, Daguerre
continued to experiment with chemically produced images. He
concentrated on what has come to be known as the ‘latent image’:
when light-sensitive materials are exposed to light they register an
image, which can remain latent or invisible. However, this latent
image can be boosted and brought out by subsequent chemical
treatment; in modern photography we say it can be ‘developed’.
Before the principle of the latent image was understood, the
production of photographic images required very long exposures to
light. But the latent image treated with accelerating agents or
‘developers’, allowed much shorter exposure times. Niépce had
already experimented with latency, treating his plates after
76

exposure with iodine, but Daguerre was able to improve the process
considerably with mercury vapour. He produced his images –
known as daguerreotypes – by treating silver-plated copper sheet,
which had been highly polished, with iodine fumes.

16. Daguerre, Still Life, 1837
77

What is a photograph?

The resulting chemical reaction created a deposit of light-sensitive
silver iodide on the plate. This plate was then exposed for four or
ﬁve minutes in a camera obscura. After exposure, Daguerre treated
the exposed plate with mercury vapour to enhance the latent image:
the result was a highly detailed photograph. He was able to stabilize
this process with a common salt solution which prevented any
further reaction to light. Before 1851, the daguerreotype, partly
because of patent restrictions on other processes and partly due to
its remarkable detail, dominated European photography. It did,
though, have some signiﬁcant drawbacks: the image was very
fragile and contact with the surface easily rubbed it from the plate,
so daguerreotypes were kept in protective velvet and glass cases.
The key problem, however, was that each image was unique. The

Photography

daguerreotype did not really solve the problem of reproduction or
the need for multiple images.
Working in England, Talbot came up with a different process,
which, while it did not have the high resolution of Daguerre’s
technique, did enable him to produce multiple copies. In many
ways, subsequent photographic processes derive from Talbot’s
conception of photography. Working on his process from 1833, he
began making cameraless contact prints by coating paper with
successive treatments of salt and silver nitrate, which reacted to
produce light-sensitive silver chloride. He then placed ﬂat,
transparent or translucent objects (leaves, plants, lace) directly
onto the paper and set them in the sun for a period ranging
anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Once again, where light
passed uninhibited through these objects, the paper darkened;
where the light was blocked, the paper retained its original colour.
Talbot stabilized the image with a strong salt solution which
dissolved the residual silver salts. He called these images
‘photogenic drawings’.
In February 1835, he realized that the process could be repeated
by using this ﬁrst image as a ‘negative’, which could subsequently
be used to generate a second ‘positive’ print. (The terms negative
and positive were suggested by Herschel, who is usually also
credited with coining the term ‘photography’, which literally
means ‘light writing’.) Theoretically, this meant that a large
number of positive prints could be generated from a single
negative and that in these positives the light and dark areas would
roughly parallel those in the object depicted. However, at this
stage, Talbot’s negatives were insufﬁciently dense to create strong
positive images. In 1840, he discovered a second process, which
he called the Calotype (from the Greek word kalos for beautiful
and useful). The Calotype process combined silver nitrate with
acetic acid and gallic acid, and produced a latent image after an
exposure of a few seconds. Talbot treated the outcome with an
accelerating agent (gallic acid), enhancing the latent image, this
78

resulted in a negative strong enough to allow further copies to be
produced.
Throughout the 19th century, improvements to lenses and better
chemical solutions signiﬁcantly reduced exposure times. However, a
central problem still faced photographic experimenters: all these
processes were monochrome. Black-and-white photographs
register levels of luminosity rather than colours. Experiments with
coloured photography have a long and intricate history; here I
simply want to indicate some basic principles.

79

What is a photograph?

Colour photography is rooted in Sir Isaac Newton’s demonstration
that white light can be split prismatically into a rainbow of
component colours (wavelengths of light). Colour photographs
have, essentially, been made in one of two ways: on the one hand,
are those processes that involve breaking down the image into a
number of distinct single colour registrations. In this kind of
process, three, or sometimes more, monochrome images
(typically, a cyan blue image, a magenta image, and a yellow
one) are superimposed, or bonded, to create a multi-colour
photograph. Processes of this type are known as ‘separation
processes’. Photographs in the second category are produced,
not by superimposing separate layers, but through chemical
reaction. Modern versions of this second technique are based
on a principle of ‘chromogenesis’: that is to say, molecules of
coloured dye react with silver salts exposed to light. In one version,
different coloured dyes are suspended in layers of emulsion. The
coloured layers become active when darkening silver salts react
with these dyes; the silver is then bleached out to leave only the
speciﬁc colour present in that layer of ﬁlm. In another chromogenic
process, coloured dyes are coupled to silver in the developing
process. For this reason, chromogenic processes are sometimes
called ‘colour-coupling processes’. It is notable that in each case,
pre-set colours are activated by light: colour photographs
approximate the colours seen in the world, rather than strictly
reproducing them.

It should be clear from the preceding descriptions of black and
white, as well as colour, processes that photographs occur when
light bouncing off objects causes chemical changes in a ﬁlm or plate.
This means that photographs are, in highly signiﬁcant ways,
direct impressions of the things they depict. The chemical bond
between light and silver salts, or chromogenic dyes, has important
consequences for our understanding of photographs. (At the end of
this book, I will come to the question of digital images and how they
may depart from the conditions of these ‘analogue’ forms of
photography.)

Photography

Signiﬁcation
These optical-chemical processes make photographs very peculiar
images. As we have seen, André Bazin drew the conclusion from
photography’s ‘very process of its becoming’ that the image was an
unmediated copy, or trace, of the object before the lens. As with any
complex ﬁeld of culture, there is now a range of competing
interpretations of what this process means: in this section I am
going to outline a powerful argument for photographic realism
(disbelief will be suspended for the next chapter).
One inﬂuential approach to photography involves recourse to ideas
developed by the American Pragmatist philosopher Charles
Sanders Peirce, who was active at the end of the 19th century. Peirce
was a polymath who wrote on mathematics, religion, logic, and a
dozen things besides; he barely mentioned photography, but his
work on the typology of signs employed in communication has a
direct bearing on photography. Peirce was a pioneer in the study of
the role played by signs in the construction of meaning, an
intellectual approach to culture called semiology or semiotics.
Peirce argued that all communication takes place through the
medium of signs, which must always be embodied in some material
vehicle, whether a spoken word or a metal road sign. His work in
this ﬁeld is complex, technical, and much debated: Peirce was fond
of tabulating all possible permutations – originally identifying 10
80

combinations for signs (he later extended this to 66 correlations).
For our purposes, we can focus on one sign triad that appears in his
important essay ‘Logic as Semiotic: The Theory of Signs’, written
between 1897 and c. 1910. In this text, Peirce drew attention to three
components of signs: these are often characterized as ‘iconic signs’,
‘indexical signs’, and ‘symbolic signs’, though, strictly speaking,
these are not distinct types of sign at all, but features shared by
signs.

This is an important point in relation to the second category of signs
– indexical signs – which entail some direct relationship to the
object at issue. Peirce suggests that while indices do not necessarily
resemble the objects they refer to, they bear a causal connection to
those objects and would not have the character they do if their
81

What is a photograph?

Iconic signs share some qualitative characteristic with the object
they represent; icons, in some way or other, resemble the object
they stand for. Peirce drew his example from mathematical
formulae, but the example of ﬁgurative art may help to illustrate the
point. Painting and drawing can convey meaning through visual
resemblance between the sign and the object depicted: a drawing
of a chair shows a four-legged object, with a seat and a back, in
three-dimensional space. While we are unlikely to confuse pencil
marks on a sheet of paper with the thing we sit on, a drawing can
represent or resemble a chair. Icons continue to operate in this
fashion even when the characteristics shared with the object are
radically simpliﬁed: think, for instance, of the sign ‘No Dogs
Allowed’, which reduces the canine image to a few easily
recognizable characteristics and which differs from any actual
animal. As Peirce put it, a diagram is an icon ‘even though there be
no sensuous resemblance between it and its object, but only an
analogy between the relations of the parts of each’. One key
characteristic of iconic signs, according to Peirce, is that they can
operate even in the absence of the object in question: a drawing
does not need to depict an actual chair for us to recognize it as an
image of a chair.

Photography

object was absent or did not exist. A footprint, for instance, was
caused by the human presence that we take it to signify; a mooing
sound calls to mind a particular kind of animal; and, as the proverb
has it, ‘there is no smoke without ﬁre’. To return to André Bazin’s
example, a ﬁngerprint is an index of a particular human ﬁnger,
separate from all others. Because indexical signs are causally linked
to their object, they come into being at a deﬁnite time and in a
particular place, they usually refer to individual cases rather than
generic categories. Whereas the sign ‘No Dogs Allowed’ refers to
dogs in general, the excrement on the pavement is an index of an all
too particular animal. Indices direct attention to their object; like
the index ﬁnger, they point. (Because signs need to be embodied in
material forms, all signs must have an indexical component.)
Peirce’s third category – symbolic signs – conveys meaning by
convention and consensus; operating, according to him, ‘by virtue of
a law’. Red, amber, and green lights, for example, are conventional
signs employed to control trafﬁc ﬂows. Symbolic signs play the
central role in human communication: as Peirce suggested, words
and sentences are conventional signs and, therefore, symbols. Both
written and spoken words convey meaning through conventional
use and not through any intrinsic relation to their referents.
Many commentators have suggested, on the basis of Peirce’s
account, that photographs are indexical signs. This is not quite
right: his distinctions are meant as abstract categories to help us see
how signs work, rather than exclusive types. Any actual sign,
photography in this instance, will combine these features. The
iconic dimension of photographs ought to be readily apparent, since
photographs look like the things they depict; under particular
circumstances, photographs also produce symbolic meanings (a
photograph of an assassinated political leader carried on a
demonstration can symbolize a struggle for justice); and because
photographs are the direct result of light bouncing off depicted
objects, they bear an indexical relation to the thing pictured. As
Peirce put it:
82

[p]hotographs, especially instantaneous photographs, are very
instructive, because we know that they are in certain respects
exactly like the objects they represent. But this resemblance is due to
the photographs having been produced under such circumstances
that they were physically forced to correspond point by point to
nature.

This conjunction of index and icon in photographic signs – and
related media such as ﬁlm and video – has important implications
for how we understand the kinds of pictures that can be produced.
It has often been noted that, whereas painters can create imaginary
scenarios, invention for the photographer is restricted to dealing
with things in front of the camera. As we have seen, Robinson felt
that the painter could depict ‘angels and cherubim’ and so forth, but
that the same act would make the photographer appear ridiculous.
Painters are free to invent characters, or generate compositions by
rearranging, eradicating, or adding objects and forms.
Photographers might move a stone or arrange a still life, but they
can’t move mountains to create more picturesque landscape
arrangements. Photography, in contrast to painting, is largely a
craft of given forms, rooted in a process of ﬁnding rather than
83

What is a photograph?

In this essay he also claimed the fact that the photograph ‘is known
to be an effect of radiations from the object renders it an index and
highly informative’. What is unusual about photographs, though, is
not that they are indices; all signs are indexical of something –
speech is an index of a speaker; writing of a hand employing a pen
or moving over a keyboard; trafﬁc signs of both a fabricator and an
act of planning. What is particular, and peculiar, about photographs
is the conjuncture of resemblance and trace – the iconic and
indexical components of the sign coincide to a remarkable degree.
The resemblance of a photograph to its subject – the image – is a
direct and physical result of that subject and could not exist without
it. Photographs point to the objects that called them into being and
show us those things. As such, photographs bear witness to the
events and things they depict.

Photography

making. In important respects, photographs show us what
happened in front of the lens at a particular time in a speciﬁc place.
The arrangement of things as they appear prior to the exposure
being made is sometimes called the ‘pro-ﬁlmic event’. This
condition results in the principle of recognition in photographs,
which allows these images to function as documents. In one sense,
the argument for photographic realism is irrefutable: the police use
photographs to identify individuals because they record the
appearance of particular individuals; similarly photographs from
the family album were posted to try to locate lost family members
and friends after the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean or the al
Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center. In this sense, then, the
very process of photography, the chemical and optical trace of
objects, or the conjunction of iconic and indexical signs, lends
support to the common-sense view of photographs as literal or
objective copies (and to Bazin’s theoretical articulation of this view).
Even if we do not fully understand the processes involved, when we
look at photographs we realize that the image before us is tied to the
things it represents. Truth claims attached to photographs largely
turn on this recognition.

84

Chapter 5
The apparatus and its image

In H. G. Wells’s classic story ‘The Time Machine’, a voyager into the
future realizes that he possesses no evidence for his fantastic
journey. As he put it: ‘If only I had thought of my Kodak! I could
have ﬂashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second, and
examined it at leisure.’ This absent photograph from the caverns of
the Morlocks would also have provided proof for the sceptics in his
time; instead he had to make do with the, altogether less
convincing, memento of a faded, strange ﬂower found in his pocket.
As if to emphasize the evidential claim of photography present here,
in the recent ﬁlm version of The Time Machine, the time-traveller’s
camera (which he has remembered to pack) is shaken loose from his
grip by the violent motion of the time machine. The Kodak is left on
the ﬂoor in 1895 as the time-traveller lurches into the future.
‘The Time Machine’ provides yet another example of the belief in
the veracity of photographs. Nevertheless, there are plenty of
counter-examples to hand that should lead us to question this
belief. We know of numerous examples of photographs that have
been tampered with, mocked up, and rearranged in order to
mislead the unsuspecting. A few examples will have to do to make
the point. Amongst the most notorious is the Stalinist airbrushing
out of Trotsky, along with other erstwhile revolutionaries, from the
documents of the 1917 revolution. In this instance, photographs
were painstakingly altered to reinforce an ofﬁcial perspective. It can
85

Photography

be very difﬁcult to prove that photographs have been altered or even
set up. For instance, it took doubters decades to demonstrate that
the patently faked photographs of fairies made by two young girls in
1917 had indeed been fabricated. Even so, the experts still got their
facts wrong. As we will see at the end of this book, the advent of
digital images makes this kind of jiggery-pokery much easier. Closer
to our own moment, we know the internet contains a sub-genre of
‘photographs’ of ‘naked’ celebrities created by joining different
heads and bodies (as well as quite a few images of actual naked
celebs). The photo ‘sting’ – in which some prominent individual is
drawn into a compromising situation (usually involving sex, drugs,
or money) in order to be photographed – is also now familiar.
However, there is another class of images involving less overt
examples of manipulation or fabrication. For instance, it has been
suggested, both at the time and since, that a photograph taken by
H. S. Wong of the effects of the Japanese bombing of Shanghai
in 1937 was, in fact, posed. Wong’s picture depicts an isolated,
semi-naked infant crying amidst the smoky ruins of a railway
station. The photographer framed the scene so as to exclude other
people from his image and create a greater impression of isolation
and helplessness (we know this because another of Wong’s
photographs that is almost identical includes an adult attending to
another child in immediate proximity). He may even have moved
the child. In addition, it has been suggested that Wong introduced
the smoke. (At least some of these claims are plausible, but when
advocated by Japanese historians of a nationalist bent, they clearly
involve some axe-grinding.) In this instance, the question that
arises is: when does ampliﬁcation, or selection, become
falsiﬁcation? No sensible person could deny this bombing raid took
place, or even that it resulted in civilian casualties, and Wong’s
decision to exclude some people is the kind of decision
photographers make all the time: interestingly, the second image by
Wong that is used to cast doubt on this one also includes a dead
child draped over the railway track. Nevertheless, some people do
want to dispute the ‘truthfulness’ of this image. Arthur Rothstein’s
86

image of drought-stricken America, discussed in Chapter 2, is
another example of this kind. Which photographs are challenged as
‘untruthful’ is often a revealing symptom; sometimes more
revealing, or signiﬁcant, than the image in question.

Evidence is fundamentally a legal category. The current vogue for
television forensic science dramas is instructive here. In these
programmes, the police forensic team scrutinize a crime scene;
determine time and cause of death; detect evidence that is barely
visible or even invisible; and ﬁnd the traces that link a suspect to
the heinous events. It is noticeable, though, that these dramas
invariably end with arrest and confession, rather than trial, of the
suspect. In this sense, they provide a comforting vision of law and
natural justice. The court scene would be very different. Almost
every point of evidence introduced could be contested; other
experts would be called to suggest alternative interpretations from
those presented by the prosecution; lawyers would dispute the
conclusions drawn; and so on. Photographic, or video, evidence is,
likewise, always open to alternative readings. This evidence takes
shape in the process of claim and counter-claim.
In contrast to the previous chapter, which presented support for
87

The apparatus and its image

Even if we put these overtly manipulated cases to one side, there is
still a great deal of room for doubt and uncertainty when looking
at photographs. Does the image depict what the caption claims it
represents? What evidence is there to prove it was taken in a
particular place, or at a certain time? Does a photograph of one man
standing next to another imply a ﬁnancial connection, or an
intimate relationship, as the editorial line suggests? There is often
very little internal evidence in photographs to substantiate the
claims made for their content. In many cases, we have to rely on
the photographer’s, or editor’s, trustworthiness (or authority).
Whenever an issue is contentious, photographic evidence is likely
to be disputed by rival interest groups, political factions, or
whatever. Evidence is never simply in the photograph.

the common-sense belief that photographs are direct registers of
the things they represent, this chapter suggests, above all, that
photographs are pictures. At least among specialists concerned with
photography, this perspective has come to seem uncontentious,
even self-evident. These days, most people professionally engaged
in photography tend to assume that photographs possess no more
inherent evidential worth than pencil drawings. Our culture has,
though, tended to naturalize this kind of image. In the process,
viewers are liable to fall prey to some powerful ideological effects. In
this chapter, I am going to try to denaturalize photography, but I
think this is a starting point, and not the conclusion, for an
adequate account of photography.

Photography

Mirror images
At the heart of any criticism of photographic realism is the idea that
the apparatus embodies conventions and assumptions about
picturing. While the consequences of the staged, manipulated, or
mocked-up image are readily apparent, recognizing the deep
conventions underpinning the apparatus can be less
straightforward. However, these conventions are no less important
for a serious understanding of photographs; if anything, the relative
invisibility of these determining assumptions makes them more
worthy of attention and more insidious in their effects.
It might help to begin with the mirror ‘image’: not least because this
analogy runs throughout the history of photography, which is often
discussed as a ‘reﬂection’ of reality. In 1859, Oliver Wendall Holmes
went further and described photography as ‘a mirror with a
memory’: his metaphor implies that the photograph is a reﬂection,
but one that has been ﬁxed or frozen in time. In some ways, this is a
strong analogy: photographs do seem similar to reﬂections in
mirrors – faithful duplications of reality set beyond a glassy surface.
However, the comparison is, ultimately, misleading. One problem is
that we need to consider: in what sense is the thing we see in the
mirror an image at all? (Here, the word ‘image’ is used to suggest a
88

An analogy with natural vision underpins many assumptions about
photography. It is often said that the camera is a truthful recorder in
so far as it reproduces the working of the human eye. This
assumption frequently leads on to the related, ideological claim that
the camera is a ‘mechanical eye’. In this view, the photograph is
perceived to offer an objective record because it replicates vision
stripped of subjective interference. Whereas the camera had
traditionally been seen as an objective device, from the late 1960s
ﬁlm theorists and photo-historians began asking what kind of thing
the camera was, what presumptions it was built on. As the critic
Joel Snyder argued ‘it is ludicrous to believe that a photograph
captures images or records them’. His point is that there is no image
existing ‘out there’, which is seized by the camera: rather, the image
is produced by the camera. This sounds self-evident, but the
consequences are very signiﬁcant – camera-images are not lying
about in the world awaiting discovery. (A wide variety of possible
89

The apparatus and its image

depiction that resembles, or otherwise represents, things that we
know or imagine. It is difﬁcult to deﬁne an image, but one key
characteristic entails a distinction between actual and virtual
phenomena.) Assuming a good, ﬂat mirror with a clean surface,
there are three factors that enable a beholder to determine that
what they see is an image, and not reality itself. Firstly, the
bounding edge or ‘limit frame’ marks the reﬂection off from the
surrounding area. When looking at a mirror, we are aware of its
position in a ﬁeld; its edge produces a disjunction between the
reﬂection and the actual space that surrounds it. Secondly, viewers
know from their spatial position that the things reﬂected (including
the self looking) are located on this side of its surface; sometimes
this takes a moment to grasp and the effect can be quite
disconcerting. Nevertheless, the viewer sees that he or she cannot
be here and there. Thirdly, mirrors invert the objects they reﬂect. In
all other respects – principally, because they gather light across
their surface – mirrors reproduce the things in front of them in a
way that conforms to the characteristics of natural vision. Camera
images are of a different order.

images can be made from any subject.) Images belong to the realm
of culture and not nature. Far from accepting the neutrality of the
camera, during this period even the most automatic of cameras
(surveillance) came to be seen as a cultural apparatus imbued with
priorities and presuppositions. This concern dovetailed with the
wider interest of the time in the politics of technology.

Photography

Camera space
We now need to revisit the provisional account of the camera
presented in Chapter 4 and consider the cultural history of the
apparatus. The principal difference between camera images and the
image in the mirror is that the former – with or without a lens –
focuses light at one point. In so doing, the camera produces an
image that departs, in signiﬁcant ways, from natural vision. As we
have seen, in its essentials, the camera is just an aperture in a dark
box: more or less anything that restricts light will do (the artist
Lindsay Seers makes photographs using the inside of her mouth as
a camera). The application of a lens to this dark box is not
fundamental to the process, but it serves two purposes: ﬁrstly,
because a curved lens gathers light and focuses it at a point, it
maximizes the available light and speeds up the exposure; secondly,
the lens decreases the required focal length of the camera (the
distance between the aperture or surface of the lens and the ﬁlm
plane), enabling the size of the camera to be signiﬁcantly reduced.
We will need to return to lenses and their effects, but the basic point
here is that the architecture of the camera casts the photograph
within a particular history of images. Joel Snyder, who, I think, has
provided the most thoughtful account of the camera, suggests we
tend to see the history of this instrument from the wrong end. The
camera is frequently viewed as providing a conﬁrmation of the
principles of Western painting. Snyder suggests that the problem is
the exact opposite: the camera evolved (over a protracted period) to
reproduce the characteristic features of Western art. Pinhole
phenomena and the camera obscura had both been familiar to
90

optical experimenters for a long time, particularly in Arab
civilization, but it was not until the 16th century that they began to
be discussed in conjunction with pictures. The pictorial use of the
camera obscura belongs to a point after the basic conventions of
Renaissance painting had been consolidated. As Neil Walsh Allen
and Snyder have pointed out, the camera lens gives a circular image,
becoming more diffuse at its edges, but, very early on, photographic
cameras were ﬁtted with a square or rectangular viewing screen. In
conformity with paintings, drawings, and prints, this screen only
makes visible the central portion of this image. In trying to account
for this new type of image, photography’s experimentalists ﬁtted it
into the existing account of pictures.

(At a later point it will be necessary to ask what exactly is meant by
‘conventional’, because this is often simplistically equated with
‘arbitrary’.)
Perspective is said to have been discovered by the architect
Brunelleschi in c. 1415 and codiﬁed in Leon Battista Alberti’s
treatise On Painting of 1435–6. For Alberti, observers take the
measure of space through a series of visual rays connecting the eye
to particular bodies. (There is some dispute about whether Alberti’s
account has anything to do with ‘images’, but I am going to pass
over this.) He suggested that there were three types of rays: extreme
or extrinsic rays measured the edges or outlines of an object or
space; median rays ﬁlled this outline – Alberti seems to have
associated them with the perception of colour; the centric ray
touched the centre point of a plane and marked equal right angles
around itself. It is fascinating to imagine with Leonardo da Vinci
91

The apparatus and its image

The point to be grasped is that the Western picture is a conventional
construction and not a natural category. The system of ‘linear
perspective’ is at the heart of this kind of picture. Perspective has
been much debated and disputed, but we need to consider some of
its principles, because the camera obscura and the modern
photographic camera are predicated on them.

that ‘The air is full of an inﬁnity of straight and radiating lines
intersected and interwoven with one another without any
occupying the place of another’. Before we proceed, I must
acknowledge a problem. Twentieth-century physics has
demonstrated that there is no such thing as an individual light ray.
The behaviour of light is very complex; in some situations physicists
treat it as if it were an electromagnetic wave; in others, as though it
were a quantum particle. However, in neither case is light
assimilable to the independent, straight lines of perspective theory.
Most readers will be glad to hear that I am not going to elaborate on
this subject: in what follows, I use ‘light rays’ to refer to the ideas of
perspective theorists; in all other instances, I will simply speak of
‘light’.
Renaissance perspective was rooted in classical geometry and its
underlying assumption was that perception of the external world
92

took the form of a triangle or pyramid. As Leonardo put it: ‘By a
pyramid of lines I mean those which start from the surface and
edges of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet in a single
point.’ That point was situated at the eye. In this sense, vision was
like, to use an anachronistic example, a searchlight, sweeping across
space and isolating particular things; taking their measure. The
picture was envisaged as ‘a cut through this pyramid in some
deﬁnite space’ or ‘a certain cross-section of a visual pyramid’.

On the basis of this model, Alberti suggested: ‘First of all about
where I draw, I inscribe a quadrangle of right angles, as large as I
wish, which is considered to be an open window through which I
see what I want to paint.’ This metaphor of a window is central to
our conception of the Western picture – perspectiva is Latin for
‘seeing through’ – and has been carried over into photography. The
window metaphor effectively naturalizes the artiﬁce of the Western
picture, claiming for it the status of reality or, at least, of a perfect
duplication of reality. A window pane separates us off from the
outside world, but the transparent glass offers no barrier to our eye:
we look through the window onto a portion of the world. When we
add to this the window frame that demarcates a ‘view’, we can see
why this metaphor has had such a powerful effect. The Albertian
window suggests that the surface of the picture is transparent; the
picture frame, like the window frame, bounds, or contains, the
93

The apparatus and its image

In linear perspective, the illusion of recession is created by a
geometrical principle in which all perpendiculars, or orthogonals
(parallel lines at right angles to the picture plane, or ﬁeld of vision),
meet at a vanishing point (for horizontals that point is located at the
horizon). If we imagine a room depicted in this fashion, the interior
walls, which we presume to be parallel, appear to slant inwards and
decline in size along their top and bottom edges. This geometrical
model allowed artists to produce a convincing illusion of spatial
depth by plotting relative scales for bodies within a regular
geometric grid: the further an object was supposed to be from the
observer, the smaller it appeared.

prospect, but the view appears as a perfect re-presentation of the
things on the other side of the window. Leonardo summed up this
attitude well, claiming:
Perspective is nothing else than seeing a place or objects behind a
plane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the objects
that lie behind the glass are drawn. These can be traced in pyramids
to the point of the eye, and these pyramids are intersected by the

Photography

glass plane.

In some ways, however, what I have been saying is incorrect or, at
least, inexact, because the reality in question was not our modern,
empirically testable world, rather it was an ideal or abstract view
corresponding to the all-seeing eye of God. Nevertheless, as the
precepts of Renaissance perspective were carried over into the
modern world, the view through the window accrued the sense of
empirical reality.
In the words of Erwin Panofsky, the great historian of this system,
perspective conveys, above all, a new rational and rationalizing,
mathematical system of visualizing space: an ‘inﬁnite, unchanging
and homogenous space’. That is to say, perspective space is ordered
according to the logic of geometry: it was, Panofsky argued, not
‘given space, but space produced by construction’. The chequered
ﬂoor tiles that feature in so many Renaissance paintings can be seen
as the leitmotif of this rational construction, since they provide a
systematic illustration of the system itself.
If we look at Antonello da Messina’s painting St Jerome in His
Chamber of c. 1475, we will get some sense of these conventions in
practice.
This demonstration piece makes a display of many of the features
of the perspective system. Antonello set his St Jerome in the centre
of a large sweep of space, reaching from the objects on the
foreground window ledge to the mountains in the far distance. It is
94

The apparatus and its image

18. Antonello da Messina, St Jerome in His Chamber, c. 1475

worth observing that he is able to sustain an attention to detail, or
optical focus, across most of this space. Recession is principally
conveyed through linear perspective: the orthogonals meet at a
concealed vanishing point a little to the left of St Jerome’s head; the
overall space has a sense of a box-like construction. Panofsky said
that ‘like all Italian interiors, it is basically an architectural exterior
with the front surface removed’. But, unlike most Renaissance
95

Photography

painters, Antonello went out of his way to display this system.
He painted in the window frame, which has an imaginary status in
most other paintings: we can imagine climbing through it into the
space behind; the ﬂoor tiles, once again, codify this spatial system
by rendering the organizing orthogonals visible. They also help
clarify what it means to say that the system of linear perspective is a
conventional system. Complex ﬂoor patterns, like this, have been
reconstructed from their representations in paintings. In this sense,
perspective accurately conveys some information about the world –
in so far as it is a conventional system, it is not an arbitrary one, but
a system like its parent mathematics.
What is really important about Panofsky’s account is that he
argued that perspective was not a copy or literal re-presentation of
reality – he called it a ‘Symbolic Form’, meaning an organization
obeying speciﬁc cultural and historical values. There are two ways
to illustrate the conventional character of this system: the ﬁrst is to
compare it to other representational systems; the second involves
a contrast with natural vision. Panofsky explored both options.
Pre-Renaissance painting, along with painting developed in other
cultures, frequently follows a different set of rules to those pursued
by the Renaissance painters and theorists. It is tempting to ﬁnd
these other systems of art wanting in comparison with the art of
15th-century Italy, as though these artists tried to make works in
linear perspective but failed. However, these image systems are not
inadequate versions of Renaissance art: they embody a different
vision. For instance, while orthogonals often converge in preRenaissance art, they do so inconsistently: a picture frequently
contains a number of inconsistent vanishing points, or points of
convergence. It has been argued that the Russian Icon tradition
employs a system of inverted perspective, with the orthogonals
diverging in the picture – the point of convergence appears to be the
position of the spectator. (One account suggests that the point of
view in the Icon tradition corresponds to that of God or the Saint
looking out from the picture.) Works in the Chinese, Japanese, or
Persian traditions are not organized around a central vanishing
96

‘Natural vision’
The values embedded in the camera can be drawn out through
another line of inquiry, which entails contrasting the camera image
with ‘natural vision’. In doing so, there is a danger of setting up
natural vision as a standard against which to judge representational
forms. That is to say, it is tempting to regard any image that deviates
from the vision as a distortion of reality and hence as inadequate.
But, as we learn from Benjamin, photography provides a powerful
supplement to natural vision, enabling us to perceive things that
remain imperceptible to the ‘naked eye’. The value of a visual form
does not depend on adherence to, or departure from, human
perception. Nevertheless, because photography has frequently been
seen through an analogy with natural vision, it may be helpful to
outline some signiﬁcant distinctions. Paradoxically, I am going to
do this by focusing on a photograph that does attempt to reproduce
97

The apparatus and its image

point and do not always distinguish scale from foreground and
background. Panofsky’s own example was drawn from the art of
classical antiquity, which he believed revealed a psychophysiological conception of space, in marked opposition to the
coherent and rational space of the Renaissance. He suggested that
these pictures possessed no cohering centre or horizon; rather
they followed a different model of space which sustained discrete
points of attention. Spatial unity does not seem to have been
valued by these artists or their viewers. Panofsky claimed these
pictures were organized according to the way our bodies actually
relate to things in space: switching attention between this and that
in a discontinuous ﬁeld. Panofsky felt that Renaissance perspective
was neither natural nor inevitable; rather, it was the historical
product of a society that valued detachment more than
immersion; order rather than ﬂux; regularity instead of
discontinuity; and structure over experience. At this point, we
ought to be able to see that the modern photographic camera is
modelled on a particular rationalizing order of space (it inherits a
‘Symbolic Form’).

the conditions of perception following Helmboltz’s theory of vision:
P. H. Emerson’s A Stiff Pull of 1888.
Emerson, an advocate of Naturalism (a version of late 19th-century
art-photography), reacted against the prevailing taste of the period
and tried to model his images on the way a scene would actually be
perceived: A Stiff Pull is a good example. This image, in some ways,
differs from most photographs. The picture depicts the moment at
which two plough-horses reach the brow of a hill. But it ought to be
apparent that he has done a considerable amount of after-work on
negative or print. Notably, there is a very shallow depth of ﬁeld –
only a small portion of the image seems to be in focus (the plough as
it meets the earth and the patch of ground to the right). This is odd,
because even with a shallow depth of ﬁeld, we would expect the
point of focus to be the same across that plane. Emerson has worked
(probably on the negative with an abrasive) to ensure that
everything to the left of the plough is hazy. The effect is to direct
attention to a small segment of the image.

Some distinctions between human visual perception and the
camera image are obvious: i) the eye registers colour and light and
dark simultaneously, whereas black-and-white photography
records luminosity devoid of colour; ii) we perceive a shifting ﬁeld
and not a square or oblong framing edge; iii) human vision is
binocular, rather than monocular: looking with two eyes spaced
roughly 6 centimetres apart allows us to register spatial depth. This
has important consequences for looking at pictures, because
binocular vision enables us to see the ﬂat picture surface as well as
the depicted scene. (Even when looking into a mirror, we sense the
presence of a ﬂat surface.) Other aspects of visual perception might
be less apparent, but they are no less signiﬁcant. Firstly, human
vision focuses on a single plane rather than deep space (place your
ﬁnger before your eye and try to focus on it and a more distant
object simultaneously); we compensate for this with rapid eye
movement, which gives an illusion of continuous perception. Our
99

The apparatus and its image

As I have suggested, the eye has frequently been compared to the
camera obscura, and the photographic camera; in some ways the
analogy makes sense. Like the camera, light enters the eye (a dark
chamber) through a lens, the pupil acts as a diaphragm regulating
the amount of light admitted, casting an inverted image on the
retina. Pushing the analogy a little, we might even see the eyelid as a
shutter. In other ways, though, the comparison is quite misleading.
Our perceptual apparatus consists of three interlinked components:
the eye is only the ﬁrst of these. The optical image formed on the
retina is translated into chemical substances which transmit
information, via the optical nerve, to the nervous system of the
brain. Whereas the camera is designed to produce images, we do
not see the retinal image. Rather, what we experience is the outside
world as it is perceived in the brain: this involves, among other
things, turning the retinal image the right way up and
amalgamating two distinct ‘images’, each possessing their own
visual ﬁeld. Analogies between eye and camera take us so far, but
they involve separating the eye from its place in perception.
Isolated, in this fashion, we would have to say that the eye is blind.

Photography

eyes are constantly in motion (so are our bodies and heads),
resulting in a ﬂickering, jerky perceptual experience. As such, we
tend to observe discrete points of focus rather than a homogenous
ﬁeld (this relates to Panofsky’s point about pre-Renaissance
painting).
This is exacerbated by the perceptual process called foveation. The
fovea centralis is a particular indentation on the retina along the
axis of the eye’s lens, particularly rich in receptor cells: it is at this
point that the ‘image’ is ‘sharpest’. When we wish to see something
clearly, rather than move the eye, we turn our head; in this way, the
object under scrutiny lines up directly with the fovea. Perceptual
investigators call this the ‘point of ﬁxation’. As such, human vision is
marked by both central and peripheral ﬁelds of attention.
Peripheral vision is much less distinct than central vision, and
colour perception is considerably reduced there. Nevertheless,
peripheral vision plays an important role in perception, allowing us
to detect movement or the presence of objects; it is very important
for spatial manoeuvring and sensing potential hazards. We should
also note that spatial perception isn’t just visual: humans are
embodied creatures who orientate towards the world through our
bodies as well as visual prompts.
It ought to be apparent that Emerson’s attempt to model the
photograph on a particular conception of the retinal image was
quite batty (though, it is no worse as a picture for that). He isolated
a couple of features from the perceptual process (the distinction
between central/peripheral vision and the idea of selective points of
ﬁxation) and made these stand for perception. However, we look at
pictures in the same way that we see the world – with continuous
eye movements and shifts in the point of ﬁxation. Emerson could
not hope to mimic this in a still photograph. Effectively, he froze the
motion of the eye. Understanding this may help us to grasp the
tricky nature of perspective. If we return to the painting by
Antonello, or any photograph with an extensive depth of ﬁeld, we
can observe a contradiction: St Jerome in His Chamber conveys
100

detail across a vast expanse of space. The partridge in the
foreground, the columns, St Jerome’s book, even his lion set deep in
the picture, are all depicted with almost equal attention. But, as we
have seen, the human eye is incapable of holding focus across space.
The sleight of hand here is that we perceive these things in
equivalent detail because they are depicted on a ﬂat surface, which
our eye can focus on. The intense sense of depth and detail that we
experience in front of paintings or photographs is a result of their
ﬂatness.

‘Reality effect’
The photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson once described
photographs as the ‘meeting of an instant and geometry’. His point
is poetically put, but it captures something of photography’s
position at the juncture between contingent events and the rational
order of linear perspective. Part of the fascination of photographic
pictures is that they appear lifelike, but, somehow, much more so.
Looking at pictures is, in this sense, akin to dreaming or the drifting
consciousness experienced in moments of reverie. Advertising and
pornography clearly play off this odd condition somewhere
101

The apparatus and its image

One last point on perspective: theorists have long distinguished
between perspective naturalis and perspective artiﬁcialis (natural
and artiﬁcial perspective). In human vision orthogonals do appear
to converge in the distance (look along a railway track or up at a tall
building), and this gives a sense of diminishing size. This natural
perspective is based on angles of vision. The artiﬁcial perspective of
the Renaissance painters and the camera, on the other hand, is a
conventional system (organized around a central vanishing point)
designed for plotting diminishing scale on a ﬂat surface. In contrast
to human vision, linear perspective creates a geometric box-like
space. The powerful analogy between camera and eye has the effect
of naturalizing photographs and rendering it difﬁcult for us to see
them as pictures. Photographs are not reproductions of vision;
rather, they present information to vision.

Photography

between waking reality and dream or fantasy. Photographs – their
glossy surface and high key colour only adds to this – can seem more
real than reality: uncannily like the world we know, yet more
perfect, ordered, and coherent. One reason for this is that the
system of perspective, by encompassing the viewer into the visual
ﬁeld, makes him or her appear to be the singular recipient of the
information presented. Perspective images address each viewer in
exactly the same way and yet, at the moment we look into them,
everything appears designed ‘especially for you’ (this has been
characterized as an ‘individual effect’). The image seems to address
us as unique individuals, but it does this for every single viewer. It is
a space that seems particularly amenable to fantasy or ideology. The
proviso is that no one ideology – not even ‘individualism’ – spans
the period of the Western picture. It may be, for instance, that
perspective is conducive to historical thinking, or to grasping the
value-laden character of points of view. A perspective or point of
view suggests (if only negatively) the possibility of other places from
which to look, or the difference between here and there.
Let me return, one last time, to the correlation of eye and camera.
As we noted earlier, the camera cannot be viewed as a corroboration
of the Western picture; instead, it was designed to reproduce that
model. Lens conﬁgurations are instructive in this regard. There are
three basic lens arrangements available for the camera; each results
in a different kind of image. Lenses are measured according to their
focal length (the distance from their surface to the ﬁlm plane). One
lens type is usually designated as a ‘wide-angle’ lens (a focal length
of less than 35 millimetres). Lenses of this type allow a wider ﬁeld of
view and are particularly useful for photographing in conﬁned
spaces. Wide-angle lenses stretch space, increasing the sense of
depth (they are a real boon to estate agents). The second variety of
lens, typically referred to as ‘normal’ or ‘standard’ has a focal length
in the range from 35 to 55 millimetres. This lens is the one most
frequently ﬁtted to cameras. The third lens conﬁguration is usually
described as ‘telephoto’ and has a focal length in the range from
60 to 1,200 millimetres. (For ranges above this, the camera is
102

typically ﬁxed to a telescope.) Telephoto lenses allow distant objects
to be photographed as though they were nearby: in doing so, they
compress space, bringing widely separated objects into close
alignment. Obviously, the selection of lens type will have a
determining effect on the image. If a photographer intends to
suggest a relationship between two people (real or constructed), a
telephoto lens will convey this better than a wide-angle lens. But
over and above this, there are no prizes for guessing which of the
three lens types most closely mimics the human eye. In an
important sense, the conﬂation of camera and eye generates, to take
a term from ﬁlm theory, a ‘reality effect’.

Whereas advertisers, pornographers, and suchlike employ the
103

The apparatus and its image

The idea of a ‘reality effect’ was developed to describe the
ideological effect of a system of representation (ﬁlm) that is
sometimes confused with a literal copy of reality. In one sense, the
reality effect corresponds to Alberti’s window. Documentary
photography particularly trades on this effect, as do photography’s
fantasy forms. What we see is a highly conventionalized image, but
one that seems to copy reality: either because it shares some
characteristics with the objects or events depicted, or because it has
been naturalized over time. At the end of the 18th century, one
treatise on perspective suggested: ‘a Picture drawn in the utmost
Degree of Perfection, and placed in a proper Position, ought to
appear to the spectator, that he should not be able to distinguish
what is there represented, from the real original Objects actually
placed where they are represented to be . . . ’. We know that this idea
is fanciful – binocular vision alerts us to the presence of a ﬂat
surface – but it conveys something of the reality effect, which works
to conﬂute the gap between the object or event depicted and the
resulting image. Ideologues of all stripes have a vested interest in
the associated claim that ‘the camera never lies’. To be able to say
‘this is just the way it is’ or ‘but it was captured by the camera’ is a
very good way of masking highly contentious and interested points
of view.

reality effect to induce us to identify with commodities, some artists
have used it to quite different ends – to call attention to ideological
investments in images. The novelist W. G. Sebald, for instance,
regularly employed banal photographs to illustrate his odd
narratives and travelogues. However, on reﬂection, it seems most
likely that he invented elaborate scenarios and narratives around
found photographs (the pictures sometimes don’t seem credible as
illustrations). Sebald’s books employ our belief in the veracity of the
photograph to draw us into the narrative, while allowing the
moments of disjuncture and implausibility to pull us up short,
inducing us to reﬂect on the relation of image and text, or what is
said and what shown.

Photography

Frame
The frame plays a central role in photography, perhaps even more
than it does in painting. It may be helpful at this point to
distinguish between the ‘object-frame’ and the ‘limit-frame’. The
‘object-frame’ might be ornately carved and covered with gold
leaf, or a plain metal or wooden construction. In photography the
masked white edge of a print is also a frame of this kind. The
object-frame calls attention to the picture, isolates it from the
wall, and offers some protection against bumps and bangs, smudges
and ﬁngermarks. In contrast, the ‘limit-frame’ demarcates the
compositional edge of the picture. Limit-frames are compositional
devices separating inside from outside; picture from pro-ﬁlmic
event. As Szarkowski put it, ‘[t]he central act of photography,
the act of choosing and eliminating, forces a concentration on the
picture edge – the line that separates in from out – and on the
shapes that are created by it’. Whereas the painter ﬁts his or her
compositions into the selected canvas (often working with the edge
or limit-frame as a key point in the overall organization),
photographers work somewhat differently. The limit-frame in
photography is initially constituted by the edges of the ﬁlm plane as
it appears in viewﬁnder or glass screen. There is subsequently scope
to change this in the darkroom, by printing only a section from a
104

negative. In either case, the ﬁnal limit-frame coincides with the
edges of the photographic print.

We may be able to clarify the working of the limit-frame by looking
at a famous example from Alfred Stieglitz’s series, which he called
Equivalents.
The Equivalents are all just photographs of clouds. Stieglitz
intended these pictures to be interpreted as expressive correlates or
105

The apparatus and its image

In ﬁtting a contingent view into the limit-frame, photographs
isolate and focus attention on fragments of things. ‘Photography is’,
to cite Szarkowski again, ‘a system of visual editing. At bottom, it is
a matter of surrounding with a frame a portion of one’s cone of
vision, while standing in the right place at the right time.’
Whereas paintings are built up, photographs are extracted from a
visual ﬁeld. The best way to think about the limit-frame in
photography is as a kind of excision in space. This ‘cut’ extracts a
portion of space, while suggesting that it is a fragment of a much
larger ﬁeld of view. Changes can be made in the darkroom, but at
the initial stage photographic composition basically comes down to
deciding which portion of the pro-ﬁlmic event to include and how
exactly to deploy the limit-frame. This restriction has provided the
basis for images of a startlingly novel type. Conventional pictures
typically centre the principal subject and build the composition
around it; the camera, at least potentially, implies a ﬂuid framing
procedure and a limitless number of alternate framings.
Consciously, and unconsciously, 20th-century photographers have
made use of these possibilities by pushing the subject up to the
edge, leaving a central void (‘deframing’), or slicing through a
person so that only part of a ﬁgure appeared within the frame.
Heads are lopped off; hands or feet project into the picture from
beyond the depicted space; objects ﬁll the entire frame (close-ups);
two different bodies might be aligned and space compressed so that
foreign objects appear to sprout from the body (sometimes called
‘false attachments’).

equivalents for his feelings or states of mind, but this need not
concern us. What is striking about these images is the central role
played by the limit-frame in their production. In one sense, these
pictures are nothing but their frame: Steiglitz has created these
shapes and forms by using the frame to select and isolate a fragment
from the expanse of cloud and sky; imposing aesthetic order on
chaos. What we see only takes shape in the photograph. The
Equivalents were some of the ﬁrst self-conscious experiments with
photographic composition as a ‘cut in space’.
As we saw in Chapter 3, Szarkowski argued that this kind of
framing constituted one of the inherent properties of the
photographic medium. But the understanding of the
photographic frame and its implications needs to be seen in
historical perspective. Throughout the 19th century,
photographers employed the most conventional compositional
techniques, particularly centring whole ﬁgures. Even Stieglitz – in
106

the front rank of arguing for art-photography – prior to the
Equivalents, had conformed to the standard forms of
composition. This kind of framing is one potential way of using a
camera, but it is not the only one. Nevertheless, this kind of
procedure does highlight the role of the frame in making a
picture. The frame, whether used conventionally or not, is a
rhetorical device that makes connections where none necessarily
exist. Photographic meanings are often built from these
connections, and they play a very prominent part in the lexicon of
street photography. Doisneau’s Helicopters, Tuileries Gardens of
1972 is a good example.

Narrative
So far we have assumed that photographs produce meanings
independently of language; this is an abiding assumption
(associated with modernism), but it is seldom, if ever, the case.
Photographs invariably come coupled with headlines, captions,
titles, or descriptions. The half-tone screen, which enabled the easy
combination of photographs and words, entrenched this relation
and made the symbiosis of image-text a powerful cultural force.
Even when photographs are not provided with accompanying text
(sometimes on gallery walls or the odd advertisement), the viewer
brings experiences and beliefs with them; we ﬁt the image into
narrative contexts.
107

The apparatus and its image

The connection between the two key components of this image –
the helicopters and the statues caked in guano – is created by the
frame. These things are contingent and unrelated, but the frame
binds them together, establishing a powerful association. The effect
is to prompt the viewer to transfer the values of one thing to the
other. In this case, we can’t help feeling that the military ‘birds’ have
crapped on classical culture. With the choice of the frame, the
photographer actively makes the picture rather than simply
recording pre-existing things. Photographs unavoidably necessitate
the problem that H. S. Wong was criticized for.

21. Robert Doisneau, Helicopters, Tuileries Gardens, 1972

A number of artists have similarly experimented with newsphotographs shorn of their anchoring text. Sarah Charlesworth’s
Modern History of 1977–9 reproduces the front page of 45
newspapers from around the world. Charlesworth left the title of
the paper, but removed all other news copy. Each example includes
an image of Aldo Morro (at the time he had been kidnapped by the
Brigada Rosso). Frequently, this picture appears in incongruous
combinations with other images. In John Baldassarri’s video The
Meaning of Various News Photos to Ed Henderson I, of 1973, the
said Henderson is invited to describe news-photos cut from their
context and pinned up. The descriptions are remarkably
109

The apparatus and its image

The case of the news photograph is particularly instructive in this
context. Roland Barthes suggested that the caption ‘anchored’ the
image: that is to say, that the caption or headline tied the image
down to a preferred interpretation. The exhibition From the Picture
Press, curated at MoMA by Szarkowski in 1973, is revealing in this
regard. This exhibition consisted of press photographs stripped of
their captions and removed from the newspaper layout. Presented
in this form, the images seemed strangely ambiguous and formally
peculiar. In the process, Szarkowski intended to reveal the essential
formal characteristics or properties underpinning all photographs.
He systematically denied that photography was a narrative form
and repeatedly pointed to its lack of immediate legibility.
Photography, according to him, was an art of details and fragments
and not an art of storytelling. (One of the things that picture editors
do is combine images in striking juxtapositions or in sequences
which establish narrative threads. It is telling that photographers
have frequently complained that, in the process, their work is
misrepresented.) As a claim about photographic art, or for the core
condition of the medium, Szarkowski’s procedure is highly dubious:
From the Picture Press extracted instrumental press pictures from
the contexts and uses in which meaning is constructed. However,
his exhibition did have the virtue of demonstrating the semantic
vagueness of photographs not pinned down by caption and text. It
reveals, once again, that meaning is not simply in the image.

Photography

circumspect and the narrator often circles around, revising his
assessment of what he sees: in one instance, he seems unable to
decide if a man has been shot or has simply spilled his bag. His
descriptions are hardly convincing. In a related context, Larry
Sultan and Mike Mandel’s book Evidence, from 1977, culled 50
photographs from US government archives and presented them
without acknowledgment of their institutional context or any
textual information. Shown in this form, it is not at all clear what
the photographs are evidence of or for. These projects all reveal how
little we can rely on photographs when they are divorced from
supporting information or establishing contexts.
One way to envisage the difference between ‘art’ and ‘documentary’
in photography turns on this relation to language and narrative. In
the main, documentary is a closed form, designed to produce
preferred interpretations. As such, images are usually combined
with some form of anchoring text that steers the viewer/reader in a
particular direction. Photographic art, in contrast, typically abjures
words, or employs elliptical text, in order to leave the image open to
associations and interpretations. For art, vagueness or ambiguity
are often the preferred modes. Advertising can be seen as an
intermediate form that offers a certain amount of semantic play and
open connotation, but with the aim of transferring the associations
generated to the commodity being promoted.
In this sense, we can see why it is possible for newspapers with very
different editorial lines to sometimes employ the same dramatic
picture, because the caption is used to prompt a conclusion. The
morning after the US presidential election of 2004, one rightleaning British newspaper printed on its front page a picture of
George W. Bush and his family, which was much like all the others.
The image was accompanied by a headline that ran: ‘Family of
Scroungers’. In fact, this caption related to another story, featured
on the same page, about a British family who, it claimed, was
drawing extensive state beneﬁts. However, the effect was entirely
different: we can only presume that the subeditor was having a
110

laugh at the expense of the paper’s editorial policy. Switching
captions, or inventing new ones that suggest a different editorial
perspective, can be as instructive as it is often funny.

111

The apparatus and its image

It is, though, important not to carry this argument too far. It is one
thing to suggest that photographs are not a narrative form, or to
argue that the caption is essential to the editorial line, but it is
another to say that the image presents no evidence or corroboration
for events. Mandel and Sultan’s Evidence, Baldassarri’s video,
exhibitions by Szarkowski and Charlesworth can all help us to grasp
the processes involved in the production of photographic meaning,
but there is a danger that this approach can be over-extended. Art
trades on indeterminacy, but the demystifying works by artists can
lead to cultural and political myopia when transferred to other
contexts. An adequate account of photography must resist the
imperialism of art. In contrast, W. J. T. Mitchell reminds us that
when images are put into some relationship with words, the caption
can only retain some credibility if, in some sense, it corroborates
what there is to see.

Chapter 6
Fantasy and remembrance

Fiction
In his text ‘Digressions on the Photographic Agony’, written in 1972,
the artist Hollis Frampton posited the paradox of an imaginary
world recorded in photographs. Frampton narrates the discovery of
a huge ﬂoating sphere, which turns out to be the long-submerged
Atlantis. On investigation, the hollow globe contains just ballast
and a huge archive of old photographs. No one seems interested in
these images and they are dispersed – some to museums, some to
gather dust in middle-class attics – then a young PhD student
advances a startling hypothesis. The Atlantean repository is a ﬁctive
archive in which events, places, and people were staged, in order to
be photographed. Full-scale models of cities and an array of
historical characters were all created in this way. It turns out that
what the images represent is world history from 1835 to 1917, but
now that history takes on a strange and imaginary form, as though
it had never taken place, or had only ever existed as images. (This
conception is akin to the ‘replicants’ (artiﬁcial humans) in the ﬁlm
Blade Runner who are supplied with fake photographs as
corroboration for their implanted memories.) Presumably, because
this is Atlantis, the events were staged long before they actually
occurred.
When Frampton wrote this text it was a striking premonition of
112

The development of huge corporate image banks such as Bill
Gates’s ‘Corbis’ and ‘Getty Images’, which buy up photo archives and
commission stock images, are having an enormous impact on the
uses of photography.
These super-archives now constitute a multi-million-dollar
industry. The commercial ownership of historical image collections,
obviously, has signiﬁcant implications for the control of memory
and the representation of history; all manner of publications
increasingly draw their illustrations from these sources. The stock
pictures are all high-colour photographs, often digitally enhanced,
representing a perfect world ﬁlled with beautiful people, beautiful
places, and stunning light. Conﬂict is replaced with hedonism and
good teeth; commodities, like Venus, seem to spring, magniﬁcent
and fully formed, from the waves. Culture seems increasingly
colonized by an advertiser’s vision of a retouched world. In the light
of these developments, it is difﬁcult not to see Frampton’s story as
remarkably prescient. Photography now looks less like a copy or

what modern image-culture would become: after all, we now live
in a time when politics often appears little more than a string of
‘photo opportunities’. Politicians kiss babies, and visit hospitals or
schools, in order to be pictured as the kind of concerned people
who kiss babies, visit the sick, and show an interest in the future
generation’s education. We inhabit a culture so saturated with
media images that it hardly seems remarkable when a British
Home Secretary turns up (with a photographer) at a search for
‘illegal immigrants’, or when ‘smart bombs’ relay pictures of their
own spectacular and devastating impact. Staring out at us from
the tabloids and their glossy kin are photographs of people,
famous for nothing but being out and about. We know what it
means to watch people perform themselves for the camera. In
part, we understand this because we do it ourselves: striking a
pose or adopting a ‘look’. In these instances, photographs seem to
have become wrapped up with events, generating rather than
recording them.

trace than a total fabrication, or a ‘reality effect’ that purveys a ﬁctive
world.
In the past the predominant model of photography was drawn from
documentary, now advertising and its cognate publicity forms have
assumed the central role. These profoundly ideological images
demand serious attention, but some problems are likely to result if
we view the whole photographic ﬁeld through these fantasy
pictures. Attention to the ﬁctive constitution of photographs is
important because the common-sense conception tends to see only
the objects and people depicted in the image and overlooks both the
interventions of the photographer and the speciﬁc character of the
photographic apparatus. The resulting conﬂation of photographs
with the pro-ﬁlmic event leaves the viewer open to propaganda of
all kinds. Focusing on the cultural construction of meaning in
photographs can help us resist this effect. The feminist discussions
of Sherman’s pictures, or the work of contemporary artists, provide
useful models for thinking about a photograph’s ideological
connotations. There is a cost, though, and it may be overly high.
Sceptical views of the photograph always run the risk of ignoring the
114

particular forms of evidence embodied in photographs,
disabling memory and testimony. Frampton’s projection is good
fun, but, in one sense, it is a preposterous invitation to imagine the
horrors of world history as mere images. (Writers on photography
have been rather too keen to countenance such an idea in recent
years.)

In this instance, to deny evidential status to photographs seems
profoundly misguided, if not downright complicit with the
events depicted. The same point would stand for Holocaust
images and other photographic records of atrocities. While
there are very good reasons to be suspicious of the supposed
neutrality and objectivity of photographs, there is a danger of
throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. Opponents of
repression and exploitation around the world constantly need to

Fantasy and remembrance

The case of the ‘trophy images’ made by US military personnel
depicting the abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib
prison, and other locations, are highly signiﬁcant in this respect.
These pictures have been compared to pornography, but they seem
closer to tourist pictures. They are snapshots intended as private
memorials of victory and American superiority for the folks back
home. They proclaim: ‘look where I went’, ‘look what I did’. (It
strikes me as profoundly odd that they news media digitally
obscured the genitals in the published versions of these images,
as if that was the obscenity). However, once these pictures surfaced
they were taken as evidence of criminal acts and prosecutions
ensued. That is to say, the pictures are treated as independent
witnesses to these events. While these images may be pictures, they
are pictures of a peculiar kind that record the speciﬁc traces of
individuals and situations. No doubt, had they been able to do so,
the American and British authorities would have been only too
happy to dismiss these images as ﬁctions. In fact, they elected not to
dispute that prisoners had been severely maltreated – they accepted
the photographs as evidence - but to try to localise these crimes to
speciﬁc ‘bad apples’.

appeal to evidence on behalf of the victims of violence,
whether sponsored by states, corporations or private gangs;
photographs are likely to continue to play a prominent role in
contesting the effects of power. In my view, we need to bear this
argument in mind, when we consider the veracity of photographic
images.
116

The preceding two chapters placed a very different emphasis on the
interpretation of photographs. Chapter 4, following Peirce,
suggested that we view photographs as transcriptions or records of
a pro-ﬁlmic event. Chapter 5, in contrast, emphasized some of the
ways that the photographic image must be understood as a
conventional construction, embodying speciﬁc values and
priorities. Both of these perspectives are rooted in observable
features of the medium; there seems to be no simple way to
reconcile this contradiction.

117

Fantasy and remembrance

The artist Jeff Wall provided a good formulation for this
conundrum when he said that there are two prominent myths about
photography: the myth that it tells the truth and the myth that it
doesn’t. Wall’s characterization has the merit of capturing
something of the paradox involved in looking at photographs, since
these are images that do not seem to be images. Another
photographer, Allan Sekula, has suggested, however, that, at least
for intellectuals and media professionals, in the contemporary
ideological climate these myths do not hold the same cultural
weight: ‘[t]he old myth that photographs tell the truth’, he suggests,
‘has succumbed to the new myth that they don’t’. It is my argument
in this short introduction that the most productive way to view
photographs is to hang on to the contradiction or tension between
the two myths; to pay attention to the contradiction between the
pro-ﬁlmic moment and the form imposed on it by the photographer
and his or her apparatus. While photographs are copies of their
pro-ﬁlmic moment, they are never unmediated copies of it. As we
have seen, the apparatus is built on some deep pictorial
foundations. Photography is, then, always a doubled or paradoxical
form: the image is a transcription of a bit of the world and, at the
same time, a picture shaped by the determinants of the apparatus
and the choices made by the photographer. Maintaining this double
focus requires effort and attention; failing to do so gets the viewer
caught up in all sorts of problems.

Photography

Time and place
As we have seen, Peirce suggested that indexical signs are
linked to a deﬁnite time and place. In this sense, because of the
close correspondence between the indexical and the iconic
element, photographs depict a fraction of time. Even the
constructed photograph represents a deﬁnite moment. The events
we see in photographs happened, and the image stands as
testimony to their occurrence. As a number of observers have
noted, the time objectiﬁed in photographs is, though, strangely
paradoxical because the things and events we see in photographs
have already happened. As Roland Barthes, in a highly inﬂuential
account, argued: ‘[t]he type of consciousness the photograph
involves is indeed truly unprecedented, since it establishes not a
consciousness of the being-there of the thing (which any copy
could provoke) but an awareness of its having-been-there’.
Photographs, he said, conjoin ‘the here-now with the there-then’.
The image may display the ‘decisive moment’ of a car crash, an
execution, or climax of a sporting event, but the occurrences
represented have already taken place. The vehicle is now in a
scrap yard, the man or woman in the grave, and the race won or
lost.
For many commentators, this peculiar temporal conundrum – the
condition of simultaneously being of the past and appearing in the
present – deﬁnes the photograph as a melancholic form that, above
all, conveys death and loss. The hubris of photography can be
exempliﬁed by the encounter with old photos in a junk shop. This
encounter with congealed memories – the happy moments of festive
days – often induces a kind of melancholy recognition in which
dog-eared images take their place along with all the other detritus
of lives past. An old daguerreotype of a butterﬂy collector has always
fascinated me in this regard. This portrait records a man proudly
displaying his valued collection. But we realize that he now
represents for us what a prized butterﬂy was to him, a dead
specimen under glass. Barthes associates the photograph with
118

‘trauma’, ‘wound’, and ‘death’, while Bazin identiﬁes it with
‘embalming time’; writing in 1840, the eminent British scientist Sir
David Brewster used this same image of embalming to account for
photography. For these writers, even the most happy and innocent
photographs – perhaps especially the most happy and innocent –
function as a kind of memento mori for the viewer’s own death,
reminding him or her that all things pass and fade; that life is just a
snapshot.

Despite the inﬂuence of this argument, this melancholic conception
is open to dispute. If photographs encapsulate the peculiar
temporal paradox of here-now and there-then, by deﬁnition, this
condition must work both ways round: as much as the image
conveys something of death, reminding us of the unstoppable
passing of time, it simultaneously brings a moment from the past to
life for us, ‘blasting’ it up in the present, as Benjamin would have
said. Benjamin is important in this context because, in contrast to
Barthes, he was committed making the past active in the present.
Benjamin was concerned to recapture the past from the ‘victors’
who normally deﬁne history. For him, nothing in the past had truly
119

Fantasy and remembrance

There is, though, an important consequence of Barthes’s inﬂuential
account of the experiential time in photography that is rarely noted:
his account isolates the present from the past. So, he writes of one
photograph ‘I shudder over a catastrophe which has already
occurred’. This perspective has the effect of creating a safe distance
between himself and the depicted events, but at the cost of blocking
the image from entering into our time. (‘Trauma’ seems the wrong
image for this vision, because trauma is precisely typiﬁed by an
inability to leave the past behind.) Barthes works overtime in his
book Camera Lucida to deny the photograph any possible efﬁcacy
in the present: ‘[t]he photograph does not call up the past’ and it
does not ‘restore what has been abolished (by time, by distance) but
to attest to what I see existed’. According to him, the photograph ‘is
without future’. For Barthes, the photograph acts as a reminder of
the passing of things.

Photography

disappeared forever; its traces could be rediscovered and put to
use. It seems important, in these dark times, to emphasize this
possibility that the image can bring past events to life for
contemporary viewers; to stress its ability to testify, or to bear
witness, for us.
Photography is often spoken of as intimately wrapped up with
remembrance: Holmes’s ‘mirror with a memory’ is a good example,
while an advertisement for Kodak suggested scenes could be
captured ‘which would otherwise fade from memory and be lost’;
one recent advertisement on the London Underground
recommends that photographs stored on a computer should be
printed on (the company’s) permanent paper to avoid the risk of
losing precious ‘memories’. From the outset, photography was seen
as a privileged vehicle for acts of remembrance. Photographic
portraits were handed out to family, friends, and acquaintances;
memorial pictures were taken of those who had recently died; and,
then as now, people carried photographs of loved ones with them. A
photographic likeness seems to have the effect of bridging distance
and heightening the effects of memory, reminding us of those who
are absent.
The photograph seems to testify that particular people existed or
that things actually happened and to recall us to these moments. In
this sense, Barthes’s argument for consigning photographs to the
past is counter-intuitive. Memory is, after all, a trace or impression
of the past that takes place in the present. While his account may be
no worse for shaking up some common-sense perceptions, it does
seem that there is a case to consider here. In our amnesic culture,
Barthes’s refusal to allow the past into the present seems strangely
complicit with society’s current drive to forget.
Marcel Proust’s idea of involuntary memory, elaborated in his great
novel Remembrance of Things Past, may be helpful here. Proust
aimed, and in this, at least, he was at one with the Symbolist
movement of his time, to capture a past moment in all its fullness.
120

If Proust seems over-invested in the restored presence that
photographs conjure up, his sense of memory captures something
signiﬁcant about our experience of photographic images.
Photographs provoke acts of memory recalling us to things, places,
and people. They establish connections across time and space,
inducing chains of association. What will be dredged up in
memory’s driftnet cannot be predicted in advance: an item of
clothing or décor in a picture can spark connections and
associations. This may be why discussions of family photographs
rarely dwell on the images themselves. This absence of address to
the images can seem like a lack of attention, in the face of the
121

Fantasy and remembrance

Proust contrasted the inadequacy of ‘voluntary memory’, in which
we consciously try to recall the past, to ‘involuntary memory’, which
ﬂoods through us as a response to some unexpected stimulus.
Voluntary memory, he felt, was always frustrated in its goal,
whereas the unwilled memory could be more successful in
capturing a moment of past time. His classic example of involuntary
memory records the way that the taste of a ‘petite madeleine’ (a
small cake) dipped in tea called up, for his narrator/character
Marcel, long-forgotten people and situations. Proust was fascinated
with photographs, and they ﬁgure repeatedly in his writing. For
him, photographs provide a key stimulus for involuntary memory,
which, as the photographer Brassaı̈ put it in his book on Proust and
photography, ‘can exert a power as if they were actual living
persons’. The photograph of his grandmother, for instance,
‘torments the narrator’, while that of Albertine (Marcel’s object of
desire) ‘provokes jealousy’, and so on. Proust’s sense of the
photograph runs counter to Barthes’s account of the experience of
photographs as memorial. (If anything, Proust tended to collapse
the distance between the photographic image and its model, as if
the picture could restore the presence of the absent person.) Marcel
notes of his grandmother: ‘The great fact we must try to remember
is not that photographs . . . seem to make us believe that she is still
here, the great fact we must try to remember is the contrary: she no
longer exists.’

Photography

pictures: it as if the banality of their form blocks concentration – a
view captured by an old Monty Python sketch: ‘[t]his is me in front
of the house; this is me at the side of the house, but you can still see
part of the front of the house; this is me at the side of the house; this
is me at the back of the house, but you can still see part of the side of
the house’. We have all been there – oh no, not the holiday snaps! In
fact, this seeming distraction is probably a characteristic of the
particular memory effect generated by these pictures. Photographs
act as prompts or provocations for stories and reminiscences.
Acts of memorization spin off from these powerful points of
association.
The classical site for this kind of storytelling as memory is the
family album, which became commonplace during the 1860s,
but is now as likely to exist as packets or envelopes held
together by an elastic band, or a number of computer ﬁles.
Family photography is a much larger topic than I have scope
to address here, but it is instructive in a number of ways.
Firstly, it seems that memory emerges when the image is used
in a particular social network – in this case, a family gathering.
Memory connects with the image or ‘sparks’ from it: ‘Who is
this? That’s Aunt X. Sad story that one . . . . ’ Secondly, these
narratives are not unstructured. It is worth observing that
while it is usually men who take family pictures (initially
professional photographers and later, when camera
technology became simpler and widely available, as amateurs),
women typically act as the gatekeepers of family memory.
Mothers and grandmothers take charge of the album; they
arrange it, store it, and bring it out for display and discussion.
And as Annette Kuhn suggests: ‘Family photographs are
quite often deployed – shown, talked about – in series: pictures
get displayed one after another, their selection and ordering
as meaningful as the pictures themselves.’ Thirdly, what is
omitted from this collection is as important to these structured
memories as what is included. As Jo Spence – photographer
and critical navigator of the medium’s uses – pointed out, the
122

24. Jo Spence

Spence argued that the family album memorialized high days and
holidays, important rites of passage, but it left out funerals and
divorces, illness and family feuds. Perhaps, even more importantly,
the album presents a vision of the family as a sealed unit impervious
to public events or social upheavals. The tight focus of the family
album, encouraged by photographic manufacturers, falls on the
cycles of family reproduction: weddings and ceremonies associated
with greeting new children into the world, coming-of-age rituals,
holidays and family gatherings, prized possessions, and so forth.
Occasionally, a male relative may appear in military uniform, but
public events rarely impinge directly on the experience of everyday
life as it is depicted in the album. Even work is largely absent,
though it may sometimes ﬁgure through an image of the work’s
party or outing. In this sense, the album embodies a particular
ideology of the family as personalized space, organized around
female experience.
123

events chosen for commemoration in the album are highly
selective.

Some recent commentators have used the category of ‘memory
work’ to interrogate the operations of memory and its
connection to photography. Memory work (the allusion is to
Freud’s interpretation of dreams, or ‘dream work’) does not assume
that memories, or the related question of photographic
remembrance, are direct reﬂections of the past. As Kuhn suggests:
‘memory work undercuts assumptions about the transparency or
the authenticity of what is remembered, treating it not as ‘‘truth’’
but as evidence of a particular sort: material for interpretation, to
be interrogated, mined for its meanings and its possibilities’.
Memory work revisits the past critically, examining the way
memories are presented, and pays as much attention to what has
gone unsaid as what is explicitly proclaimed. This enterprise, which
is probably best seen as a critical form of autobiography,
interrogates the life story as a story, and the emphasis is on the
construction of the account, on ﬁctionalization, omissions and
occlusions. Spence’s own interrogation of the photographic album
and family memory in her writing, photographs, and photo-therapy
sessions (in which she and others restaged the occasions and events
occluded from the album) represents one important contribution to
this project of memory work; Kuhn’s interrogation of gender and
class memories through photographs in her book Family Secrets is
another. But it would be a mistake to conﬁne this engagement with
the family album to specialist re-interpreters of memory. Key events
may be absent from the pictures collected in the album, but the
discussion and storytelling that go on around it – the occasion of
family memory – does, to some extent, raise and address these
issues.
Whereas family photographs provoke memories shared by a
handful of close friends or relatives, photographs can also tap into
collective or ‘popular’ memories, recalling the viewer to events
experienced by wider social groups. Family memory typically
focuses on the rounds of everyday life, but collective memory
speaks to those public events that have been experienced by large
numbers of people. The contents of collective memory relate to
124

There is no doubt that memory is an active process, constructing
the past in the present, selecting and reshaping it according to
current preoccupations. Neither is it disputable that photographs
sometimes displace memory or substitute for it. We know that
many of the iconic images of the American Civil War, taken
under the auspices of Mathew Brady, involved carefully
rearranged corpses or assistants posed as dead troops; the equally
iconic image of three American soldiers raising the ﬂag on Iwo
Jima was staged for the camera (one of the soldiers has expressed
his unease at the use of this picture); Capa’s death of a
Republican soldier may (or may not) have been staged; while the
memories of those who lived through the London Blitz often
125

the world historical events that disrupt everyday life: wars,
revolutions, invasions, occupation and liberation; economic
upheavals; ‘natural disasters’ like earthquakes and ﬂoods; and
so on. But this kind of memory can also include shared celebrations
encompassing everything from national anniversaries to a
sporting occasion. Photographic images play as signiﬁcant a
role in shaping public memory as they do in family memory.
These images often allow us to make sense of an event and to
ﬁx a particular image of it. The photographs that take on this
role often articulate some shared experience or need.
Nevertheless, this does not mean that collective remembering is
necessarily productive of social coherence. Photographs can call up
very different perspectives on the past for the distinct groups
involved in those events. For instance, war-time occupiers and
those whose cities were occupied are unlikely to respond in the
same fashion to a photograph of tanks on the streets. The memories
elaborated on the basis of photographs are productive of social
division and conﬂict just as easily as social coherence. Which
photographs stick often depends on how they crystallize a
particular view of events. Even some of the most iconic
documentary pictures taken during wars or periods of economic
depression are frequently dismissed as tendentious by one camp or
another.

Photography

seem like descriptions of the documentary images that appeared
in Picture Post or scenes from the ﬁlm Fires Were Started.
Sometimes photographs are set up in order to deliberately
mislead viewers; often they are posed, or rearranged, for ease of
production or to increase the visual impact. Sometimes images
are so powerful that they seem to replace events themselves in
memory.
In fact, we usually witness the most important political and social
events through images. In most instances, the historic events that
shape our lives, and which constitute the stuff of memory, are not
directly experienced by many individuals; nevertheless, we
encounter these events via documentary pictures (and interviews
with those who did witness them). It is one of the most
revolutionary implications of photography that we do not need to
have been present at a particular event to bear witness to it. Even if
we have never visited a famine-stricken area or a war zone, we have
some sense of the effects of these things on those that are forced to
live through them. We should remember that these events are
mediated to us by images – typically those subject to famine
conditions are portrayed as passive victims – but at the same time,
the paradoxes of index and trace, of then and now, which we have
seen at work in photography, provide a foundation for memory and
recognition. This suggests that an analytical division may be
helpful: whereas memory entails association built on personal
experience, testimony can involve events with which individuals
have had no ﬁrst-hand encounter but have access to through
documentary records. Both memory and testimony involve forms of
witnessing.
Chris Marker – who has been described as ‘memory’s greatest
ﬁlm-maker’ – is an important point of reference here. Marker’s
ﬁlms represent some of the most powerful reﬂections available on
photography, memory, and history. Marker regularly bases
his reﬂections on political memory on photographs or ﬁlm clips.
As Catherine Lupton notes, in the ﬁlm If I Had Four Camels, he
126

employs as a device the ‘familiar, even banal act of leaﬁng through
a collection of photographs in the company of friends,
seizing on images that attract attention, and weaving anecdotes,
interpretations and arguments around them’.

As I have suggested, it may help to distinguish between
photographic memory and photographic witnessing or testimony.
The terms, it should be said, are not stable or easily separable.
Nevertheless, there is a signiﬁcant point to be made about types of
memory and an arbitrary division between overlapping categories
will have to be made for ease of exposition. In a ﬁlm like Sunless,
many of the events contemplated by Krasna/Marker were not
witnessed ﬁrst hand. They come from the work of other
photographers and ﬁlm-makers. But Marker treats these
representations as testimony of the episodes in question. He is
prepared to work over these images, to question the manner in
which they depict particular events, to raise what they leave
127

Fantasy and remembrance

In an epigraph to Marker’s ﬁlm The Last Bolshevik, George Steiner
observes ‘it is not the past that dominates us, but images of the
past’. Or, as Marker has his surrogate Sandor Krasna put it in
Sunless: ‘I remember that month of January in Tokyo, or rather I
remember the images I ﬁlmed of that month of January in Tokyo.
They have substituted themselves for my memory, they are my
memory.’ Marker’s ﬁlms are dense with references of this kind;
with musings on images substituting for knowledge of events. There
is clearly an important point here. But this does not mean that
memory is blocked by photographs. Marker advocates a form of
Proustian memory (interestingly, he observed in his CD-ROM
project Immemory that the central female character in Hitchcock’s
Vertigo, a ﬁlm that turns on memory and trauma, is called
‘Madeline’). Marker’s works are striking projects of memory work,
labouring over the revolutionary turmoil of the 20th century,
speculating on representation then and now, on memory and
forgetting. His work remembers the present, from the position of a
not yet realized future.

Photography

invisible, to point to moments of amnesia and so forth, while at the
same time regarding the pictures and ﬁlm as structured testimony.
A photograph of mass graves, torture victims, or famine acts as
evidence of things that some would wish covered up. In Barthes’s
sense, these pictures place us before these events, but (pace
Barthes) in doing so they can challenge us to face these horrors, to
remember them, and to act.
There is a public recognition that the saturation of mass media
pictures of traumatic events may have the opposite effect: the sheer
number of these pictures can generate a sense of dumb resignation
and hopelessness (‘the poor are always with us’). It is also plausible
to argue that photographs of this type can encourage forgetting as
attention is displaced from one image to the one that inevitably
follows. In this sense, the idea that photographs place us before
these events is only half of the story. The effect of these pictures
relies, just as much, on our not being there when these horriﬁc
things occurred. The news image offers viewers a safe perspective
on dangerous events, making them bearable. Nevertheless, while
this distance might neutralize the depicted trauma, it can also
provide a critical vantage point from which to examine and
contemplate it (immersion in a dangerous situation doesn’t offer
much scope for reﬂection). Proust described photography as an
‘encounter extended’ or as a ‘prolonged encounter’. This detached,
contemplative vision can generate passivity and helplessness, but it
can also provide the critical distance and moral indignation
required for action. Which option is taken is not an inherent
property of the picture, but of the public discourse mobilized
around it; of how it is put to work. In this sense, the trace of light
recorded in the photograph can attest to some harsh realities and
put the viewer in a place where ethical or political choices are called
for.

128

Afterword: Digital
photography

In this book I have deliberately left the question of digital
photography to one side and focused on chemical or analogue
photography. But digital photography has been around for some
time and there is now an extensive debate concerned with the
impact of digital technology on traditional conceptions of the
medium. Some commentators argue that the new technologies
represent a continuation of the key themes and practices associated
with chemical photography; others suggest that the introduction of
digital photography constitutes a radical break with the past. For the
latter, the ideas presented in this short introduction may appear as
period arguments of little relevance in the contemporary world.
Unquestionably, digital technology has had an enormous impact on
photography, changing the ways that images are made, stored,
circulated, and used. It has also become relatively ubiquitous: when
these technologies ﬁrst appeared they were ferociously expensive
and conﬁned to a handful of wealthy institutions and specialists;
now digital cameras are often built into quite standard mobile
phones. In what follows, I am just going to sketch some basic points.
Digital photography developed some 30 years ago as a requirement
of space exploration. Essentially, technicians faced the problem of
how to send images across vast distances: there is no point
dispatching a probe to photograph Saturn’s rings if it subsequently
drifts off into deep space with the ﬁlm remaining on board. A
129

Photography

system had to be found for recovering the images by transposing
them into information capable of transmission via radio waves. This
problem was solved by translating visual information into a binary
computer code (ones and zeros): hence the term ‘digital imaging’. In
this process, the image we see is made up from a myriad of picture
elements, or ‘pixels’, each of which contains particular information.
A good way to envisage this technology is to imagine a grid
superimposed over a conventional photograph. Each component of
the grid, or pixel, holds information on luminosity and/or colour. In
this way, an image can be generated either by translating a
conventional photograph into digital information via a scanning
device, or directly with a digital camera. In some respects, digital
photographs are similar to television images: TV screens are also
made up of lots of individual picture elements, which are activated
through broadcast transmission. There is no permanent image on a
television screen: the picture changes in response to impulses
switching individual pixels on and off. To ﬁx these images, they have
to be recorded on ﬁlm or magnetic tape.
So far, there is nothing particularly contentious in this account.
However, in one fundamental aspect digital images differ radically
from all previous photographic forms. Conventional photographs
register intensities of light through the physical changes in
chemicals (typically silver), but digital images result when light is
electronically translated into a code. The consequence of this is that
each individual pixel can subsequently be transformed by altering
the code. Initially, doing this involved computer programmers
entering complex algorithms into a computer, but now programs
are readily available that allow changes in the image to be made
through a series of simple commands. At the touch of a button (or a
keystroke), a colour image will shift to sepia tone. More
fundamentally, to give just a couple of examples, an edit facility
allows images to be compiled, almost seamlessly, from multiple
sources – a landscape from here, a person from there, another from
somewhere else. A cloning tool (which enables users to copy a
section of an image and repeat it) means that unwanted features
130

can be removed and replaced, leaving little evidence of the former
presence. These changes leave virtually no trace in the ﬁnal image.
One commentator has, rather graphically, suggested that this
technology allows editors ‘to reach into the guts of the image and
manipulate it’. As we have seen, photographs have always been
‘manipulable’: the choices made by the photographer play a large
part in determining what appears and how it appears, treatment
with a brush or montaging elements allows existing images to be
changed, but the new technologies make all this much easier.
Stalinist censors had to go to a great deal of trouble to remove the
likes of Leon Trotsky from photographs; this kind of intervention is
now much more straightforward.

131

Afterword: Digital photography

Two more factors need to be registered here. Firstly, digital images
do not necessarily have a ﬁxed, original form. It is possible to save
these images, just as you save computer ﬁles, on some memory
device, but this is not necessarily how they are used. A photograph
can be emailed directly to an editor, or other client, who might
rework it on a computer, before printing or circulating it. The image
can appear in a range of different forms and it is not easy to
establish its initial source. In contrast, chemical photography – in
principle at least – allows us to check an image against the negative
from which it was printed. Of course, this is not foolproof, but it
does offer a way of detecting subsequent changes to an image. The
absence of a negative can itself be suspicious. It is also possible to
identify physical changes to the emulsion of the negative or print,
but a pixel is just a pixel. It can be impossible to tell if a digital
image has been altered. Secondly, computer-generated images that
mimic the appearance of photographs are now created from scratch
on a computer. In this way, it is possible to create ‘photographs’ of
things that have no independent or prior existence. This technique
is increasingly used in action and fantasy ﬁlm-making. Generating
images in this form still requires a great deal of specialist labour;
some surfaces are more easily imitated than others – currently,
computer-generated humans tend to look like mannequins. It is a

Photography

matter of some dispute whether existing shortcomings can be
overcome with increased computing power.
The digitalization of photography has changed not only the means
by which photographs are made, but also the way that they can be
stored and circulated. Digital photographs are eminently suited to
storage on computer memory devices, and it is now a relatively
simple task to produce complex narratives in which pictures appear
in sequence, often in dissolves, and to provide accompanying sound
tracks or to overlay type. These edits can be stored and viewed on
computers or displayed via data projectors; alternatively, they can
be posted in cyberspace. Techniques like this mean that a large
number of people now have access to relatively professional forms
of display. The New York Times recently observed that US soldiers
had edited photographs and music to create memorial
presentations for comrades killed in Iraq. (Interestingly, ofﬁcers
insisted on ensuring they featured nothing contentious.) The home
computer is increasingly replacing the album as the preferred
storage site for family photographs; these pictures can be simply
stored this way or edited into more complex family memories. The
web means that digital images can be publicly circulated without
signiﬁcant recourse. The internet is now awash with sites
containing photographic presentations made by individuals or
small groups. This relative ease of distribution makes ofﬁcial
control of images very difﬁcult.
With the exception of computer-generated pictures, none of
these distinctions between digital and chemical photography
are clear-cut. More than some people want to admit, chemical
images conform to most of the features singled out as
properties of the digital image – photographs have never been
direct copies of their pro-ﬁlmic event. Indeed, it may be that
digital pictures serve, retrospectively, to emphasize just how
conventional all photographic images actually are. Nevertheless,
the advent of digital imaging has placed a question mark over
photography.
132

Techno-Utopians tend to see information and communication as
inherently positive and ignore the social relations of technology;
they pass over inequalities of power and wealth, and they assume
the processes involved are neutral. However, huge corporations and
wealthy individuals have the resources and political inﬂuence to
impose their agendas. Currently, private corporations are lobbying
hard to turn the internet into a proﬁtable and restricted business. In
contrast to the utopian vision, doom and gloom merchants view the
effects of the new image technologies with near-apocalyptic dismay.
Digital images, they argue, entail the end of photographic ‘truth’;
they subject us all to endlessly circulating falsehood and fantasy. We
are told that the world is now so awash with images that nothing
can really be absorbed or tested. In these conditions, technodystopians argue, everything is spectacularized; attention deﬁcit is
generalized; military vision normalized.
Yet, images now circulating on the web clearly play a role in
challenging the very features characterized as essential to this new
technical universe. While digital encoding makes certain things
133

Afterword: Digital photography

Reactions to these changes tend to come in both utopian and
dystopian forms. Techno-Utopians view digital photographs as a
component of the ‘information revolution’, which they see as
democratically empowering. The argument here is that this
technology now makes access to information (in this case images)
easy for everyone, while enabling people to use this information in
ways previously unimaginable. At its wilder edges, this argument
shades into science ﬁction, suggesting that we are all about to
become cyborgs with cameras and memory chips implanted in our
eyes or brains – literally, creating a photographic memory. In more
restrained mood, the champions of digital technology point out that
anyone can now produce and distribute pictures freely on the web.
It is worth noting, though, that large sections of the world’s
population don’t have telephones or even electricity, let alone the
ability to generate and circulate images. Access to technology is as
unequal as access to any other kind of resource.

Photography

possible, and rules others out, both sides of the argument tend to
neglect the fact that what we actually do with this technology is not
ﬁxed at the outset. The uses of technology always exceed what was
initially envisaged for it; what a technology becomes is usually the
result of conﬂicting interests attempting to cast it in their own
image. Some people have a greater ability to determine the outcome
of this struggle for deﬁnition than others, but they do not have it all
their own way and the ﬁnal form is not pre-given. The new
technology could enhance the democratic circulation of
information, or be channelled into restricted commercial forms; it
could allow people to enter directly into the production of meaning,
or position them as relatively passive recipients of representations
authored by a small coterie of media professionals. At the moment,
we are in the middle of a maelstrom when all of these things seem to
be taking place simultaneously.
This is not to say that the new photographic techniques are not
having an immediate impact. For instance, documentary
photography is facing a mounting crisis. The emergence of digital
technology, which allows for the manipulation of images without
leaving any evidence of the intervention, poses a fundamental
challenge to traditional notions of documentary evidence. In one
sense, as I have argued, this belief in unmediated access to reality is
misguided, but, nevertheless, this challenge has called into question
the self-image of the documentary photographer. In part, the crisis
is of a longstanding nature: we are long past the time when
photographs possessed much novelty value; now documentary
photographers’ wares take their place alongside ﬂashy commodities
clamouring for attention; the decline in picture magazines has also
removed a key base of support. However, technological changes in
the media are undoubtedly having a profound impact. It has been
estimated that one-third of news photographs now come from
‘video grabs’ (single images extracted from video). This is often the
preferred image source for many editors of newspapers and
magazines. The media’s preference for digitally produced
photographs that can be quickly emailed to the publisher often
134

strips photographers of an archive of negatives (a key economic
recourse). In addition, images recorded by bystanders with cheap
digital technology can sometimes substitute for professional
images. Many documentary photographers now ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
obtain assignments or place their images.

135

Afterword: Digital photography

At the same time, though, the combination of digital photography
and the internet is opening up new possibilities for the use of
images. Things may change in this respect, but at the moment the
internet allows access to all manner of images and makes it
relatively easy for groups or individuals to circulate photographs in
innovative and critical ways, which would previously have been
unavailable or difﬁcult to view. While it is clogged with amateur
porn sites, neo-Nazi propaganda, and billions of sales pitches, the
web is also an arena for critical projects, artists’ interventions, and
‘unofﬁcial’ witness pictures. For those who are interested,
photographs can be accessed form all parts of the world that that
have not been ﬁltered for conformity with the approved
perspectives of governments or business concerns. For every tourist
brochure there is now an activist site decrying the impact of
economic development on the local environment and indigenous
people. While the established news media appear increasingly
locked into permitted ‘safe zones’ around the world, alternative
sources of information are all readily available to those who have a
computer and a phone line. At a time when the ofﬁcial media seems
increasingly part of the consensus on the supposed beneﬁts of
privatization and free capital ﬂows (but not free movement of
people), the internet has come to play a vital role raising alternative
perspectives. Indeed, on some crucial issues the internet is almost
the only way, for most people, to ﬁnd out what is going on in the
world: ordinary witnesses post pictures of the insurgency in Iraq or
the situation of the poor inhabitants left to cope for themselves after
the hurricane devastated New Orleans; alternative media outﬁts
circulate their ﬁndings; and campaign groups elicit support and
mobilise supporters through the web. This is not to say that
national states do not have their ways of policing what appears on

Photography

the internet – they do, but it has made it much more difﬁcult to
maintain the virtual monopoly of information they have previously
enjoyed, and opponents of the ofﬁcial vision are becoming
increasingly savvy in using this alternative network of distribution.
In this sense, digital photography probably provides the best
opportunity for the circulation of serious photographic work since
the demise of the picture magazines.
In conclusion, it is worth, brieﬂy, considering two frequently
discussed questions in relation to digital imaging. Firstly, to what
extent are digital images photographs? Secondly, what are the
implications of this technology for photographic evidence, or
‘truth’? No less than chemical photography, digital photographs are
predicated on an indexical relation of image and referent in so far as
light entering a camera is electronically processed to generate a
code. But, as pixels are progressively transformed, this relation is
weakened. It is difﬁcult to avoid getting caught up in scholastic
disputes here: for instance, if an image of a motorcar is changed on
a computer into a picture of a bicycle, at what point does it cease to
be a photograph? Any point at which we demarcate this shift from
quantity to quality is inevitably arbitrary.
For what it is worth, I think that it is possible to point to two
features that characterize photographs – sometimes they overlap,
but not in every instance. Firstly, photographs result from the trace
left by light (or other forms of radiation) on a receptive substance.
Photographs are a kind of sculpting with light. Even manipulated
images – montaged, or reworked in other ways – are still based on
traces of some pro-ﬁlmic event. In this sense, computer-generated
images may, to a greater or lesser extent, look like photographs, but
they depart from them in signiﬁcant ways. Secondly, and perhaps
more importantly, photographs are rooted in a particular
architecture involving a lens and a dark box. It is possible, with a
computer, to produce images that do not adhere to the spatial
characteristics of this kind of image, but, in the process, they seem
to me to depart from a fundamental property of photography. In so
136

far as digital images reproduce the characteristic features of an
image made with a lens and a ﬁlm plane (and most do), they remain
photographic.

Seventy-ﬁve years ago, the German Marxist Bertolt Brecht wrote
that a documentary image of a munitions factory didn’t reveal
much about the actual conditions of production inside its walls. We
would learn more, Brecht thought, from ‘something artiﬁcial,
invented’, or ‘constructed’. Brecht’s incredibly perceptive point
suggests that mere ﬁdelity to appearance does not necessarily help
in understanding complex modern reality; in fact, a montage
construction may show us more than a picture of this kind. The
question of knowledge – of what we can learn from photographs –
doesn’t turn on the kind of objective conception often advanced; it
137

Afterword: Digital photography

As I suggested, some have seen the advent of digital photography as
representing a crisis in photography’s ability to truthfully represent
reality; in turn, this has been taken as a symptom for a wider crisis
in social knowledge. As a way of allaying this worry about altered
photographs, some commentators have suggested that newspapers
ought to identify images that have been ‘manipulated’; alternatively
that a ‘kite mark’ might be used to afﬁrm an image had not been
digitally enhanced. Both suggestions seem a little fanciful (though
the potential threat posed by digital transformation to the state’s
use of photographic evidence may necessitate some such system);
besides which, arguments of this type tend to present the chemical
photograph as inherently objective. As I argued in Chapter 5,
photographic ‘evidence’ is far from being a straightforward matter;
the question of ‘truth’ or ‘reality’ in photographs is even more
problematic. Part of the problem with this view is that it conﬂates
knowledge with the documentary mode. The documentary
tradition has real strengths (I previously characterized these as an
anti-subjective turn outwards towards the world), and the
photographic trace may register evidence in particular instances,
but neither should be taken as inherently truthful or as the solely
realistic form of photography.

Photography

rather hinges on the information revealed. Digitally manipulated
images can be used to mislead (as can chemical images), but this
kind of intervention can just as easily allow us to see and
understand more.
As the philosopher of science Ian Hacking has observed when
looking through a scanning microscope, ‘digitalization is
marvellous for censoring noise [interference] and even
reconstituting lost information’. He suggests that ‘in the study of
crystal structure, one good way to get rid of noise is to cut up a
micrograph in a systematic way, paste it back together, and
rephotograph it for interference contrast. Thus we do not in general
see through a microscope; we see with one.’ Hacking’s point is that
digital enhancement or manipulation does not necessarily entail a
nightmarish loss of reality – it can help us to perceive things more
clearly. The photograph is an aid to vision and what matters is what
it can be used to see, not its supposed status as a literal copy, and
certainly not its adherence to one particular visual tradition. The
fundamental question at stake in these debates is not simply lodged
in a technology; it is fundamentally an issue of social relations and
of the ways in which the apparatus is actually employed. Perhaps,
stripped of this simple version of realism, photography might
emerge with a stronger, more sustainable conception of
representation and evidence.
What is almost certain is that chemical photography will
increasingly be restricted to a handful of craft practitioners, rather
like etching or gum brichromate have been. An era has come to an
end, and we are now quite probably on the verge of something new.
It doesn’t really matter if this is photography or not. However, the
new may turn out to bear more than a close relation to what has
gone on before. Much of what people actually do at the moment
with digital technology is rather banal – they make the sky bluer,
remove an obtrusive thumb, restore an old family picture, or add
butterﬂy wings to a bride. Artists and experimentalists tend to make
wonky pictures or fabricate wacky creatures like nothing on earth.
138

Usually this isn’t very compelling. The more interesting usages of
the medium so far have built on photographic space and used the
technology to produce a heightened, disturbing realism.
