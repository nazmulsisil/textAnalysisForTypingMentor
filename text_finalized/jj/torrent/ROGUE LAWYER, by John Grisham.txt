PART	ONE

CONTEMPT

1.
My	name	is	Sebastian	Rudd,	and	though	I	am	a	well-known	street	lawyer,	you
will	not	see	my	name	on	billboards,	on	bus	benches,	or	screaming	at	you	from	the
yellow	 pages.	 I	 don’t	 pay	 to	 be	 seen	 on	 television,	 though	 I	 am	 often	 there.	 My
name	is	not	listed	in	any	phone	book.	I	do	not	maintain	a	traditional	office.	I	carry
a	gun,	legally,	because	my	name	and	face	tend	to	attract	attention	from	the	type	of
people	who	also	carry	guns	and	don’t	mind	using	them.	I	live	alone,	usually	sleep
alone,	and	do	not	possess	the	patience	and	understanding	necessary	to	maintain
friendships.	 The	 law	 is	 my	 life,	 always	 consuming	 and	 occasionally	 fulfilling.	 I
wouldn’t	 call	 it	 a	 “jealous	 mistress”	 as	 some	 forgotten	 person	 once	 so	 famously
did.	It’s	more	like	an	overbearing	wife	who	controls	the	checkbook.	There’s	no	way
out.
These	 nights	 I	 find	 myself	 sleeping	 in	 cheap	 motel	 rooms	 that	 change	 each
week.	I’m	not	trying	to	save	money;	rather,	I’m	just	trying	to	stay	alive.	There	are
plenty	of	people	who’d	like	to	kill	me	right	now,	and	a	few	of	them	have	been	quite
vocal.	 They	 don’t	 tell	 you	 in	 law	 school	 that	 one	 day	 you	 may	 find	 yourself
defending	 a	 person	 charged	 with	 a	 crime	 so	 heinous	 that	 otherwise	 peaceful
citizens	 feel	 driven	 to	 take	 up	 arms	 and	 threaten	 to	 kill	 the	 accused,	 his	 lawyer,
and	even	the	judge.
But	 I’ve	 been	 threatened	 before.	 It’s	 part	 of	 being	 a	 rogue	 lawyer,	 a
subspecialty	 of	 the	 profession	 that	 I	 more	 or	 less	 fell	 into	 ten	 years	 ago.	 When	 I
finished	law	school,	jobs	were	scarce.	I	reluctantly	took	a	part-time	position	in	the
City’s	 public	 defender’s	 office.	 From	 there	 I	 landed	 in	 a	 small,	 unprofitable	 firm
that	handled	only	criminal	defense.	After	a	few	years,	that	firm	blew	up	and	I	was
on	my	own,	out	on	the	street	with	plenty	of	others,	scrambling	to	make	a	buck.
One	 case	 put	 me	 on	 the	 map.	 I	 can’t	 say	 it	 made	 me	 famous	 because,
seriously,	how	can	you	say	a	lawyer	is	famous	in	a	city	of	a	million	people?	Plenty
of	 local	 hacks	 think	 they’re	 famous.	 They	 smile	 from	 billboards	 as	 they	 beg	 for
your	 bankruptcy	 and	 swagger	 in	 television	 ads	 as	 they	 seem	 deeply	 concerned
about	your	personal	injuries,	but	they’re	forced	to	pay	for	their	own	publicity.	Not
me.
The	cheap	motels	change	each	week.	I’m	in	the	middle	of	a	trial	in	a	dismal,
backwater,	redneck	town	called	Milo,	two	hours	from	where	I	live	in	the	City.	I	am
defending	a	brain-damaged	eighteen-year-old	dropout	who’s	charged	with	killing
two	little	girls	in	one	of	the	most	evil	crimes	I’ve	ever	seen,	and	I’ve	seen	plenty.
My	 clients	 are	 almost	 always	 guilty,	 so	 I	 don’t	 waste	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 wringing	 my
hands	about	whether	they	get	what	they	deserve.	In	this	case,	though,	Gardy	is	not
guilty,	not	that	it	matters.	It	does	not.	What’s	important	in	Milo	these	days	is	that
Gardy	gets	convicted	and	sentenced	to	death	and	executed	as	soon	as	possible	so
that	the	town	can	feel	better	about	itself	and	move	on.	Move	on	to	where,	exactly?

Hell	if	I	know,	nor	do	I	care.	This	place	has	been	moving	backward	for	fifty	years,
and	 one	 lousy	 verdict	 will	 not	 change	 its	 course.	 I’ve	 read	 and	 heard	 it	 said	 that
Milo	 needs	 “closure,”	 whatever	 that	 means.	 You’d	 have	 to	 be	 an	 idiot	 to	 believe
this	 town	 will	 somehow	 grow	 and	 prosper	 and	 become	 more	 tolerant	 as	 soon	 as
Gardy	gets	the	needle.
My	job	is	layered	and	complicated,	and	at	the	same	time	it’s	quite	simple.	I’m
being	paid	by	the	State	to	provide	a	first-class	defense	to	a	defendant	charged	with
capital	 murder,	 and	 this	 requires	 me	 to	 fight	 and	 claw	 and	 raise	 hell	 in	 a
courtroom	where	no	one	is	listening.	Gardy	was	essentially	convicted	the	day	he
was	 arrested,	 and	 his	 trial	 is	 only	 a	 formality.	 The	 dumb	 and	 desperate	 cops
trumped	 up	 the	 charges	 and	 fabricated	 the	 evidence.	 The	 prosecutor	 knows	 this
but	has	no	spine	and	is	up	for	reelection	next	year.	The	judge	is	asleep.	The	jurors
are	basically	nice,	simple	people,	wide-eyed	at	the	process	and	ever	so	anxious	to
believe	the	lies	their	proud	authorities	are	producing	on	the	witness	stand.
Milo	has	its	share	of	cheap	motels	but	I	can’t	stay	there.	I	would	be	lynched	or
flayed	 or	 burned	 at	 the	 stake,	 or	 if	 I’m	 lucky	 a	 sniper	 would	 hit	 me	 between	 the
eyes	 and	 it	 would	 be	 over	 in	 a	 flash.	 The	 state	 police	 are	 providing	 protection
during	the	trial,	but	I	get	the	clear	impression	these	guys	are	just	not	into	it.	They
view	 me	 the	 same	 way	 most	 people	 do.	 I’m	 a	 long-haired	 roguish	 zealot	 sick
enough	to	fight	for	the	rights	of	child	killers	and	the	like.
My	current	motel	is	a	Hampton	Inn	located	twenty-five	minutes	from	Milo.	It
costs	$60	a	night	and	the	State	will	reimburse	me.	Next	door	is	Partner,	a	hulking,
heavily	armed	guy	who	wears	black	suits	and	takes	me	everywhere.	Partner	is	my
driver,	 bodyguard,	 confidant,	 paralegal,	 caddie,	 and	 only	 friend.	 I	 earned	 his
loyalty	when	a	jury	found	him	not	guilty	of	killing	an	undercover	narcotics	officer.
We	walked	out	of	the	courtroom	arm	in	arm	and	have	been	inseparable	ever	since.
On	 at	 least	 two	 occasions,	 off-duty	 cops	 have	 tried	 to	 kill	 him.	 On	 one	 occasion,
they	came	after	me.
We’re	still	standing.	Or	perhaps	I	should	say	we’re	still	ducking.

2.
At	 8:00	 a.m.	 Partner	 knocks	 on	 my	 door.	 It’s	 time	 to	 go.	 We	 say	 our	 good
mornings	and	climb	into	my	vehicle,	which	is	a	large	black	Ford	cargo	van,	heavily
customized	 for	 my	 needs.	 Since	 it	 doubles	 as	 an	 office,	 the	 rear	 seats	 have	 been
rearranged	around	a	small	table	that	folds	into	a	wall.	There	is	a	sofa	where	I	often
spend	the	night.	All	windows	are	shaded	and	bulletproof.	It	has	a	television,	stereo
system,	Internet,	refrigerator,	bar,	a	couple	of	guns,	and	a	change	of	clothes.	I	sit
in	the	front	with	Partner	and	we	unwrap	fast-food	sausage	biscuits	as	we	leave	the
parking	 lot.	 An	 unmarked	 state	 police	 car	 moves	 in	 front	 of	 us	 for	 the	 escort	 to
Milo.	There	is	another	one	behind	us.	The	last	death	threat	was	two	days	ago	and
came	by	e-mail.
Partner	does	not	speak	unless	spoken	to.	I	didn’t	make	this	rule	but	I	adore	it.
He	is	not	the	least	bit	bothered	by	long	gaps	in	the	conversation,	nor	am	I.	After
years	 of	 saying	 next	 to	 nothing,	 we	 have	 learned	 to	 communicate	 with	 nods	 and
winks	and	silence.	Halfway	to	Milo	I	open	a	file	and	start	taking	notes.
The	 double	 murder	 was	 so	 gruesome	 no	 local	 lawyer	 would	 touch	 it.	 Then
Gardy	 was	 arrested,	 and	 one	 look	 at	 Gardy	 and	 you	 know	 he’s	 guilty.	 Long	 hair
dyed	 jet-black,	 an	 astonishing	 collection	 of	 piercings	 above	 the	 neck	 and	 tattoos
below,	matching	steel	earrings,	cold	pale	eyes,	and	a	smirk	that	says,	“Okay,	I	did
it,	 now	 what?”	 In	 its	 very	 first	 story,	 the	 Milo	 newspaper	 described	 him	 as	 “a
member	of	a	satanic	cult	who	has	a	record	of	molesting	children.”
How’s	that	for	honest	and	unbiased	reporting?	He	was	never	a	member	of	a
satanic	 cult	 and	 the	 child	 molestation	 thing	 is	 not	 what	 it	 seems.	 But	 from	 that
moment	Gardy	was	guilty,	and	I	still	marvel	at	the	fact	that	we’ve	made	it	this	far.
They	wanted	to	string	him	up	months	ago.
Needless	 to	 say,	 every	 lawyer	 in	 Milo	 locked	 his	 door	 and	 unplugged	 her
phone.	 There	 is	 no	 public	 defender	 system	 in	 the	 town—it’s	 too	 small—and	 the
indigent	 cases	 are	 doled	 out	 by	 the	 judge.	 There	 is	 an	 unwritten	 rule	 that	 the
younger	lawyers	in	town	take	these	low-paying	cases	because	(1)	someone	has	to
and	(2)	the	older	lawyers	did	so	when	they	were	younger.	But	no	one	would	agree
to	defend	Gardy,	and,	to	be	honest,	I	can’t	really	blame	them.	It’s	their	town	and
their	 lives,	 and	 to	 rub	 shoulders	 with	 such	 a	 twisted	 murderer	 could	 do	 real
damage	to	a	career.
As	 a	 society,	 we	 adhere	 to	 the	 belief	 in	 a	 fair	 trial	 for	 a	 person	 accused	 of	 a
serious	crime,	but	some	of	us	struggle	when	it	comes	to	the	business	of	providing	a
competent	 lawyer	 to	 guarantee	 said	 fair	 trial.	 Lawyers	 like	 me	 live	 with	 the
question	“But	how	do	you	represent	such	scum?”
I	offer	a	quick	“Someone	has	to”	as	I	walk	away.

Do	 we	 really	 want	 fair	 trials?	 No,	 we	 do	 not.	 We	 want	 justice,	 and	 quickly.
And	justice	is	whatever	we	deem	it	to	be	on	a	case-by-case	basis.
It’s	 just	 as	 well	 that	 we	 don’t	 believe	 in	 fair	 trials	 because	 we	 damned	 sure
don’t	have	them.	The	presumption	of	innocence	is	now	the	presumption	of	guilt.
The	 burden	 of	 proof	 is	 a	 travesty	 because	 the	 proof	 is	 often	 lies.	 Guilt	 beyond	 a
reasonable	doubt	means	if	he	probably	did	it,	then	let’s	get	him	off	the	streets.
At	 any	 rate,	 the	 lawyers	 ran	 for	 the	 hills	 and	 Gardy	 had	 no	 one.	 It’s	 a
commentary,	sad	or	otherwise,	on	my	reputation	that	I	soon	got	the	phone	call.	In
this	 end	 of	 the	 state,	 it	 is	 now	 well	 known	 in	 legal	 circles	 that	 if	 you	 can’t	 find
anybody	else,	call	Sebastian	Rudd.	He’ll	defend	anybody!
When	Gardy	was	arrested,	a	mob	showed	up	outside	the	jail	and	screamed	for
justice.	When	the	police	perp-walked	him	to	a	van	for	the	ride	to	the	courthouse,
the	mob	cursed	him	and	threw	tomatoes	and	rocks.	This	was	thoroughly	reported
by	 the	 local	 newspaper	 and	 even	 made	 the	 City’s	 evening	 news	 (there	 is	 no
network	station	based	in	Milo,	only	a	low-end	cable	outfit).	I	howled	for	a	change
of	venue,	pleaded	with	the	judge	to	move	the	trial	at	least	a	hundred	miles	away	so
we	could	hopefully	find	some	jurors	who	hadn’t	thrown	stuff	at	the	kid,	or	at	the
least	cursed	him	over	dinner.	But	we	were	denied.	All	of	my	pretrial	motions	were
denied.
Again,	the	town	wants	justice.	The	town	wants	closure.
There	 is	 no	 mob	 to	 greet	 me	 and	 my	 van	 as	 we	 pull	 in	 to	 a	 short	 driveway
behind	the	courthouse,	but	some	of	the	usual	actors	are	here.	They	huddle	behind
a	police	barricade	not	far	away	and	hold	their	sad	signs	that	say	such	clever	things
as	“Hang	the	Baby	Killer,”	and	“Satan	Is	Waiting,”	and	“Crud	Rudd	out	of	Milo!”
There	 are	 about	 a	 dozen	 of	 these	 pathetic	 souls,	 just	 waiting	 to	 jeer	 at	 me	 and,
more	important,	to	show	their	hatred	to	Gardy,	who	will	arrive	at	the	same	place
in	about	five	minutes.	During	the	early	days	of	the	trial,	this	little	crowd	attracted
cameras	and	a	few	of	these	people	made	it	into	the	newspapers,	along	with	their
signs.	 This,	 of	 course,	 encouraged	 them	 and	 they’ve	 been	 here	 every	 morning
since.	Fat	Susie	holds	the	“Crud	Rudd”	sign	and	looks	like	she	wants	to	shoot	me.
Bullet	Bob	claims	to	be	a	relative	of	one	of	the	dead	girls	and	was	quoted	as	saying
something	to	the	effect	that	a	trial	was	a	waste	of	time.
He	was	right	about	that,	I’m	afraid.
When	 the	 van	 stops,	 Partner	 hurries	 around	 to	 my	 door,	 where	 he’s	 met	 by
three	young	deputies	about	his	size.	I	step	out	and	am	properly	shielded,	then	I’m
whisked	 into	 the	 rear	 door	 of	 the	 courthouse	 as	 Bullet	 Bob	 calls	 me	 a	 whore.
Another	safe	entry.	I’m	not	aware	of	any	case	in	modern	times	in	which	a	criminal
defense	attorney	was	gunned	down	while	entering	a	courthouse	in	the	middle	of	a
trial.	Nevertheless,	I	have	resigned	myself	to	the	likelihood	that	I	could	well	be	the
first.
We	climb	a	narrow	rear	staircase	that’s	off-limits	to	everyone	else,	and	I’m	led

to	 a	 small	 windowless	 room	 where	 they	 once	 held	 prisoners	 waiting	 to	 see	 the
judge.	A	few	minutes	later,	Gardy	arrives	in	one	piece.	Partner	steps	outside	and
closes	the	door.
“How	ya	doing?”	I	ask	when	we	are	alone.
He	 smiles	 and	 rubs	 his	 wrists,	 unshackled	 for	 a	 few	 hours.	 “Okay,	 I	 guess.
Didn’t	 sleep	 much.”	 He	 didn’t	 shower	 either	 because	 he’s	 afraid	 to	 shower.	 He
tries	it	occasionally	but	they	won’t	turn	on	the	hot	water.	So	Gardy	reeks	of	stale
sweat	and	dirty	sheets,	and	I’m	thankful	he’s	far	enough	away	from	the	jury.	The
black	dye	is	slowly	leaving	his	hair	and	each	day	it	gets	lighter,	and	his	skin	gets
paler.	 He’s	 changing	 colors	 in	 front	 of	 the	 jury,	 another	 clear	 sign	 of	 his
animalistic	capabilities	and	satanic	bent.
“What’s	gonna	happen	today?”	he	asks,	with	an	almost	childlike	curiosity.	He
has	an	IQ	of	70,	just	barely	enough	to	be	prosecuted	and	put	to	death.
“More	of	the	same,	Gardy,	I’m	afraid.	Just	more	of	the	same.”
“Can’t	you	make	them	stop	lying?”
“No,	I	cannot.”
The	 State	 has	 no	 physical	 evidence	 linking	 Gardy	 to	 the	 murders.	 Zero.	 So,
instead	 of	 evaluating	 its	 lack	 of	 evidence	 and	 reconsidering	 its	 case,	 the	 State	 is
doing	what	it	often	does.	It’s	plowing	ahead	with	lies	and	fabricated	testimony.
Gardy	has	spent	two	weeks	in	the	courtroom,	listening	to	the	lies,	closing	his
eyes	while	slowly	shaking	his	head.	He’s	able	to	shake	his	head	for	hours	at	a	time,
and	the	jurors	must	think	he’s	crazy.	I’ve	told	him	to	stop,	to	sit	up,	to	take	a	pen
and	scribble	something	on	a	legal	pad	as	if	he	has	a	brain	and	wants	to	fight	back,
to	 win.	 But	 he	 simply	 cannot	 do	 this	 and	 I	 cannot	 argue	 with	 my	 client	 in	 the
courtroom.	I’ve	also	told	him	to	cover	his	arms	and	neck	to	hide	the	tattoos,	but
he’s	proud	of	them.	I’ve	told	him	to	lose	the	piercings,	but	he	insists	on	being	who
he	is.	The	bright	folks	who	run	the	Milo	jail	forbid	piercings	of	all	types,	unless,	of
course,	you’re	Gardy	and	you’re	headed	back	to	the	courtroom.	In	that	case,	stick
’em	all	over	your	face.	Look	as	sick	and	creepy	and	satanic	as	possible,	Gardy,	so
that	your	peers	will	have	no	trouble	with	your	guilt.
On	 a	 nail	 is	 a	 hanger	 with	 the	 same	 white	 shirt	 and	 khaki	 pants	 he’s	 worn
every	 day.	 I	 paid	 for	 this	 cheap	 ensemble.	 He	 slowly	 unzips	 the	 orange	 jail
jumpsuit	and	steps	out	of	it.	He	does	not	wear	underwear,	something	I	noticed	the
first	 day	 of	 the	 trial	 and	 have	 tried	 to	 ignore	 since.	 He	 slowly	 gets	 dressed.	 “So
much	lying,”	he	says.
And	he’s	right.	The	State	has	called	nineteen	witnesses	so	far	and	not	a	single
one	resisted	the	temptation	to	embellish	a	bit,	or	to	lie	outright.	The	pathologist
who	did	the	autopsies	at	the	state	crime	lab	told	the	jury	the	two	little	victims	had
drowned,	 but	 he	 also	 added	 that	 “blunt	 force	 trauma”	 to	 their	 heads	 was	 a
contributing	 factor.	 It’s	 a	 better	 story	 for	 the	 prosecution	 if	 the	 jury	 believes	 the

girls	were	raped	and	beaten	senseless	before	being	tossed	into	the	pond.	There’s
no	physical	proof	they	were	in	any	way	sexually	molested,	but	that	hasn’t	stopped
the	prosecution	from	making	this	a	part	of	its	case.	I	haggled	with	the	pathologist
for	three	hours,	but	it’s	tough	arguing	with	an	expert,	even	an	incompetent	one.
Since	the	State	has	no	evidence,	it	is	forced	to	manufacture	some.	The	most
outrageous	testimony	came	from	a	jailhouse	snitch	they	call	Smut,	an	appropriate
nickname.	Smut	is	an	accomplished	courtroom	liar	who	testifies	all	the	time	and
will	say	whatever	the	prosecutors	want	him	to	say.	In	Gardy’s	case,	Smut	was	back
in	jail	on	a	drug	charge	and	looking	at	ten	years	in	prison.	The	cops	needed	some
testimony,	and,	not	surprisingly,	Smut	was	at	their	disposal.	They	fed	him	details
of	 the	 crimes,	 then	 transferred	 Gardy	 from	 a	 regional	 jail	 to	 a	 county	 jail	 where
Smut	was	locked	up.	Gardy	had	no	idea	why	he	was	being	transferred	and	had	no
clue	that	he	was	walking	into	a	trap.	(This	happened	before	I	got	involved.)	They
threw	Gardy	into	a	small	cell	with	Smut,	who	was	anxious	to	talk	and	wanted	to
help	in	any	way.	He	claimed	to	hate	the	cops	and	know	some	good	lawyers.	He’d
also	read	about	the	murders	of	the	two	girls	and	had	a	hunch	he	knew	who	really
killed	them.	Since	Gardy	knew	nothing	about	the	murders,	he	had	nothing	to	add
to	 the	 conversation.	 Nonetheless,	 within	 twenty-four	 hours	 Smut	 claimed	 he’d
heard	a	full	confession.	The	cops	yanked	him	out	of	the	cell	and	Gardy	never	saw
him	 again,	 until	 trial.	 As	 a	 witness,	 Smut	 cleaned	 up	 nicely,	 wore	 a	 shirt	 and	 tie
and	 short	 hair,	 and	 hid	 his	 tattoos	 from	 the	 jury.	 In	 amazing	 detail,	 he	 replayed
Gardy’s	account	of	how	he	stalked	the	two	girls	into	the	woods,	knocked	them	off
their	 bikes,	 gagged	 and	 bound	 them,	 then	 tortured,	 molested,	 and	 beat	 them
before	 tossing	 them	 into	 the	 pond.	 In	 Smut’s	 version,	 Gardy	 was	 high	 on	 drugs
and	had	been	listening	to	heavy	metal.
It	 was	 quite	 a	 performance.	 I	 knew	 it	 was	 all	 a	 lie,	 as	 did	 Gardy	 and	 Smut,
along	with	the	cops	and	prosecutors,	and	I	suspect	the	judge	had	his	doubts	too.
Nevertheless,	 the	 jurors	 swallowed	 it	 in	 disgust	 and	 glared	 with	 hatred	 at	 my
client,	 who	 absorbed	 it	 with	 his	 eyes	 closed	 and	 his	 head	 shaking,	 no,	 no,	 no.
Smut’s	testimony	was	so	breathtakingly	gruesome	and	rich	with	details	that	it	was
hard	to	believe,	at	times,	that	he	was	really	fabricating	it.	No	one	can	lie	like	that!
I	hammered	at	Smut	for	eight	full	hours,	one	long	exhausting	day.	The	judge
was	 cranky	 and	 the	 jurors	 were	 bleary-eyed,	 but	 I	 could	 have	 kept	 going	 for	 a
week.	 I	 asked	 Smut	 how	 many	 times	 he’d	 testified	 in	 criminal	 trials.	 He	 said
maybe	 twice.	 I	 pulled	 out	 the	 records,	 refreshed	 his	 memory,	 and	 went	 through
the	nine	other	trials	in	which	he’d	performed	the	same	miracle	for	our	honest	and
fair-minded	prosecutors.	With	his	muddled	memory	somewhat	restored,	I	asked
him	how	many	times	he’d	had	his	sentence	reduced	by	the	prosecutors	after	lying
for	them	in	court.	He	said	never,	so	I	went	through	each	of	the	nine	cases	again.	I
produced	 the	 paperwork.	 I	 made	 it	 perfectly	 clear	 to	 everyone,	 especially	 the
jurors,	 that	 Smut	 was	 a	 lying,	 serial	 snitch	 who	 swapped	 bogus	 testimony	 for
leniency.

I	confess—I	get	angry	in	court,	and	this	is	often	detrimental.	I	blew	my	cool
with	 Smut	 and	 hammered	 him	 so	 relentlessly	 that	 some	 of	 the	 jurors	 became
sympathetic.	 The	 judge	 finally	 told	 me	 to	 move	 on,	 but	 I	 didn’t.	 I	 hate	 liars,
especially	those	who	swear	to	tell	the	truth	and	then	fabricate	testimony	to	convict
my	client.	I	yelled	at	Smut	and	the	judge	yelled	at	me,	and	at	times	it	seemed	as
though	everyone	was	yelling.	This	did	not	help	Gardy’s	cause.
You	 would	 think	 the	 prosecutor	 might	 break	 up	 his	 parade	 of	 liars	 with	 a
credible	 witness,	 but	 this	 would	 require	 some	 intelligence.	 His	 next	 witness	 was
another	inmate,	another	druggie	who	testified	he	was	in	the	hallway	near	Gardy’s
cell	and	heard	him	confess	to	Smut.
Lies	on	top	of	lies.
“Please	make	them	stop,”	Gardy	says.
“I’m	trying,	Gardy.	I’m	doing	the	best	I	can.	We	need	to	go.”

3.
A	deputy	leads	us	into	the	courtroom,	which	is	again	packed	with	people	and
heavy	with	a	layer	of	tense	apprehension.	This	is	the	tenth	day	of	testimony,	and	I
now	believe	there	is	absolutely	nothing	else	happening	in	this	backwater	town.	We
are	 the	 entertainment!	 The	 courtroom	 is	 packed	 from	 gavel	 to	 gavel	 and	 they’re
lined	 up	 against	 the	 walls.	 Thank	 God	 the	 weather	 is	 cool	 or	 we’d	 all	 be	 soaked
with	sweat.
Every	capital	murder	trial	requires	the	presence	of	at	least	two	lawyers	for	the
defense.	My	co-counsel,	or	“second	chair,”	is	Trots,	a	thick,	dull	boy	who	ought	to
burn	 his	 law	 license	 and	 curse	 the	 day	 he	 ever	 dreamed	 of	 showing	 his	 face	 in	 a
courtroom.	He’s	from	a	small	town	twenty	miles	away,	far	enough,	he	thought,	to
shield	 him	 from	 the	 unpleasantness	 of	 getting	 caught	 up	 in	 Gardy’s	 nightmare.
Trots	volunteered	to	handle	the	preliminary	matters,	intending	to	jump	ship	if	a
trial	became	a	reality.	His	plans	have	not	worked	out	to	suit	him.	He	screwed	up
the	preliminaries	as	only	a	rookie	can,	then	tried	to	extricate	himself.	No	go,	said
the	 judge.	 Trots	 then	 thought	 it	 might	 be	 an	 acceptable	 idea	 to	 sit	 in	 the	 second
chair,	gain	some	experience,	feel	the	pressure	of	a	real	trial,	and	so	on,	but	after
several	 death	 threats	 he	 stopped	 trying.	 Death	 threats	 are	 just	 part	 of	 the	 daily
grind	for	me,	like	the	morning	coffee	and	lying	cops.
I’ve	filed	three	motions	to	remove	Trots	from	the	second	chair.	All	denied,	of
course,	 so	 Gardy	 and	 I	 are	 stuck	 with	 a	 moron	 at	 our	 table	 who’s	 more	 of	 a
hindrance	 than	 an	 assistant.	 Trots	 sits	 as	 far	 away	 as	 possible,	 though	 given
Gardy’s	current	state	of	hygiene	I	can’t	really	blame	him.
Gardy	told	me	months	ago	that	when	he	was	first	interviewed	by	Trots	at	the
county	 jail	 the	 lawyer	 was	 shocked	 when	 Gardy	 claimed	 he	 was	 innocent.	 They
even	argued	about	it.	How’s	that	for	a	vigorous	defender?
So	Trots	sits	at	the	end	of	the	table,	his	head	buried	in	useless	note	taking,	his
eyes	 seeing	 nothing,	 his	 ears	 hearing	 nothing,	 but	 he	 feels	 the	 stares	 of	 all	 those
sitting	 behind	 us	 who	 hate	 us	 and	 want	 to	 string	 us	 up	 with	 our	 client.	 Trots
figures	this	too	shall	pass	and	he’ll	get	on	with	his	life	and	career	the	moment	the
trial	is	over.	He	is	wrong.	As	soon	as	possible,	I’ll	file	an	ethics	complaint	with	the
state	 bar	 association	 alleging	 Trots	 provided	 “ineffective	 assistance	 of	 counsel”
before	and	during	the	trial.	I’ve	done	this	before	and	I	know	how	to	make	it	stick.
I’m	 fighting	 my	 own	 battles	 with	 the	 bar	 and	 I	 understand	 the	 game.	 After	 I	 get
finished	with	Trots,	he’ll	want	to	surrender	his	license	and	get	a	job	at	a	used-car
lot.
Gardy	 takes	 his	 seat	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 our	 table.	 Trots	 does	 not	 look	 at	 his
client,	nor	does	he	speak.
Huver,	the	prosecutor,	walks	over	and	hands	me	a	sheet	of	paper.	There	are

no	 good	 mornings	 or	 hellos.	 We	 are	 so	 far	 beyond	 even	 the	 most	 benign
pleasantries	that	a	civilized	grunt	from	either	of	us	would	be	a	surprise.	I	loathe
this	 man	 the	 way	 he	 loathes	 me,	 but	 I	 have	 an	 advantage	 in	 the	 hating	 game.
Almost	 monthly	 I	 deal	 with	 self-righteous	 prosecutors	 who	 lie,	 cheat,	 stonewall,
cover	 up,	 ignore	 ethics,	 and	 do	 whatever	 it	 takes	 to	 get	 a	 conviction,	 even	 when
they	know	the	truth	and	the	truth	tells	them	they	are	wrong.	So	I	know	the	breed,
the	ilk,	the	subclass	of	lawyer	who’s	above	the	law	because	he	is	the	law.	Huver,	on
the	other	hand,	rarely	deals	with	a	rogue	like	me	because,	sadly	for	him,	he	doesn’t
see	many	sensational	cases,	and	almost	none	in	which	a	defendant	shows	up	with
a	pit	bull	for	a	protector.	If	he	dealt	with	rabid	defense	lawyers	more	regularly,	he
might	be	more	adept	at	hating	us.	For	me,	it’s	a	way	of	life.
I	take	the	sheet	of	paper	and	say,	“So	who’s	your	liar	of	the	day?”
He	says	nothing	and	walks	a	few	feet	back	to	his	table,	where	his	little	gang	of
assistants	 huddle	 importantly	 in	 their	 dark	 suits	 and	 ham	 it	 up	 for	 the	 home
crowd.	They	are	on	display	in	this,	the	biggest	show	of	their	miserable	backwater
careers,	and	I	often	get	the	impression	that	everyone	from	the	DA’s	office	who	can
walk,	talk,	wear	a	cheap	suit,	and	carry	a	new	briefcase	is	packed	around	the	table
to	insure	justice.
The	bailiff	barks,	I	stand,	Judge	Kaufman	enters,	then	we	sit.	Gardy	refuses	to
stand	 in	 homage	 to	 the	 great	 man.	 Initially,	 this	 really	 pissed	 off	 His	 Honor.	 On
the	first	day	of	trial—it	now	seems	like	months	ago—he	snapped	at	me,	“Mr.	Rudd,
would	you	please	ask	your	client	to	stand?”
I	did,	and	he	refused.	This	embarrassed	the	judge	and	we	discussed	it	later	in
his	chambers.	He	threatened	to	hold	my	client	in	contempt	and	keep	him	in	jail	all
day	 long	 during	 the	 trial.	 I	 tried	 to	 encourage	 this	 but	 let	 it	 slip	 that	 such	 an
overreaction	would	be	mentioned	repeatedly	on	appeal.
Gardy	 wisely	 observed,	 “What	 can	 they	 do	 to	 me	 that	 they	 haven’t	 already
done?”	So	each	morning	Judge	Kaufman	begins	the	ceremonies	with	a	long,	nasty
scowl	 at	 my	 client,	 who’s	 usually	 slouched	 in	 his	 chair	 either	 picking	 at	 his	 nose
ring	or	nodding	with	his	eyes	closed.	It’s	impossible	to	tell	which	one	of	us,	lawyer
or	 client,	 Kaufman	 despises	 the	 most.	 Like	 the	 rest	 of	 Milo,	 he’s	 been	 convinced
for	a	long	time	that	Gardy	is	guilty.	And,	like	everybody	else	in	the	courtroom,	he
has	loathed	me	from	day	one.
Doesn’t	 matter.	 In	 this	 line	 of	 work	 you	 rarely	 have	 allies	 and	 you	 quickly
make	enemies.
Since	 he’s	 up	 for	 reelection	 next	 year,	 as	 is	 Huver,	 Kaufman	 slaps	 on	 his
phony	 politician’s	 smile	 and	 welcomes	 everyone	 to	 his	 courtroom	 for	 another
interesting	 day	 in	 the	 pursuit	 of	 the	 truth.	 Based	 on	 the	 calculations	 I	 made	 one
day	 during	 lunch	 when	 the	 courtroom	 was	 empty,	 there	 are	 about	 310	 people
sitting	 behind	 me.	 Except	 for	 Gardy’s	 mother	 and	 sister,	 everyone	 is	 fervently
praying	 for	 a	 conviction,	 with	 a	 quick	 execution	 to	 follow.	 It’s	 up	 to	 Judge

Kaufman	to	deliver.	This	is	the	judge	who	has	so	far	allowed	every	word	of	bogus
testimony	 offered	 by	 the	 State.	 At	 times	 it	 seems	 as	 though	 he’s	 afraid	 he	 might
lose	a	vote	or	two	if	he	sustains	one	of	my	objections.
When	everyone	is	in	place,	they	bring	in	the	jury.	There	are	fourteen	people
crammed	 in	 the	 box—the	 chosen	 twelve	 plus	 a	 couple	 of	 alternates	 in	 case
someone	gets	sick	or	does	something	wrong.	They	are	not	sequestered	(though	I
requested	this),	so	they	are	free	to	go	home	at	night	and	trash	Gardy	and	me	over
dinner.	 Late	 each	 afternoon,	 they	 are	 warned	 by	 His	 Honor	 not	 to	 utter	 a	 single
word	 about	 the	 case,	 but	 you	 can	 almost	 hear	 them	 yakking	 as	 they	 drive	 away.
Their	 decision	 has	 been	 made.	 If	 they	 voted	 right	 now,	 before	 we	 offer	 a	 single
witness	 in	 defense,	 they	 would	 find	 him	 guilty	 and	 demand	 his	 execution.	 Then
they	 would	 return	 home	 as	 heroes	 and	 talk	 about	 this	 trial	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 their
lives.	When	Gardy	gets	the	needle,	they	will	take	special	pride	in	their	crucial	role
in	 finding	 justice.	 They	 will	 be	 elevated	 in	 Milo.	 They	 will	 be	 congratulated,
stopped	on	the	streets,	recognized	at	church.
Still	sappy,	Kaufman	welcomes	them	back,	thanks	them	for	their	civic	service,
asks	gravely	whether	anyone	tried	to	contact	them	in	an	effort	to	gain	influence.
This	usually	prompts	a	few	looks	in	my	direction,	as	if	I	have	the	time,	energy,	and
stupidity	to	slink	around	the	streets	of	Milo	at	night	stalking	these	same	jurors	so	I
can	 (1)	 bribe	 them,	 (2)	 intimidate	 them,	 or	 (3)	 plead	 with	 them.	 It’s	 now	 gospel
that	I’m	the	only	crook	in	the	room,	in	spite	of	the	torrent	of	sins	committed	by
the	other	side.
The	 truth	 is,	 if	 I	 had	 the	 money,	 the	 time,	 and	 the	 personnel,	 I	 would	bribe
and/or	 intimidate	 every	 juror.	 When	 the	 State,	 with	 its	 limitless	 resources,
commences	 a	 fraudulent	 case	 and	 cheats	 at	 every	 turn,	 then	 cheating	 is
legitimized.	 There	 is	 no	 level	 playing	 field.	 There	 is	 no	 fairness.	 The	 only
honorable	alternative	for	a	lawyer	fighting	to	save	an	innocent	client	is	to	cheat	in
defense.
However,	 if	 a	 defense	 lawyer	 is	 caught	 cheating,	 he	 or	 she	 gets	 nailed	 with
sanctions	 by	 the	 court,	 reprimanded	 by	 the	 state	 bar	 association,	 maybe	 even
indicted.	If	a	prosecutor	gets	caught	cheating,	he	either	gets	reelected	or	elevated
to	the	bench.	Our	system	never	holds	a	bad	prosecutor	accountable.
The	jurors	assure	His	Honor	that	all	is	well.	“Mr.	Huver,”	he	announces	with
great	 solemnity,	 “please	 call	 your	 next	 witness.”	 Next	 up	 for	 the	 State	 is	 a
fundamentalist	 preacher	 who	 converted	 the	 old	 Chrysler	 dealership	 into	 the
World	 Harvest	 Temple	 and	 is	 drawing	 crowds	 to	 his	 daily	 prayer-a-thons.	 I
watched	him	once	on	local	cable;	once	is	enough.	His	claim	to	fame	here	is	that	he
says	he	confronted	Gardy	in	the	middle	of	a	late-night	youth	service.	According	to
his	version,	Gardy	was	wearing	a	T-shirt	advertising	a	heavy	metal	rock	group	and
conveying	some	vague	satanic	message,	and	this	T-shirt	was	allowing	the	devil	to
infiltrate	the	service.	Spiritual	warfare	was	in	the	air,	and	God	was	unhappy	with
things.	With	divine	direction,	the	preacher	finally	located	the	source	of	evil	in	the

crowd,	 stopped	 the	 music,	 stormed	 back	 to	 where	 Gardy	 was	 sitting,	 and	 kicked
him	out	of	the	building.
Gardy	says	he’s	never	been	near	the	church.	Further,	Gardy	claims	he’s	never
seen	 the	 inside	 of	 any	 church	 in	 all	 of	 his	 eighteen	 years.	 His	 mother	 confirms
this.	As	they	say	out	here	in	the	country,	Gardy’s	family	is	severely	“unchurched.”
Why	 this	 is	 allowed	 as	 testimony	 in	 a	 capital	 murder	 case	 is	 thoroughly
inconceivable.	 It	 is	 ridiculous	 and	 borders	 on	 stupidity.	 Assuming	 there	 is	 a
conviction,	all	of	this	crap	will	be	reviewed	in	about	two	years	by	a	dispassionate
appellate	 court	 two	 hundred	 miles	 away.	 Those	 judges,	 only	 slightly	 more
intelligent	than	Kaufman	but	anything	is	an	improvement,	will	take	a	dim	view	of
this	 redneck	 preacher	 telling	 his	 trumped-up	 story	 about	 an	 altercation	 that
supposedly	took	place	some	thirteen	months	before	the	murders.
I	object.	Overruled.	I	object,	angrily.	I’m	overruled,	angrily.
Huver,	though,	is	desperate	to	keep	Satan	involved	in	his	theory	of	the	case.
Judge	 Kaufman	 opened	 the	 gates	 days	 ago	 and	 anything	 is	 welcome.	 However,
he’ll	slam	them	as	soon	as	I	start	calling	witnesses.	We’ll	be	lucky	to	get	a	hundred
words	into	the	record.
The	 preacher	 has	 an	 unpaid	 tax	 bill	 in	 another	 state.	 He	 doesn’t	 know	 I’ve
found	 it,	 and	 thus	 we’ll	 have	 some	 fun	 on	 cross-examination.	 Not	 that	 it	 will
matter;	it	will	not.	This	jury	is	done.	Gardy	is	a	monster	who	deserves	to	go	to	hell.
Their	job	is	to	speed	him	along.
He	leans	over	long	enough	to	whisper,	“Mr.	Rudd,	I	swear	I’ve	never	been	to
church.”
I	nod	and	smile	because	this	is	all	I	can	do.	A	defense	lawyer	cannot	always
believe	his	clients,	but	when	Gardy	says	he’s	never	been	to	church,	I	believe	him.
The	 preacher	 has	 a	 temper	 and	 I	 soon	 stoke	 it.	 I	 use	 the	 unpaid	 tax	 bill	 to
really	 irritate	 him,	 and	 once	 he’s	 pissed	 he	 stays	 that	 way.	 I	 lead	 him	 into
arguments	over	the	inerrancy	of	scripture,	the	Trinity,	the	apocalypse,	speaking	in
tongues,	 playing	 with	 snakes,	 drinking	 poison,	 and	 the	 pervasiveness	 of	 satanic
cults	in	the	Milo	area.	Huver	yells	objections	and	Kaufman	sustains	them.	At	one
point	the	preacher,	pious	and	red-faced,	closes	his	eyes	and	raises	both	hands	as
high	 as	 possible.	 Instinctively,	 I	 freeze	 and	 cower	 and	 look	 at	 the	 ceiling	 as	 if	 a
lightning	bolt	is	coming.	Later,	he	calls	me	an	atheist	and	says	I’m	going	to	hell.
“So	you	have	the	authority	to	send	folks	to	hell?”	I	fire	back.
“God	tells	me	you’re	going	to	hell.”
“Then	put	Him	on	the	loudspeaker	so	we	can	all	hear.”
Two	 jurors	 actually	 chuckle	 at	 this.	 Kaufman	 has	 had	 enough.	 He	 raps	 the
gavel	and	calls	for	lunch.	We’ve	wasted	the	morning	with	this	sanctimonious	little
prick	and	his	bogus	testimony,	but	he’s	not	the	first	local	to	wedge	himself	into	the

trial.	The	town	is	filled	with	wannabe	heroes.

4.
Lunch	is	always	a	treat.	Since	it’s	not	safe	to	leave	the	courthouse,	actually	the
courtroom	itself,	Gardy	and	I	eat	a	sandwich	by	ourselves	at	the	defense	table.	It’s
the	same	box	lunch	fed	to	the	jurors.	They	bring	in	sixteen	of	them,	mix	them	up,
draw	ours	at	random,	and	take	the	rest	to	the	jury	room.	This	was	my	idea	because
I	prefer	not	to	be	poisoned.	Gardy	has	no	clue;	he’s	just	hungry.	He	says	the	food
at	 the	 jail	 is	 what	 you’d	 expect	 and	 he	 doesn’t	 trust	 the	 guards.	 He	 eats	 nothing
there,	and	since	he’s	surviving	only	on	lunch,	I	asked	Judge	Kaufman	if	the	county
could	 perhaps	 double	 up	 and	 give	 the	 boy	 two	 rubber	 chicken	 sandwiches,	 with
extra	 chips	 and	 another	 pickle.	 In	 other	 words,	 two	 box	 lunches	 instead	 of	 one.
Denied.
So	 Gardy	 gets	 half	 of	 my	 sandwich	 and	 all	 of	 my	 kosher	 dill.	 If	 I	 weren’t
starving,	he	could	have	the	entire	box	of	crap.
Partner	 comes	 and	 goes	 throughout	 the	 day.	 He’s	 afraid	 to	 leave	 our	 van	 in
one	spot	due	to	the	high	probability	of	slashed	tires	and	cracked	windows.	He	also
has	a	few	responsibilities,	one	of	which	is	to	meet	occasionally	with	the	Bishop.
In	these	cases	where	I’m	called	into	a	combat	zone,	into	a	small	town	that	has
already	closed	ranks	and	is	ready	to	kill	one	of	its	own	for	some	heinous	crime,	it
takes	a	while	to	find	a	contact.	This	contact	is	always	another	lawyer,	a	local	who
also	 defends	 criminals	 and	 butts	 heads	 weekly	 with	 the	 police	 and	 prosecutors.
This	 contact	 reaches	 out	 eventually,	 quietly,	 afraid	 of	 being	 exposed	 as	 a	 traitor.
He	knows	the	truth,	or	something	close	to	it.	He	knows	the	players,	the	bad	actors,
and	the	occasional	good	one.	Since	his	survival	depends	on	getting	along	with	the
cops	and	court	clerks	and	assistant	prosecutors,	he	knows	the	system.
In	 Gardy’s	 case,	 my	 deep-throated	 pal	 is	 Jimmy	 Bressup.	 We	 call	 him	 the
Bishop.	I’ve	never	met	him.	He	works	through	Partner	and	they	meet	in	strange
places.	Partner	says	he’s	about	sixty	with	long,	thinning	gray	hair,	bad	clothes,	a
loud,	 foul	 mouth,	 an	 abrasive	 nature,	 and	 a	 weakness	 for	 the	 bottle.	 “An	 older
version	of	me?”	I	asked.	“Not	quite,”	came	the	wise	reply.	For	all	his	bluster	and
big	talk,	the	Bishop	is	afraid	of	getting	too	close	to	Gardy’s	lawyers.
The	Bishop	says	Huver	and	his	gang	know	by	now	they’ve	got	the	wrong	guy
but	have	too	much	invested	to	stop	and	admit	their	mistakes.	He	says	there	have
been	whispers	from	day	one	about	the	real	killer.

5.
It’s	 Friday	 and	 everyone	 in	 the	 courtroom	 is	 exhausted.	 I	 spend	 an	 hour
haranguing	 a	 pimply,	 stupid	 little	 brat	 who	 claims	 he	 was	 at	 the	 same	 church
service	when	Gardy	called	forth	the	demons	and	disrupted	things.	Honestly,	I’ve
seen	the	worst	of	bogus	courtroom	evidence,	but	I’ve	never	seen	anything	as	bad
as	 this.	 In	 addition	 to	 being	 false,	 it	 is	 wholly	 irrelevant.	 No	 other	 prosecutor
would	bother	with	it.	No	other	judge	would	admit	it.	Kaufman	finally	announces
an	adjournment	for	the	weekend.
Gardy	and	I	meet	in	the	holding	room,	where	he	changes	into	his	jail	uniform
while	I	offer	banalities	about	having	a	good	weekend.	I	give	him	ten	bucks	for	the
vending	 machines.	 He	 says	 tomorrow	 his	 mother	 will	 bring	 him	 lemon	 cookies,
his	favorite.	Sometimes	the	guards	pass	them	through;	sometimes	they	keep	them
for	their	own	nourishment.	One	never	knows.	The	guards	average	three	hundred
pounds	each,	so	I	guess	they	need	the	stolen	calories.	I	tell	Gardy	to	take	a	shower
over	the	weekend	and	wash	his	hair.
He	says,	“Mr.	Rudd,	if	I	find	a	razor,	I’m	gone.”	With	an	index	finger,	he	does
a	slashing	motion	against	his	wrist.
“Don’t	 say	 that,	 Gardy.”	 He’s	 said	 it	 before	 and	 he	 means	 it.	 The	 kid	 has
nothing	to	live	for	and	he’s	smart	enough	to	see	what’s	coming.	Hell,	a	blind	man
could	 see	 it.	 We	 shake	 hands	 and	 I	 hurry	 down	 the	 back	 steps.	 Partner	 and	 the
deputies	 meet	 me	 at	 the	 rear	 door	 and	 shove	 me	 into	 our	 vehicle.	 Another	 safe
exit.
Outside	 Milo,	 I	 begin	 to	 nod	 and	 soon	 fall	 asleep.	 Ten	 minutes	 later,	 my
phone	 vibrates	 and	 I	 answer	 it.	 We	 follow	 the	 state	 trooper	 back	 to	 our	 motel,
where	we	grab	our	luggage	and	check	out.	Soon	we	are	alone	and	headed	for	the
City.
“Did	you	see	the	Bishop?”	I	ask	Partner.
“Oh	yes.	It’s	Friday,	and	I	think	he	starts	drinking	around	noon	on	Friday.	But
beer	 only,	 he’s	 quick	 to	 point	 out.	 So	 I	 bought	 a	 six-pack	 and	 we	 drove	 around.
The	 joint	 is	 a	 real	 dive,	 out	 east,	 just	 beyond	 the	 city	 limits.	 He	 says	 Peeley	 is	 a
regular.”
“So	you’ve	had	a	few	beers	already?	Should	I	be	driving?”
“Only	one,	boss.	I	sipped	it	until	it	was	warm.	The	Bishop,	on	the	other	hand,
took	his	cold.	Three	of	them.”
“And	we	believe	this	guy?”
“I’m	just	doing	my	job.	On	the	one	hand,	he	has	credibility	because	he’s	lived
here	all	his	life	and	knows	everyone.	On	the	other,	he’s	so	full	of	crap	you	want	to

dismiss	everything	he	says.”
“We’ll	see.”	I	close	my	eyes	and	try	to	nap.	Sleep	is	virtually	impossible	in	the
midst	of	a	capital	murder	trial,	and	I’ve	learned	to	grab	it	whenever	possible.	I’ve
stolen	ten	minutes	on	a	hard	bench	in	an	empty	courtroom	during	lunch,	just	as
I’ve	paced	back	and	forth	in	a	dingy	motel	room	at	three	in	the	morning.	I	often
black	out	in	mid-sentence	when	Partner	drives	and	the	van	hums	along.
At	some	point,	as	we	head	back	to	our	version	of	civilization,	I	fade	away.

6.
It’s	the	third	Friday	of	the	month,	and	I	have	a	standing	date,	if	you’d	call	two
drinks	a	real	date.	It	feels	more	like	an	appointment	for	a	root	canal.	The	truth	is
this	woman	wouldn’t	date	me	at	gunpoint,	and	the	feelings	are	so	mutual.	But	we
have	a	history.	We	meet	at	the	same	bar,	in	the	same	booth	where	we	had	our	first
meal	 together,	 in	 another	 lifetime.	 Nostalgia	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 it;	 it’s	 all
about	 convenience.	 It’s	 a	 corporate	 bar	 downtown,	 one	 of	 a	 chain,	 but	 the
ambience	is	not	bad	and	it’s	lively	on	Friday	evenings.
Judith	 Whitly	 arrives	 first	 and	 gets	 the	 booth.	 I	 slide	 in	 a	 few	 minutes	 later
just	as	she’s	about	to	get	irritated.	She	has	never	been	late	for	anything	and	views
tardiness	as	a	sign	of	weakness.	In	her	opinion,	I	possess	many	of	these	signs.	She,
too,	is	a	lawyer—that’s	how	we	met.
“You	look	tired,”	she	says	without	a	trace	of	compassion.	She,	too,	is	showing
signs	of	fatigue,	though,	at	thirty-nine,	she	is	still	strikingly	beautiful.	Every	time	I
see	her	I’m	reminded	of	why	I	fell	so	hard.
“Thank	you,	and	you	look	great,	as	always.”
“Thanks.”
“Ten	days	and	we’re	all	running	out	of	gas.”
“Any	luck?”	she	asks.
“Not	yet.”	She	knows	the	basics	of	Gardy’s	case	and	trial	and	she	knows	me.	If
I	 believe	 the	 kid	 is	 innocent,	 that’s	 good	 enough	 for	 her.	 But	 she	 has	 her	 own
clients	 to	 fret	 and	 lose	 sleep	 over.	 We	 order	 drinks—her	 standard	 Friday	 night
glass	of	chardonnay	and	my	whiskey	sour.
We’ll	have	two	drinks	in	less	than	an	hour,	then	that’s	it	for	another	month.
“How’s	 Starcher?”	 I	 ask.	 I	 keep	 hoping	 that	 one	 day	 I	 can	 pronounce	 my	 son’s
name	 without	 hating	 it,	 but	 that	 day	 has	 not	 arrived.	 My	 name	 is	 on	 his	 birth
certificate	as	the	father,	but	I	wasn’t	around	when	he	was	born.	Therefore,	Judith
had	control	over	the	name.	It	should	be	someone’s	last	name,	if	it	has	to	be	used	at
all.
“He’s	 doing	 well,”	 she	 says	 smugly,	 because	 she’s	 thoroughly	 involved	 with
the	kid’s	life	and	I	am	not.	“I	met	with	his	teacher	last	week	and	she’s	pleased	with
his	 progress.	 She	 says	 he’s	 just	 a	 normal	 second	 grader	 who’s	 reading	 at	 a	 high
level	and	enjoying	life.”
“That’s	 good	 to	 hear,”	 I	 say.	 “Normal”	 is	 the	 key	 word	 here	 because	 of	 our
history.	Starcher	is	not	being	raised	the	normal	way.	He	spends	half	his	time	with
Judith	 and	 her	 current	 partner	 and	 the	 other	 half	 with	 her	 parents.	 From	 the
hospital,	she	took	Starcher	to	an	apartment	she	shared	with	Gwyneth,	the	woman

she	left	me	for.	They	then	spent	three	years	trying	to	legally	adopt	Starcher,	but	I
fought	them	like	a	rabid	animal.	I	have	nothing	against	gay	couples	adopting	kids.
I	just	couldn’t	stand	Gwyneth.	And	I	was	right.	They	split	not	long	afterward	in	a
nasty	fight,	one	I	enjoyed	immensely	from	deep	in	left	field.
It	gets	more	complicated.	The	drinks	arrive	and	we	don’t	bother	with	a	polite
“Cheers.”	That	would	only	waste	time.	We	need	the	alcohol	ASAP.
I	 deliver	 the	 awful	 news	 by	 saying,	 “My	 mother	 is	 coming	 to	 town	 next
weekend	and	she’d	like	to	see	Starcher.	He	is,	after	all,	her	only	grandson.”
“I	know	that,”	she	snaps.	“It’s	your	weekend.	You	can	do	what	you	want.”
“True,	 but	 you	 have	 a	 way	 of	 complicating	 everything.	 I	 just	 don’t	 want	 any
trouble,	that’s	all.”
“Your	mother	is	nothing	but	trouble.”
Truer	words	were	never	spoken,	and	I	nod	in	defeat.	It	would	be	a	dramatic
understatement	 to	 say	 that	 Judith	 and	 my	 mother	 hated	 each	 other	 from	 the
opening	 bell.	 So	 much	 so	 that	 my	 mother	 informed	 me	 she	 would	 cut	 me	 out	 of
her	last	will	and	testament	if	I	married	Judith.	At	the	time,	I	was	secretly	having
some	 serious	 doubts	 about	 our	 romance	 and	 our	 future,	 but	 that	 threat	 was	 the
last	 straw.	 Though	 I	 expect	 Mom	 to	 live	 to	 be	 a	 hundred,	 her	 estate	 will	 be	 a
delight.	A	guy	with	my	income	needs	a	dream.	A	subplot	in	this	sad	story	is	that
my	 mother	 often	 uses	 her	 will	 to	 bully	 her	 children.	 My	 sister	 married	 a
Republican	 and	 got	 herself	 cut	 out	 of	 the	 will.	 Two	 years	 later,	 the	 Republican,
who’s	 really	 a	 nice	 guy,	 became	 the	 father	 of	 the	 most	 perfect	 granddaughter	 in
history.	Now	my	sister	is	back	in	the	will,	or	so	we	think.
Anyway,	 I	 was	 preparing	 to	 break	 up	 with	 Judith	 when	 she	 gave	 me	 the
crushing	news	that	she	was	pregnant.	I	assumed	I	was	the	father,	though	I	didn’t
ask	 that	 loaded	 question.	 Later	 I	 learned	 the	 brutal	 truth	 that	 she	 was	 already
seeing	 Gwyneth.	 Talk	 about	 a	 shot	 to	 the	 gut.	 I’m	 sure	 there	 were	 clues	 that	 my
dearly	beloved	was	actually	a	lesbian,	but	I	missed	every	one	of	them.
We	got	married.	Mom	said	she	changed	her	will	and	I	would	get	not	a	penny.
We	lived	together	off	and	on	for	five	wretched	months,	were	technically	married
for	fifteen	more,	and	split	to	save	our	sanity.	Starcher	arrived	in	the	middle	of	the
war,	a	casualty	from	birth,	and	we’ve	been	sniping	at	each	other	ever	since.	This
ritual	of	meeting	once	a	month	for	drinks	is	our	homage	to	forced	civility.
I	think	I’m	back	in	my	dear	mother’s	will.
“And	what	does	Mummy	plan	to	do	with	my	child?”	she	asks.	It’s	never	“our”
child.	She	has	never	been	able	to	resist	the	little	digs,	the	sophomoric	cheap	shots.
She	 picks	 at	 the	 scabs,	 but	 not	 even	 in	 a	 clever	 way.	 It’s	 almost	 impossible	 to
ignore,	but	I’ve	learned	to	bite	my	tongue.	My	tongue	has	scars.
“I	think	they’re	going	to	the	zoo.”

“She	always	takes	him	to	the	zoo.”
“What’s	the	harm	in	going	to	the	zoo?”
“Well,	last	time	he	had	nightmares	about	pythons.”
“Okay,	I’ll	ask	her	to	take	him	somewhere	else.”	She’s	already	causing	trouble.
What	could	be	wrong	with	taking	a	fairly	normal	seven-year-old	boy	to	the	zoo?	I
don’t	know	why	we	meet	like	this.
“How	 are	 things	 around	 the	 firm?”	 I	 ask,	 my	 curiosity	 similar	 to	 that	 of
watching	a	car	wreck.	It’s	irresistible.
“Fine,”	she	says.	“The	usual	turmoil.”
“You	need	some	boys	in	that	firm.”
“We	have	enough	problems.”	The	waiter	notices	both	glasses	are	empty	and
goes	for	another	round.	The	first	drinks	always	disappear	fast.
Judith	 is	 one	 of	 four	 partners	 in	 a	 firm	 of	 ten	 women,	 all	 militant	 lesbians.
The	 firm	 specializes	 in	 gay	 law—discrimination	 in	 employment,	 housing,
education,	 health	 care,	 and	 the	 latest:	 gay	 divorce.	 They’re	 good	 lawyers,	 tough
negotiators	 and	 litigators,	 always	 on	 the	 attack	 and	 often	 in	 the	 news.	 The	 firm
projects	 an	 image	 of	 being	 at	 war	 with	 society	 and	 never	 backing	 down.	 The
outside	fights,	though,	are	far	less	colorful	than	the	inside	brawls.
“I	could	join	as	the	senior	partner,”	I	say	in	an	effort	at	levity.
“You	 wouldn’t	 last	 ten	 minutes.”	 No	 man	 would	 last	 ten	 minutes	 in	 their
offices.	In	fact,	men	avoid	them	zealously.	Mention	the	name	of	her	firm	and	men
run	for	the	hills.	Fine	fellows	caught	screwing	around	jump	off	bridges.
“You’re	probably	right.	Do	you	ever	miss	sex	with	the	opposite	sex?”
“Seriously,	Sebastian,	you	want	to	talk	about	straight	sex,	after	a	bad	marriage
and	an	unwanted	child?”
“I	like	straight	sex.	Did	you	ever	like	it?	You	seemed	to.”
“I	was	faking.”
“You	were	not.	You	were	pretty	wonderful,	as	I	recall.”	I	know	two	guys	who
slept	with	her	before	I	came	along.	Then	she	ran	to	Gwyneth.	I’ve	often	wondered
if	I	was	so	lousy	in	bed	that	I	drove	her	to	switch	teams.	I	doubt	it.	I	must	say	she
has	 a	 good	 eye.	 I	 loathed	 Gwyneth,	 still	 do,	 but	 the	 woman	 could	 stop	 traffic	 on
any	street	in	town.	And	her	current	partner,	Ava,	once	modeled	lingerie	for	a	local
department	store.	I	remember	her	ads	in	the	Sunday	newspaper.
The	second	drinks	arrive	and	we	grab	them.
“If	you	want	to	talk	about	sex,	I’m	leaving,”	she	says,	but	she’s	not	angry.
“I’m	sorry.	Look,	Judith,	every	time	I	see	you	I	think	about	sex.	My	problem,
not	yours.”

“Get	help.”
“I	don’t	need	help.	I	need	sex.”
“Are	you	propositioning	me?”
“Would	it	do	any	good?”
“No.”
“Didn’t	think	so.”
“You	have	fights	tonight?”	she	asks,	changing	the	subject,	and	I	don’t	resist.
“I	do.”
“You’re	sick,	you	know.	That’s	such	a	brutal	sport.”
“Starcher	says	he	wants	to	go.”
“You	take	Starcher	to	the	cage	fights	and	you’ll	never	see	him	again.”
“Relax.	I’m	just	joking.”
“You	may	be	joking,	but	you’re	still	sick.”
“Thank	you.	Have	another	drink.”	A	shapely	Asian	in	a	short,	tight	skirt	walks
by	and	we	both	have	a	look.	“Dibs,”	I	say.
The	 alcohol	 kicks	 in—it	 takes	 longer	 for	 her	 because	 she	 is	 naturally	 wound
tighter—and	Judith	manages	a	grin,	the	first	of	the	evening.	Could	be	the	first	of
the	week.	“Are	you	seeing	anyone?”	she	asks,	her	tone	noticeably	softer.
“Not	 since	 we	 last	 met,”	 I	 say.	 “It’s	 been	 all	 work.”	 My	 last	 girlfriend	 said
good-bye	three	years	ago.	I	get	lucky	occasionally,	but	I’d	be	lying	if	I	said	I	was	on
the	prowl	for	a	serious	woman.	There	is	a	long,	heavy	gap	in	the	conversation	as
we	get	bored.	When	we’re	down	to	the	last	few	drops	of	our	drinks,	we	go	back	to
Starcher	and	my	mother	and	the	next	weekend	that	we	both	now	dread.
We	walk	together	out	of	the	bar,	dutifully	peck	each	other	on	the	cheek,	and
say	good-bye.	Another	box	checked	off.
I	loved	her	once,	then	I	truly	hated	her.	Now	I	almost	like	Judith,	and	if	we
can	 continue	 these	 monthly	 meetings,	 we	 might	 become	 friends.	 That’s	 my	 goal,
because	I	really	need	a	friend,	one	who	can	understand	what	I	do	and	why	I	do	it.
And	it	would	be	much	better	for	our	son,	too.

7.
I	 live	 on	 the	 twenty-fifth	 floor	 of	 a	 downtown	 apartment	 building,	 with	 a
partial	 view	 of	 the	 river.	 I	 like	 it	 up	 here	 because	 it’s	 quiet	 and	 safe.	 If	 someone
wanted	to	bomb	or	burn	my	apartment,	it	would	be	difficult	without	taking	down
the	entire	building.	There	is	some	crime	downtown,	so	we	live	with	plenty	of	video
surveillance	and	guards	with	guns.	I	feel	secure.
They	fired	bullets	into	my	old	apartment,	a	duplex	on	the	ground	floor,	and
they	 firebombed	 my	 old	 office	 five	 years	 ago.	 “They”	 have	 never	 been	 found	 or
identified,	 and	 I	 get	 the	 clear	 impression	 the	 cops	 aren’t	 looking	 that	 hard.	 As	 I
said,	my	line	of	work	inspires	hatred	and	there	are	people	out	there	who’d	love	to
see	me	suffer.	Some	of	these	people	hide	behind	badges.
The	apartment	has	a	thousand	square	feet,	with	two	small	bedrooms,	an	even
smaller	kitchen,	seldom	used,	and	a	living	area	that’s	barely	big	enough	to	hold	my
only	 substantial	 piece	 of	 furniture.	 I’m	 not	 sure	 a	 vintage	 pool	 table	 should	 be
classified	as	furniture,	but	it’s	my	apartment	and	I’ll	call	it	what	I	want.	It’s	nine
feet	long,	regulation	size,	and	was	built	in	1884	by	the	Oliver	L.	Briggs	company	in
Boston.	 I	 won	 it	 in	 a	 lawsuit,	 had	 it	 perfectly	 restored	 and	 then	 carefully
reassembled	smack	in	the	middle	of	my	den.	On	an	average	day,	or	when	I’m	not
away	 in	 cheap	 motels	 dodging	 death	 threats,	 I	 rack	 ’em	 up	 time	 after	 time	 and
practice	for	hours.	Shooting	pool	against	myself	is	an	escape,	a	stress	reliever,	and
cheap	therapy.	It’s	also	a	throwback	to	my	high	school	days	when	I	hung	out	at	a
place	called	The	Rack,	a	real	local	dive	that’s	been	around	for	decades.	It’s	an	oldfashioned	 pool	 hall	 with	 rows	 of	 tables,	 layers	 of	 smoke,	 spittoons,	 cheap	 beer,
some	 petty	 gambling,	 and	 a	 clientele	 that	 acts	 tough	 but	 knows	 how	 to	 behave.
The	 owner,	 Curly,	 is	 an	 old	 friend	 who’s	 always	 there	 and	 keeps	 it	 running
smoothly.
When	the	insomnia	hits	and	my	walls	are	closing	in,	I	can	often	be	found	at
The	 Rack	 at	 two	 in	 the	 morning	 playing	 nine	 ball	 alone,	 in	 another	 world	 and
quite	happy.
Not	tonight,	though.	I	glide	into	the	apartment,	floating	on	the	whiskey,	and
quickly	 change	 into	 my	 fight	 clothes—jeans,	 a	 black	 T-shirt,	 and	 a	 bright,	 shiny
yellow	 jacket	 that	 snaps	 at	 the	 waist,	 practically	 glows	 in	 the	 dark,	 and	 screams
“Tadeo	Zapate”	across	the	back.	I	pull	my	slightly	graying	hair	into	a	tight	ponytail
and	 stuff	 it	 under	 the	 T-shirt.	 I	 change	 glasses	 and	 select	 a	 pair	 rimmed	 in	 light
blue.	I	adjust	my	cap—also	a	bright	yellow	that	matches	the	jacket,	with	the	name
Zapate	 across	 the	 front.	 I	 feel	 sufficiently	 disguised	 and	 the	 evening	 should	 go
well.	Where	I’m	going	the	crowd	is	not	interested	in	misfit	lawyers.	There	will	be	a
lot	 of	 thugs	 there,	 a	 lot	 of	 folks	 with	 legal	 troubles	 past,	 present,	 and	 future,	 but
they’ll	never	notice	me.

It’s	another	sad	fact	of	my	life	that	I	often	leave	the	apartment	after	dark	with
some	sort	of	disguise—different	cap,	glasses,	hidden	hair,	even	a	fedora.
Partner	drives	me	to	the	old	city	auditorium,	eight	blocks	from	my	apartment,
and	 drops	 me	 off	 in	 an	 alley	 near	 the	 building.	 A	 crowd	 is	 swarming	 out	 front.
Loud	rap	booms	across	the	front	plaza.	Spotlights	sweep	maniacally	from	building
to	building.	Bright	digital	signs	advertise	the	main	event	and	the	undercard.
Tadeo	fights	fourth,	the	last	warm-up	before	the	main	event,	which	tonight	is
a	heavyweight	contest	that	is	selling	tickets	because	the	favorite	is	a	crazy	ex-NFL
player	 who’s	 well	 known	 in	 the	 area.	 I	 own	 25	 percent	 of	 Tadeo’s	 career,	 an
investment	 that	 cost	 me	 $30,000	 a	 year	 ago,	 and	 he	 hasn’t	 lost	 since.	 I’m	 also
betting	on	the	side	and	doing	quite	well.	If	he	wins	tonight,	his	cut	will	be	$6,000.
Half	of	that	if	he	loses.
In	 a	 hallway,	 somewhere	 deep	 under	 the	 arena,	 I	 hear	 two	 security	 guards
talking.	 One	 is	 claiming	 the	 evening	 is	 a	 sellout.	 Five	 thousand	 fans.	 I	 flash	 my
credentials	 and	 get	 waved	 through	 another	 door,	 then	 another.	 I	 enter	 the	 dark
locker	room	and	the	tension	hits	like	a	brick.	Tonight	we’re	assigned	to	one	half	of
a	long	room.	Tadeo	is	moving	up	in	the	world	of	mixed	martial	arts,	and	we’re	all
beginning	 to	 sense	 something	 big.	 He’s	 lying	 on	 a	 table,	 on	 his	 stomach,	 naked
except	for	his	boxers,	not	an	ounce	of	fat	on	his	130-pound	body.	His	cousin	Leo	is
massaging	 his	 shoulder	 blades.	 The	 lotion	 makes	 his	 light	 brown	 skin	 glisten.	 I
ease	around	the	room	and	speak	to	Norberto,	his	manager,	Oscar,	his	trainer,	and
Miguel,	 his	 brother	 and	 workout	 partner.	 They	 smile	 when	 they	 speak	 to	 me
because	 I,	 the	 lone	 gringo,	 am	 viewed	 as	 the	 man	 with	 the	 money.	 I’m	 also	 the
agent,	the	guy	with	the	connections	and	brains	who’ll	get	Tadeo	on	a	UFC	card	if
he	 keeps	 winning.	 There	 are	 a	 couple	 of	 other	 relatives	 in	 the	 background,
hangers-on	 who	 have	 no	 discernible	 role	 in	 Tadeo’s	 life.	 I	 don’t	 like	 these	 extras
because	they	expect	to	be	paid	at	some	point,	but	after	seven	wins	in	a	row	Tadeo
thinks	he	needs	the	entourage.	They	all	do.
With	 the	 exception	 of	 Oscar,	 they’re	 all	 members	 of	 the	 same	 street	 gang,	 a
mid-level	organization	of	El	Salvadorans	who	run	cocaine.	Tadeo	has	been	one	of
the	 gang	 since	 he	 was	 initiated	 at	 the	 age	 of	 fifteen	 but	 has	 never	 aspired	 to	 a
leadership	position.	Instead,	he	found	some	old	boxing	gloves,	discovered	a	gym,
and	 then	 discovered	 he	 had	 freakishly	 quick	 hands.	 His	 brother	 Miguel	 also
boxed,	 but	 not	 as	 well.	 Miguel	 runs	 the	 gang	 and	 has	 a	 nasty	 reputation	 on	 the
street.
The	more	Tadeo	wins	the	more	he	earns,	and	the	more	I	worry	about	dealing
with	his	gang.
I	lean	down	and	speak	softly	to	him.	“How’s	my	man?”
He	 opens	 his	 eyes,	 looks	 up,	 suddenly	 smiles,	 and	 pulls	 out	 the	 earphones.
The	massage	ends	abruptly	as	he	sits	on	the	edge	of	the	table.	We	chat	for	a	few
moments	 and	 he	 assures	 me	 he’s	 ready	 to	 kill	 someone.	 Attaboy.	 His	 prefight

ritual	includes	avoiding	a	good	shave	for	a	week,	and	with	his	scraggly	beard	and
mop	of	black	hair	he	sort	of	reminds	me	of	the	great	Roberto	Duran.	But	Tadeo’s
roots	 are	 in	 El	 Salvador,	 not	 Panama.	 He’s	 twenty-two,	 a	 U.S.	 citizen,	 and	 his
English	is	almost	as	good	as	his	Spanish.	His	mother	has	documents	and	works	in
a	 cafeteria.	 She	 also	 has	 an	 apartment	 full	 of	 kids	 and	 relatives	 and	 I	 get	 the
impression	that	whatever	Tadeo	earns	gets	divided	many	ways.
Every	time	I	talk	to	Tadeo	I’m	thankful	I’m	not	forced	to	face	him	in	the	ring.
He	has	fierce	black	pupils	that	scream	angrily,	“Show	me	the	mayhem.	Show	me
the	blood.”	He	grew	up	on	the	streets,	fighting	anyone	who	got	too	close.	An	older
brother	died	in	a	knife	fight,	and	Tadeo	is	afraid	he’ll	die	too.	When	he	steps	into
the	 ring,	 he’s	 convinced	 someone	 is	 about	 to	 be	 killed,	 and	 it	 won’t	 be	 him.	 His
three	losses	were	on	points;	nobody’s	kicked	his	ass	yet.	He	trains	four	hours	a	day
and	he’s	close	to	mastering	jujitsu.
His	voice	is	low,	his	words	slow,	the	usual	prefight	jitters	where	fear	clouds	all
thoughts	and	your	stomach	churns.	I	know.	I’ve	been	there.	A	long	time	ago,	I	had
five	 Golden	 Gloves	 boxing	 matches.	 I	 was	 1–4	 until	 my	 mother	 found	 out	 about
my	secret	career	and	mercifully	brought	it	to	an	end.	But	I	did	it.	I	had	the	guts	to
step	into	the	ring	and	get	the	shit	knocked	out	of	me.
However,	 I	 cannot	 imagine	 the	 guts	 it	 takes	 to	 crawl	 into	 the	 cage	 with
another	 fighter	 who’s	 superbly	 conditioned,	 highly	 skilled,	 well	 trained,	 hungry,
nasty,	and	terrified	and	whose	only	thoughts	are	how	to	rip	your	shoulder	out	of
its	socket,	mangle	your	knees,	open	a	gash,	or	land	a	knockout	punch	on	the	jaw.
That’s	 why	 I	 love	 this	 sport.	 It	 takes	 more	 courage,	 more	 in-your-face	 raw	 guts,
than	 any	 sport	 since	 the	 gladiators	 battled	 to	 the	 death.	 Sure,	 many	 others	 are
dangerous—downhill	skiing,	football,	hockey,	boxing,	car	racing.	More	people	die
on	horses	each	year	than	in	any	other	sport.	But	in	those	you	don’t	willingly	enter
the	 game	 knowing	 you	 will	 get	 hurt.	 When	 you	 walk	 into	 the	 cage,	 you	 will	 get
hurt,	and	it	could	be	ugly,	painful,	even	deadly.	The	next	round	could	well	be	your
last.
That’s	 why	 the	 countdown	 is	 so	 brutal.	 The	 minutes	 drag	 by	 as	 the	 fighter
fights	his	nerves,	his	bowels,	his	fears.	The	waiting	is	the	worst	part.	I	leave	after	a
few	minutes	so	Tadeo	can	go	back	into	his	zone.	He	told	me	once	that	he’s	able	to
visualize	the	fight	and	he	sees	his	opponent	on	the	mat,	bleeding	and	screaming
for	mercy.
I	weave	through	the	maze	of	corridors	in	the	depths	of	the	arena,	and	I	can
hear	the	crowd	roaring	in	echoes,	thirsting	for	blood.	I	find	the	right	door	and	step
inside.	It’s	a	small	administrative	office	that’s	been	hijacked	by	my	own	little	street
gang.	 We	 meet	 before	 the	 fights	 and	 place	 our	 wagers.	 There	 are	 six	 of	 us,	 and
membership	 is	 closed	 because	 we	 don’t	 want	 any	 leaks.	 Some	 use	 their	 real
names,	 others	 do	 not.	 Slide	 dresses	 like	 a	 street	 pimp	 and	 has	 served	 time	 for
murder.	 Nino	 is	 a	 mid-level	 meth	 importer	 who	 served	 time	 for	 trafficking.
Johnny	has	no	criminal	record	(yet)	and	owns	half	of	the	fighter	Tadeo	will	face

tonight.	Denardo	drops	hints	of	Mafia	ties,	but	I	doubt	his	criminal	activity	is	that
well	 organized.	 He	 aspires	 to	 promote	 MMA	 events	 and	 longs	 to	 live	 in	 Vegas.
Frankie	is	the	old	guy,	a	local	fixture	in	the	fight	scene	for	decades.	He	admits	he’s
been	seduced	by	the	violence	of	cage	fighting	and	now	is	bored	with	old-fashioned
boxing.
So	 these	 are	 my	 boys.	 I	 wouldn’t	 trust	 any	 of	 these	 clowns	 in	 a	 legitimate
business	deal,	but	then	we’re	not	doing	anything	legitimate.	We	go	down	the	card
and	start	the	betting.	I	know	Tadeo	is	going	to	kill	Johnny’s	fighter,	and	evidently
Johnny	 is	 worried.	 I	 offer	 $5,000	 on	 Tadeo,	 and	 no	 one	 will	 take	 it.	 Three
thousand,	 and	 no	 takers.	 I	 chide	 them,	 cuss	 them,	 ridicule	 them,	 but	 they	 know
Tadeo	is	on	a	roll.	Johnny	has	to	wager	something,	and	I	finally	haggle	him	into	a
$4,000	bet	that	his	fighter	won’t	make	it	to	the	third	round.	Denardo	decides	he
wants	 some	 of	 this,	 for	 another	 $4,000.	 We	 cover	 the	 card	 with	 all	 manner	 of
wagers,	 and	 Frankie,	 the	 scribe,	 records	 it	 all.	 I	 leave	 the	 room	 with	 $12,000	 in
play,	 on	 four	 different	 fights.	 We’ll	 meet	 in	 the	 same	 room	 later	 when	 the	 fights
are	over	and	settle	up,	all	in	cash.
The	fights	begin	and	I	roam	around	the	arena,	killing	time.	The	tension	in	the
locker	room	is	insufferable	and	I	can’t	stand	to	be	in	there	as	the	clock	ticks	along.
I	 know	 that	 by	 now	 Tadeo	 is	 laid	 out	 on	 a	 table,	 motionless,	 covered	 by	 a	 thick
quilt,	saying	his	prayers	to	the	Virgin	Mary	and	listening	to	filthy	Latin	rap.	There
is	nothing	I	can	do	to	help,	so	I	find	a	spot	on	an	upper	level,	high	above	the	ring,
and	take	in	the	show.	It	is	indeed	a	sellout,	and	the	fans	are	as	loud	and	crazed	as
ever.	 Cage	 fighting	 appeals	 to	 the	 savage	 instinct	 in	 some	 people,	 including	 me,
and	we’re	all	here	for	the	same	reason—to	see	one	fighter	annihilate	another.	We
want	to	see	bleeding	eyes,	gashes	across	the	forehead,	choke	holds,	bone-ripping
submissions,	 and	 brutal	 knockout	 punches	 that	 send	 the	 corners	 scrambling	 for
the	 doctor.	 Mix	 in	 a	 flood	 of	 cheap	 beer,	 and	 you	 have	 five	 thousand	 maniacs
begging	for	blood.
I	eventually	work	my	way	back	to	the	locker	room,	where	things	are	coming	to
life.	 The	 first	 two	 fights	 ended	 with	 early	 knockouts,	 so	 the	 evening	 is	 moving
quickly.	Norberto,	Oscar,	and	Miguel	put	on	their	glowing	yellow	jackets,	same	as
mine,	and	Team	Zapate	is	ready	for	the	long	walk	to	the	cage.	I’ll	be	in	the	corner,
along	with	Norberto	and	Oscar,	though	my	role	is	not	as	important.	I	make	sure
Tadeo	has	water	while	Norberto	yells	instructions	in	the	fastest	Spanish	you’ll	ever
hear.	Oscar	tends	to	the	facial	wounds,	if	any.	From	the	moment	we	hit	the	floor,
everything	 becomes	 a	 blur.	 Along	 the	 tunnel,	 drunk	 fans	 reach	 for	 Tadeo	 and
scream	his	name.	Cops	shove	people	out	of	our	way.	The	roar	is	earsplitting,	and
it’s	not	all	for	Tadeo.	They	want	more,	another	fight,	preferably	one	to	the	death.
Outside	the	cage,	an	official	checks	Tadeo’s	gloves,	applies	oil	to	his	face,	and
gives	him	the	green	light.	An	announcer	yells	his	name	over	the	PA,	and	our	man
bounces	into	the	cage	in	his	bright	yellow	trunks	and	robe.	His	opponent	tonight
goes	 by	 “the	 Jackal,”	 real	 name	 unknown	 and	 unimportant.	 He’s	 a	 submission

specialist,	 a	 tall	 white	 guy	 without	 much	 bulk,	 but	 looks	 are	 deceiving.	 I’ve	 seen
him	fight	three	times	and	he’s	guileful	and	crafty.	He	plays	defense	well	and	looks
for	a	takedown.	He	wrapped	his	last	opponent	into	a	pretzel	and	made	him	scream
for	mercy.	Right	now	I	loathe	the	Jackal,	but	deep	down	I	admire	the	hell	out	of
him.	 Any	 man	 who	 can	 climb	 into	 the	 cage	 has	 far	 more	 spine	 than	 the	 average
guy.
The	 bell	 rings	 for	 round	 1,	 three	 minutes	 of	 fury.	 Tadeo	 the	 boxer	 bores	 in
straight	ahead	and	immediately	has	the	Jackal	backing	up.	Both	jab	and	spar	for
the	first	minute,	then	tie	up	but	there’s	no	damage.	Like	the	other	five	thousand
fans,	I’m	yelling	my	head	off,	though	I	have	no	idea	why.	Any	advice	is	useless	and
Tadeo	isn’t	listening	anyway.	They	go	down,	land	hard,	and	the	Jackal	has	him	in
a	scissors	hold.	For	a	long	minute,	the	action	dies	as	Tadeo	squirms	and	wiggles
and	we	hold	our	breath.	He	finally	breaks	free	and	manages	a	sharp	left	jab	to	the
Jackal’s	 nose.	 Finally,	 there’s	 blood.	 There’s	 no	 question	 my	 man	 is	 the	 better
fighter,	but	it	just	takes	one	mistake	and	you’ve	got	an	arm	twisted	to	the	breaking
point.	Between	rounds,	Norberto	unloads	a	torrent	of	instructions,	but	Tadeo	isn’t
listening.	He	knows	much	more	about	fighting	than	any	of	us,	and	he’s	got	the	guy
figured	out.	When	the	bell	rings	for	round	2,	I	grab	him	by	the	arm	and	yell	into
his	ear,	“Take	him	in	this	round	and	there’s	an	extra	two	thousand	bucks.”	This,
Tadeo	hears.
The	Jackal	lost	the	first	round,	so,	like	many	fighters,	he	starts	pressing	in	the
second	round.	He	wants	to	get	inside,	to	get	his	wiry	arms	fixed	into	some	manner
of	vile	death	grip,	but	Tadeo	reads	him	perfectly.	Thirty	seconds	in,	Tadeo	does	a
classic	 left-right-left	 combo	 and	 knocks	 his	 opponent	 squarely	 onto	 his	 butt.
Tadeo	 then	 makes	 a	 common	 mistake	 as	 he	 attempts	 to	 launch	 himself	 like	 an
idiot	 onto	 the	 Jackal,	 much	 like	 a	 manic	 dive-bomber	 lunging	 for	 the	 kill.	 The
Jackal	manages	to	kick	with	his	right	foot,	a	brutal	blow	that	hits	Tadeo	just	above
the	crotch.	He	stays	on	his	feet	as	the	Jackal	scrambles	to	his,	and	for	a	second	or
two	 neither	 man	 pushes	 the	 action.	 They	 finally	 shake	 it	 off	 and	 begin	 circling.
Tadeo	finds	his	boxer’s	rhythm	and	begins	peppering	the	Jackal	with	unanswered
jabs.	 He	 opens	 a	 cut	 above	 his	 right	 eye	 and	 widens	 it	 with	 a	 relentless	 barrage.
The	Jackal	has	the	bad	habit	of	throwing	a	wild	fake	left	hook	just	before	he	ducks
and	comes	in	low	at	the	knees,	and	he	tries	this	one	time	too	often.	Tadeo	reads	it,
times	 it	 perfectly,	 and	 executes	 his	 finest	 trick,	 a	 blind	 elbow	 spin,	 a	 move	 that
takes	balls	because	for	a	split	second	his	back	is	turned	to	his	opponent.	But	the
Jackal	is	too	slow	and	Tadeo’s	right	elbow	crushes	into	the	right	jaw.	Lights	out.
The	Jackal	is	out	before	he	lands	on	the	mat.	The	rules	allow	Tadeo	to	pounce	on
him	for	a	few	shots	to	the	face,	to	properly	finish	him	off,	but	why	bother?	Tadeo
just	stands	in	the	center	of	the	ring,	hands	raised,	staring	down,	admiring	his	work
as	the	Jackal	lies	as	still	as	a	corpse.	The	referee	is	quick	to	stop	it	all.
Somewhat	nervously,	we	wait	a	few	moments	as	they	try	and	revive	him.	The
crowd	 wants	 a	 stretcher,	 a	 casualty,	 something	 to	 talk	 about	 at	 work,	 but	 the
Jackal	eventually	comes	to	life	and	starts	talking.	He	sits	up,	and	we	relax.	Or	try

to.	 It’s	 not	 easy	 staying	 calm	 in	 the	 aftermath	 of	 such	 furious	 action,	 when	 you
have	something	at	stake,	and	when	five	thousand	maniacs	are	stomping	their	feet.
The	Jackal	gets	to	his	feet	and	the	maniacs	boo.
Tadeo	walks	over	to	him,	says	something	nice,	and	they	make	peace.
As	we	leave	the	cage,	I	follow	Tadeo	and	smile	as	he	slaps	hands	with	his	fans
and	soaks	up	another	win.	He	made	a	couple	of	boneheaded	moves	that	would	get
him	killed	against	a	ranked	opponent,	but	all	in	all	it	was	another	promising	fight.
I	try	and	savor	the	moment	and	think	about	the	future	and	the	potential	earnings,
maybe	some	sponsorships.	He’s	the	fourth	fighter	I’ve	invested	in	and	the	first	one
who’s	paying	off.
Just	before	we	leave	the	floor	and	enter	the	tunnel,	a	female	voice	yells,	“Mr.
Rudd!	Mr.	Rudd!”
It	 takes	 a	 second	 or	 two	 for	 this	 to	 register	 because	 no	 one	 in	 this	 crowd
should	 possibly	 recognize	 me.	 I’m	 wearing	 an	 official	 Team	 Zapate	 trucker-style
rap	 cap,	 a	 hideous	 yellow	 jacket,	 and	 different	 eyeglasses,	 and	 my	 long	 hair	 is
tucked	away.	But	by	the	time	I	pause	and	look,	she’s	reaching	for	me.	A	heavyset
woman	of	twenty-five	with	purple	hair,	piercings,	enormous	boobs	exploding	from
just	under	a	skintight	T-shirt,	pretty	much	the	typical	classy	gal	at	the	cage	fights.
I	give	her	a	curious	look	and	she	again	says,	“Mr.	Rudd.	Aren’t	you	Mr.	Rudd,	the
lawyer?”
I	nod.	She	takes	a	step	even	closer	and	says,	“My	mother	is	on	the	jury.”
“What	jury?”	I	ask,	suddenly	panicked.	There’s	only	one	jury	at	the	moment.
“We’re	from	Milo.	The	Gardy	Baker	trial.	My	mom’s	on	the	jury.”
I	jerk	my	head	to	the	left,	as	if	to	say,	“That	way.”	Seconds	later	we’re	off	the
floor	and	walking	side	by	side	along	a	narrow	corridor	as	the	walls	shake	around
us.	“What’s	her	name?”	I	ask,	watching	everyone	who	passes.
“Glynna	Roston,	juror	number	eight.”
“Okay.”	 I	 know	 every	 juror’s	 name,	 age,	 race,	 job,	 education,	 family,
residence,	marital	history,	prior	jury	service,	and	criminal	record,	if	any.	I	helped
select	 them.	 Some	 I	 wanted,	 most	 I	 did	 not.	 I	 have	 been	 sitting	 in	 a	 packed
courtroom	 with	 them	 five	 days	 a	 week	 for	 the	 past	 two	 weeks,	 and	 I’m	 really
getting	 tired	 of	 them.	 I	 think	 I	 know	 their	 politics,	 religions,	 biases,	 and	 feelings
about	criminal	justice.	Because	I	know	so	damn	much,	I’ve	been	convinced	since
they	were	seated	that	Gardy	Baker	is	headed	for	death	row.
“What’s	Glynna	thinking	these	days?”	I	ask	cautiously.	She	could	be	wearing	a
mike.	Nothing	surprises	me.
“She	 thinks	 they’re	 all	 a	 bunch	 of	 liars.”	 We’re	 still	 walking,	 slowly,	 going
nowhere,	 each	 afraid	 to	 look	 the	 other	 in	 the	 eyes.	 I	 am	 stunned	 to	 hear	 this.
Reading	 her	 body	 language	 and	 knowing	 her	 background,	 I	 would	 bet	 the	 farm

that	Glynna	Roston	would	be	the	first	to	yell	“Guilty!”
I	 look	 behind	 us	 to	 make	 sure	 there’s	 no	 witness,	 then	 say,	 “Well,	 she’s	 a
smart	woman	because	they	are	lying.	They	have	no	proof.”
“Do	you	want	me	to	tell	her	that?”
“I	don’t	care	what	you	tell	her,”	I	say,	looking	around	as	we	stop	and	wait	for
one	of	the	heavyweights	to	pass	with	his	entourage.	I	have	$2,000	on	the	guy.	I’m
up	$6,000	for	the	night	and	I’m	feeling	pretty	good.	And	to	top	it	off,	I’m	hearing
the	shocking	news	that	not	all	of	my	Gardy	Baker	jurors	are	brain-dead.
I	ask,	“Is	she	alone,	or	does	she	have	buddies?”
“She	says	they’re	not	discussing	the	case.”
I	 want	 to	 laugh	 at	 this.	 If	 she’s	 not	 discussing	 the	 case,	 then	 how	 does	 this
cutie	know	how	her	mother’s	leaning?	At	this	precise	moment,	I	am	violating	the
rules	of	ethics	and	perhaps	a	criminal	statute	as	well.	This	is	unauthorized	contact
with	 a	 juror,	 and	 though	 it’s	 not	 clear-cut,	 and	 not	 instigated	 by	 me,	 there’s	 no
doubt	 it	 would	 be	 interpreted	 badly	 by	 the	 state	 bar	 association.	 And	 Judge
Kaufman	would	blow	a	gasket.
“Tell	 her	 to	 stick	 to	 her	 guns	 because	 they’ve	 got	 the	 wrong	 guy,”	 I	 say,	 and
walk	 away.	 I	 don’t	 know	 what	 she	 wants	 and	 there	 is	 nothing	 I	 can	 give	 her.	 I
guess	I	could	take	ten	minutes	and	point	out	the	glaring	deficiencies	in	the	State’s
evidence,	 but	 that	 would	 require	 her	 to	 absorb	 it	 all	 correctly	 and	 then	 give	 an
accurate	report	to	her	mother.	Fat	chance.	This	gal	is	here	for	the	fights.
I	 take	 the	 nearest	 stairway	 to	 a	 lower	 level,	 and	 as	 soon	 as	 I’m	 safely	 away
from	her,	I	duck	into	a	restroom	and	replay	what	she	said.	I	still	can’t	believe	it.
That	 jury,	 along	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 town,	 convicted	 my	 client	 the	 day	 he	 was
arrested.	 Her	 mother,	 Glynna	 Roston,	 gives	 every	 indication	 of	 being	 the	 model
Milo	citizen—uneducated,	narrow-minded,	and	determined	to	be	a	heroine	for	her
community	 in	 its	 time	 of	 need.	 Monday	 morning	 will	 be	 interesting.	 At	 some
point,	after	we	resume	testimony,	I’ll	get	the	chance	to	glance	into	the	jury	box.	So
far	Glynna	has	not	been	afraid	to	return	my	looks.	Her	eyes	will	reveal	something,
though	I’m	not	sure	what.
I	shake	it	off	and	return	to	reality.	The	heavyweight	fight	lasts	for	a	full	forty
seconds	 with	 my	 favorite	 still	 standing.	 I	 can’t	 wait	 to	 reconvene	 with	 my	 little
gang.	We	meet	in	the	same	dark	room	with	the	door	locked,	and	the	trash	talk	is
brutal.	All	six	of	us	pull	cash	from	our	pockets.	Frankie	has	the	notes	and	keeps	it
all	straight.	For	the	evening,	I’ve	netted	$8,000	from	my	wagers,	though	$2,000
of	this	will	go	to	Tadeo	for	his	impromptu	bonus.	I’ll	get	it	back	from	his	cut	of	the
purse.	That	will	go	on	the	books	for	IRS	purposes;	this	cash	will	not.
Tadeo	 earns	 $8,000	 for	 his	 efforts,	 a	 great	 night	 that	 will	 allow	 him	 to	 add
another	 gang	 member	 to	 his	 entourage.	 He’ll	 pay	 some	 bills,	 keep	 the	 family
afloat,	save	nothing.	I’ve	tried	to	offer	financial	advice,	but	it’s	a	waste	of	time.

I	 stop	 by	 the	 locker	 room,	 hand	 over	 the	 $2,000,	 tell	 him	 I	 love	 him,	 and
leave	the	arena.	Partner	and	I	go	to	a	quiet	bar	and	have	some	drinks.	It	takes	a
couple	to	settle	me	down.	When	you’re	that	close	to	the	action,	and	you’ve	got	your
own	hitter	in	the	ring	two	seconds	away	from	a	concussion	or	a	broken	bone,	and
five	thousand	idiots	are	screaming	into	your	ears,	your	heart	races	wildly	as	your
stomach	flips	and	your	nerves	tingle.	There’s	a	flood	of	adrenaline	like	nothing	I’ve
ever	felt.

8.
Jack	 Peeley	 is	 a	 former	 boyfriend	 of	 the	 mother	 of	 the	 two	 Fentress	 girls.
Their	 father	 was	 long	 gone	 when	 they	 were	 murdered,	 and	 their	 mother’s
apartment	 was	 a	 revolving	 door	 for	 local	 tomcats	 and	 slimeballs.	 Peeley	 lasted
about	a	year	and	got	the	boot	when	she	met	a	used-tractor	dealer	with	a	little	cash
and	a	house	without	wheels.	She	moved	up	and	Peeley	moved	out,	with	a	broken
heart.	He	was	the	last	person	seen	near	the	girls	when	they	disappeared.	Early	on,
I	asked	the	police	why	they	did	not	treat	him	as	a	suspect,	or	at	least	investigate
him,	and	their	lame	response	was	that	they	already	had	their	man.	Gardy	was	in
custody	and	confessing	right	and	left.
I	strongly	suspect	Jack	Peeley	killed	the	girls	in	some	sick	act	of	revenge.	And,
if	the	cops	had	not	stumbled	onto	Gardy,	they	might	have	eventually	questioned
Peeley.	 Gardy,	 though,	 with	 his	 frightening	 appearance,	 satanic	 leanings,	 and
history	of	sexual	perversion,	became	the	clear	favorite	and	Milo	has	never	looked
back.
According	to	the	Bishop,	who	is	relying	on	his	low-life	sources,	Peeley	hangs
out	 almost	 every	 Saturday	 night	 at	 a	 joint	 called	 the	 Blue	 &	 White.	 It’s	 about	 a
mile	east	of	Milo	and	was	originally	a	truck	stop.	Now	it’s	just	a	redneck	dive	with
cheap	beer,	pool	tables,	and	live	music	on	the	weekends.
On	Saturday	night,	we	ease	into	the	gravel	parking	lot	at	around	ten,	and	the
place	is	packed,	wall-to-wall	pickups.	We	have	our	own,	a	rented	Dodge	club	cab
with	 Ram	 power	 and	 big	 tires,	 perhaps	 a	 bit	 too	 shiny	 for	 this	 joint	 but	 then	 it
belongs	to	Hertz,	not	me.	Behind	the	wheel,	Partner	is	pretending	to	be	a	redneck
but	is	a	pathetic	excuse	for	one.	He’s	ditched	his	daily	black	garb	and	is	wearing
jeans	and	a	Cowboys	T-shirt,	but	it’s	not	working.
“Let’s	 do	 it,”	 I	 say	 from	 the	 front	 passenger’s	 seat.	 Tadeo	 and	 Miguel	 jump
from	 the	 rear	 seat	 and	 casually	 walk	 through	 the	 front	 door.	 They’re	 met	 just
inside	by	a	bouncer	who	wants	ten	bucks	each	for	the	cover.	He	looks	them	over
and	 does	 not	 approve.	 They	 are,	 after	 all,	 darker-skinned	 Hispanics.	 But	 at	 least
they’re	 not	 black.	 According	 to	 the	 Bishop,	 the	 Blue	 &	 White	 will	 tolerate	 a	 few
Mexicans	 but	 a	 black	 face	 would	 start	 a	 riot.	 Not	 that	 there’s	 anything	 to	 worry
about.	Such	a	cracker	dive	has	zero	appeal	to	any	sensible	black	guy.
But	 a	 riot	 is	 what	 they’ll	 get	 anyway.	 Tadeo	 and	 Miguel	 order	 a	 beer	 at	 the
crowded	bar	and	do	a	passable	job	blending	in.	They	get	some	stares	but	nothing
bad.	If	these	fat,	drunk	rednecks	only	knew.	Tadeo	could	take	out	any	five	with	his
bare	hands	in	less	than	a	minute.	Miguel,	his	brother	and	sparring	partner,	could
take	out	four.	After	fifteen	minutes	of	surveying	the	crowd	and	getting	the	layout,
Tadeo	flags	a	bartender	over	and	says	in	unaccented	English,	“Say,	I	need	to	get
some	money	to	a	guy	named	Jack	Peeley,	but	I’m	not	sure	I	can	recognize	him.”

The	bartender,	a	busy	man,	nods	to	a	row	of	booths	near	the	pool	table	and
says,	“Third	booth,	the	guy	with	the	black	cap	on.”
“Thanks.”
“No	problem.”
They	order	another	beer	and	kill	some	time.	In	Peeley’s	booth	there	are	two
women	and	one	other	man.	The	table	is	covered	with	empty	beer	bottles,	and	all
four	 are	 chomping	 away	 on	 roasted	 peanuts.	 Part	 of	 the	 ambience	 of	 the	 Blue	 &
White	 is	 that	 you	 toss	 your	 empty	 shells	 onto	 the	 floor.	 At	 the	 far	 end	 a	 band
cranks	up	and	a	dozen	folks	ease	that	way	for	a	dance.	Evidently,	Peeley	is	not	a
dancer.	Tadeo	sends	me	a	text:	“JP	spotted.	Waiting.”
They	kill	some	more	time.	Partner	and	I	sit	and	watch	and	wait,	nervous	as
hell.	Who	can	predict	the	outcome	of	a	brawl	in	a	roomful	of	drunken	idiots,	half
of	whom	carry	NRA	membership	cards?
Peeley	 and	 his	 buddy	 head	 to	 a	 pool	 table	 and	 get	 ready	 for	 a	 game.	 Their
women	stay	in	the	booth,	eating	peanuts,	swilling	beer.	“Here	we	go,”	Tadeo	says
and	drifts	away	from	the	bar.	He	walks	between	two	pool	tables,	times	it	perfectly,
and	bumps	hard	into	Peeley,	who’s	minding	his	own	business	and	chalking	up	his
cue.	“What	the	hell!”	Peeley	yells	angrily,	hot-faced	and	ready	to	kick	a	wetback’s
ass.	Before	he	can	swing	his	cue,	Tadeo	hits	him	with	three	punches	that	no	one
can	 possibly	 see.	 Left-right-left,	 each	 landing	 on	 an	 eyebrow,	 where	 the	 cuts	 are
always	 easier,	 each	 drawing	 blood.	 Peeley	 goes	 down	 hard	 and	 it	 will	 be	 a	 while
before	 he	 wakes	 up.	 The	 women	 scream	 and	 there’s	 the	 usual	 rumble	 of	 activity
and	loud	voices	as	a	melee	unfolds.	Peeley’s	friend	is	slow	to	react	but	finally	pulls
back	 his	 stick	 to	 take	 off	 Tadeo’s	 head.	 Miguel,	 though,	 intervenes	 and	 lands	 a
hard	 fist	 at	 the	 base	 of	 his	 skull.	 Peeley’s	 friend	 joins	 Peeley	 on	 the	 floor.	 Tadeo
pounds	Peeley’s	face	a	few	more	times	for	good	measure,	then	ducks	low	and	darts
into	 the	 men’s	 restroom.	 A	 beer	 bottle	 cracks	 and	 splashes	 just	 above	 his	 head.
Miguel	 is	 right	 behind	 him,	 angry	 voices	 calling	 after	 them.	 They	 lock	 the	 door,
then	scramble	through	a	window.	They’re	back	in	the	pickup	seconds	later,	and	we
casually	drive	away.
“Got	 it,”	 Tadeo	 says	 eagerly	 from	 the	 backseat.	 He	 thrusts	 his	 right	 hand
forward	and	it	is	indeed	covered	with	blood.	Peeley’s	blood.	We	stop	at	a	burger
place,	and	I	carefully	scrape	it	clean.
It’s	midnight	before	we	make	it	back	to	the	City.

The	 monster	 who	 killed	 the	 Fentress	 girls	 bound	 their	 ankles	 and	 wrists
together	with	their	shoelaces,	then	threw	them	in	a	pond.	During	Jenna’s	autopsy,
a	single	strand	of	long	black	hair	was	found	wrapped	up	in	the	laces	around	her
ankles.	Both	she	and	Raley	had	light	blond	hair.	At	the	time,	Gardy	had	long	black
hair—though	 the	 color	 changed	 monthly—and	 not	 surprisingly	 the	 State’s	 hair
analysis	expert	testified	that	there	was	a	“match.”	For	over	a	century,	true	experts
have	 known	 that	 hair	 analysis	 is	 wildly	 inaccurate.	 It	 is	 still	 used	 by	 authorities,
even	 the	 FBI,	 when	 there’s	 no	 better	 proof	 and	 the	 suspect	 has	 to	 be	 nailed.	 I
begged	 Judge	 Kaufman	 to	 order	 DNA	 testing	 with	 a	 sample	 of	 Gardy’s	 current
hair,	but	he	refused.	Said	it	was	too	expensive.	We’re	talking	about	a	man’s	life.
When	 I	 was	 finally	 allowed	 to	 view	 the	 State’s	 evidence,	 of	 which	 there	 was
virtually	 none,	 I	 managed	 to	 steal	 about	 three-quarters	 of	 an	 inch	 of	 the	 black
hair.	No	one	missed	it.
Early	Monday	morning,	I	ship	by	overnight	parcel	the	hair	and	the	sample	of
Jack	Peeley’s	blood	to	a	DNA	lab	in	California.	It	will	cost	me	$6,000	for	a	rush
job.	I’ll	bet	the	ranch	I	find	the	real	killer.

10.
Partner	and	I	speed	away	to	Milo	for	another	grueling	week	of	lies.	I’m	eager
to	get	my	first	glance	at	Glynna	Roston,	juror	number	eight,	and	see	if	there	are
any	telltale	signs	of	backdoor	communications.	Typically,	though,	things	do	not	go
as	planned.
The	 courtroom	 is	 once	 again	 packed	 and	 I	 marvel	 at	 the	 crowd.	 For	 the
eleventh	 court	 day	 in	 a	 row,	 Julie	 Fentress,	 the	 mother	 of	 the	 twins,	 sits	 on	 the
front	bench,	directly	behind	the	prosecutor’s	table.	She’s	with	her	support	group
and	they	glare	at	me	as	if	I	killed	the	girls	myself.
When	 Trots	 finally	 arrives	 and	 opens	 his	 briefcase	 and	 goes	 through	 the
motions	of	pretending	to	be	of	some	value,	I	lean	down	and	tell	him,	“Watch	juror
number	eight,	Glynna	Roston,	but	don’t	get	caught.”	Trots	will	get	caught	because
Trots	is	a	blockhead.	He	should	be	able	to	covertly	glance	at	the	jurors	and	gauge
their	 reactions,	 study	 their	 body	 language,	 see	 if	 they’re	 awake	 or	 interested	 or
pissed,	do	all	the	things	you	learn	to	do	in	a	trial	when	you’re	curious	about	your
jury,	but	Trots	checked	out	weeks	ago.
Gardy	is	in	relatively	good	spirits.	He’s	told	me	he	enjoys	the	trial	because	it
gets	him	out	of	his	cell.	They	keep	him	locked	down	in	solitary,	usually	with	the
lights	 off	 because	 they	 know	 he	 killed	 the	 Fentress	 twins	 and	 the	 harsh
punishment	should	start	now.	My	spirits	are	better	because	Gardy	took	a	shower
over	the	weekend.
We	kill	some	time	waiting	for	Judge	Kaufman.	Huver,	the	prosecutor,	is	not
at	 his	 table	 at	 9:15.	 His	 gang	 of	 Hitler	 Youth	 assistants	 have	 deeper	 frowns	 than
usual.	 Something	 is	 going	 on.	 A	 bailiff	 appears	 and	 whispers	 to	 me,	 “Judge
Kaufman	wants	to	see	you	in	chambers.”	This	happens	almost	every	day,	it	seems.
We	run	back	to	chambers	to	fistfight	over	something	we	want	to	keep	away	from
the	public.	But	why	bother?	After	two	weeks,	I	know	that	if	Huver	wants	the	crowd
to	see	or	hear	something,	it’s	going	to	happen.
I	 walk	 into	 an	 ambush.	 The	 court	 reporter	 is	 there,	 ready	 to	 capture	 it	 all.
Judge	Kaufman	is	pacing,	in	his	shirt	and	tie,	robe	and	coat	hanging	on	the	door.
Huver	stands	smug	and	grim-faced	by	a	window.	The	bailiff	shuts	the	door	behind
me	and	Kaufman	throws	some	papers	on	the	table.	“Read	this!”	he	growls.
“Good	morning,	Judge,”	I	say,	as	smart-ass	as	possible.	“Huver.”
They	 do	 not	 respond.	 It’s	 a	 two-page	 affidavit	 in	 which	 the	 deponent,	 or	 in
this	 case	 the	 liar,	 claims	 she	 bumped	 into	 me	 the	 previous	 Friday	 night	 at	 the
MMA	fights	in	the	City,	and	that	I	discussed	the	case	with	her	and	told	her	to	tell
her	 mother,	 a	 juror,	 that	 the	 State	 had	 no	 evidence	 and	 all	 their	 witnesses	 were
lying.	She	signed	it	Marlo	Wilfang	before	a	notary	public.

“Any	truth	to	it,	Mr.	Rudd?”	Kaufman	growls,	really	steamed	up.
“Oh,	a	little,	I	suppose.”
“You	 wanna	 tell	 your	 side	 of	 the	 story?”	 he	 asks,	 obviously	 not	 ready	 to
believe	a	word	I	say.	Huver	mumbles	loud	enough	to	be	heard,	“Clear	case	of	jury
tampering.”
To	 which	 I	 snap,	 “You	 wanna	 hear	 my	 side	 first	 or	 you	 wanna	 string	 me	 up
without	all	the	facts,	same	as	Gardy?”
Judge	Kaufman	says,	“That’s	enough.	Knock	it	off,	Mr.	Huver.”
I	 tell	 my	 version,	 accurately,	 perfectly,	 without	 a	 single	 word	 of
embellishment.	I	make	the	point	that	I’ve	never	met	this	woman,	wouldn’t	know
her	 from	 Eve—how	 could	 I?—and	 that	 she	 deliberately	 sought	 me	 out,	 initiated
the	 contact,	 then	 couldn’t	 wait	 to	 hustle	 back	 home	 to	 Milo	 and	 try	 to	 insert
herself	into	this	trial.
Often	it	takes	a	village	to	properly	convict	a	killer.
Almost	 yelling,	 I	 say,	 “She	 says	 here	 I	 initiated	 contact?	 How?	 I	 don’t	 know
this	 woman.	 She	 knows	 me	 because	 she’s	 been	 in	 the	 courtroom,	 watching	 the
trial.	She	can	recognize	me.	How	am	I	supposed	to	recognize	her?	Does	this	make
any	sense?”
It	 doesn’t,	 of	 course,	 but	 Huver	 and	 Kaufman	 won’t	 budge.	 They	 are
convinced	they	have	me	nailed.	Their	hatred	of	me	and	my	client	is	so	intense	they
can’t	see	the	obvious.
I	hammer	away:	“She’s	lying,	okay?	She	deliberately	planned	all	of	this.	She
bumped	 into	 me,	 had	 a	 conversation,	 then	 prepared	 this	 affidavit,	 probably	 in
your	 office,	 Huver,	 and	 she	 is	 lying.	 That’s	 perjury	 and	 contempt	 of	 court.	 Do
something,	Judge.”
“I	don’t	need	you	to	tell	me—”
“Oh,	come	on.	Get	up	off	your	ass	and	do	the	right	thing	for	a	change.”
“Listen,	Mr.	Rudd,”	he	says,	red-faced	and	ready	to	take	a	swing	at	me.	I	want
a	 mistrial	 at	 this	 point.	 I	 want	 to	 provoke	 these	 two	 into	 doing	 something	 really
stupid.
Loudly,	I	say,	“I	want	a	hearing.	Keep	the	jury	out,	call	this	fine	young	lady	to
the	witness	stand,	and	let	me	cross-examine	her.	She	wants	to	get	involved	in	this
trial,	bring	her	on.	Her	mother	is	obviously	biased	and	unstable	and	I	want	her	off
the	jury.”
“What	did	you	say	to	her?”	Kaufman	asked.
“I	just	told	you,	word	for	word.	I	told	her	the	same	thing	I	would	say	to	any
other	person	on	the	face	of	this	earth—your	case	is	built	on	nothing	but	a	bunch	of
lying	witnesses	and	you	have	no	credible	proof.	Period.”

“You’ve	lost	your	mind,”	Huver	says.
“I	want	a	hearing,”	I	practically	yell.	“I	want	this	woman	off	the	jury	and	I	will
not	proceed	with	the	trial	until	she’s	gone.”
“Are	you	threatening	me?”	Kaufman	asks	as	things	spin	rapidly	out	of	control.
“No,	sir.	I	am	promising	you.	I	will	not	continue.”
“Then	I’ll	hold	you	in	contempt	and	throw	you	in	jail.”
“I’ve	 been	 there	 before.	 Do	 it,	 and	 we’ll	 have	 ourselves	 a	 mistrial.	 We	 can
come	back	in	six	months	and	have	this	party	all	over	again.”
They	don’t	know	for	sure	that	I’ve	been	in	jail,	but	at	this	moment	they	figure
I’m	not	lying.	A	fringe	lawyer	like	me	is	constantly	flirting	with	ethical	boundaries.
Jail	time	is	a	badge	of	honor.	If	I’m	forced	to	anger	a	judge,	or	humiliate	him,	so
be	it.
We	 go	 silent	 for	 a	 few	 minutes.	 The	 court	 reporter	 stares	 at	 her	 feet,	 and	 if
given	 the	 chance	 she	 would	 sprint	 from	 the	 room,	 knocking	 over	 chairs	 in	 the
process.	 At	 this	 point,	 Huver	 is	 terrified	 of	 a	 reversal,	 of	 having	 his	 great
conviction	frowned	upon	by	an	appellate	court	that	sends	it	back	for	another	trial.
He	 doesn’t	 want	 to	 relive	 this	 ordeal.	 What	 he	 wants	 is	 that	 glorious	 date	 in	 the
future	 when	 he	 drives,	 probably	 with	 a	 reporter	 in	 the	 car	 with	 him,	 to	 a	 prison
called	 Big	 Wheeler,	 where	 the	 State	 keeps	 its	 death	 house.	 He’ll	 be	 treated	 like
royalty	because	he	will	be	the	Man—the	gunslinger	who	solved	the	hideous	crime
and	 secured	 the	 guilty	 verdict	 that	 sent	 Gardy	 Baker	 to	 his	 execution,	 thus
allowing	Milo	to	have	its	closure.	He’ll	be	given	a	front-row	seat	behind	a	curtain
that	will	be	dramatically	pulled	aside	to	reveal	Gardy	lying	on	a	gurney	with	tubes
in	 his	 arms.	 Afterward,	 he,	 Huver,	 will	 find	 the	 time	 to	 chat	 somberly	 with	 the
press	and	describe	the	burdens	his	office	places	upon	him.	He	has	yet	to	witness
an	execution,	and	in	this	death-happy	state	that’s	worse	than	being	a	thirty-yearold	 virgin.	 State	 v.	 Gardy	 Baker	 is	 Dan	 Huver’s	 finest	 hour.	 It	 will	 make	 his
career.	 He’ll	 get	 to	 speak	 at	 those	 all-important	 prosecutors’	 conferences	 held	 in
cheap	casinos.	He’ll	get	reelected.
At	the	moment,	though,	he’s	sweating	because	he	has	overplayed	his	hand.
They	were	convinced	they	had	me	by	the	balls.	What	foolishness.	Nailing	me
with	some	bogus	improper	contact	charge	will	not	help	their	case	and	cause	at	this
point.	 It’s	 overkill,	 and	 it’s	 not	 unusual.	 They	 have	 Gardy	 all	 but	 convicted	 and
sentenced	to	die,	and	for	fun	they	thought	it	would	be	cute	to	take	a	bite	out	of	me.
“Smells	 like	 improper	 contact	 to	 me,	 Judge,”	 Huver	 says,	 trying	 to	 be
dramatic.
“It	would,”	I	say.
“Let’s	deal	with	it	later,”	Kaufman	says.	“The	jury	is	waiting.”
I	 say,	 “I	 guess	 you	 guys	 are	 deaf.	 I’m	 not	 proceeding	 until	 I	 get	 a	 hearing.	 I

insist	on	getting	this	into	the	record.”
Kaufman	 looks	 at	 Huver	 and	 both	 seem	 to	 lose	 air.	 They	 know	 I’m	 crazy
enough	 to	 go	 on	 strike,	 refuse	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 trial,	 and	 when	 that	 happens
they	 are	 staring	 at	 a	 mistrial.	 The	 judge	 glares	 at	 me	 and	 says,	 “I	 hold	 you	 in
contempt.”
“Put	me	in	jail,”	I	say,	mocking,	taunting.	The	court	reporter	is	getting	every
word.	“Put	me	in	jail.”
But	 he	 can’t	 do	 it	 right	 now.	 He	 has	 to	 make	 a	 decision,	 and	 a	 wrong	 one
could	jeopardize	everything.	If	I	go	to	jail	over	this,	the	entire	trial	is	hijacked	and
there’s	 really	 no	 way	 to	 save	 it.	 Somewhere	 down	 the	 road,	 an	 appellate	 court,
most	likely	a	federal	one,	will	review	Kaufman’s	exact	movements	right	here	and
call	a	foul.	Gardy	has	to	have	a	lawyer,	a	real	one,	and	they	simply	cannot	proceed
with	me	in	jail.	They’ve	handed	me	a	gift.
A	few	seconds	pass	and	tempers	cool.	Helpfully,	almost	sweetly,	I	say,	“Look,
Judge,	 you	 can’t	 deny	 me	 a	 hearing	 on	 this.	 To	 do	 so	 is	 to	 hand	 me	 some	 heavy
ammo	for	the	appeal.”
“What	kind	of	hearing?”	he	says,	cracking.
“I	 want	 this	 woman,	 this	 Marlo	 Wilfang,	 on	 the	 witness	 stand	 in	 a	 closed
hearing.	You	guys	are	hell-bent	on	nailing	me	with	improper	contact,	so	let’s	get	to
the	bottom	of	it.	I	have	the	right	to	defend	myself.	Send	the	jury	home	for	the	day
and	let’s	have	us	a	brawl.”
“I’m	not	sending	the	jury	home,”	he	says	as	he	falls	into	his	chair,	defeated.
“Fine.	Keep	’em	locked	up	all	day.	I	don’t	care.	This	gal	has	lied	to	you,	and	in
doing	 so	 she’s	 stuck	 her	 nose	 into	 the	 middle	 of	 this	 trial.	 There’s	 no	 way	 her
mother	can	stay	on	the	jury.	It’s	grounds	for	a	mistrial	now,	and	it’s	damned	sure
grounds	for	a	reversal	five	years	from	now.	Pick	your	poison.”
They	 are	 listening	 because	 they	 are	 suddenly	 frightened	 and	 woefully
inexperienced.	 I’ve	 gotten	 the	 mistrials.	 I’ve	 gotten	 the	 reversals.	 I’ve	 been	 here
many	times,	in	the	center	of	the	arena	where	death	is	on	the	line	and	one	mistake
can	ruin	a	case.	They	are	novices.	Kaufman	has	presided	over	two	capital	murder
trials	in	the	seven	years	he’s	been	on	the	bench.	Huver	has	sent	only	one	man	to
death	row,	an	embarrassment	for	any	prosecutor	around	here.	Two	years	ago	he
bungled	 a	 death	 case	 so	 badly	 the	 judge	 (not	 Kaufman)	 was	 forced	 to	 declare	 a
mistrial.	The	charges	were	later	dismissed.	They	are	in	over	their	heads	and	they
have	just	blundered	badly.
“Who	prepared	the	affidavit?”	I	ask.
No	response.
I	 say,	 “Look,	 the	 language	 used	 here	 definitely	 came	 from	 a	 lawyer.	 No
layperson	speaks	like	this.	Did	your	office	prepare	it,	Huver?”

Huver,	 trying	 to	 remain	 cool	 but	 now	 far	 beyond	 desperate,	 says	 something
that	not	even	Kaufman	can	believe:	“Judge,	we	can	continue	with	Trots	while	Mr.
Rudd	sits	over	in	the	jail.”
I	burst	out	laughing	as	Kaufman	looks	like	he’s	been	slapped.
“Oh,	go	right	ahead,”	I	say,	taunting.	“You’ve	managed	to	botch	this	case	from
the	first	day,	just	go	ahead	and	award	Gardy	with	a	reversal.”
Kaufman	says,	“No.	Mr.	Trots	has	said	nothing	so	far	and	it	would	be	wise	if
that	boy	just	continues	sitting	there	with	that	stupid	look	on	his	face.”	While	this	is
funny,	 I	 look	 hard	 at	 His	 Honor	 and	 then	 hard	 at	 the	 court	 reporter,	 who’s
capturing	it	all.
“Strike	that,”	Kaufman	barks	at	her	as	he	catches	himself.	What	a	moron.	A
trial	often	resembles	a	bad	circus	as	various	acts	spin	out	of	control.	What	began
as	a	fun-and-games	attempt	to	humiliate	me	now	looks	like	a	terrible	idea,	at	least
for	them.
I	don’t	want	Huver	coming	up	with	any	good	ideas—not	that	I	have	much	to
worry	 about—and	 so	 to	 keep	 him	 off	 balance	 I	 throw	 some	 gas	 on	 the	 fire	 by
saying,	“Of	all	the	stupid	things	you’ve	said	so	far	in	this	trial,	that	has	got	to	be
the	winner.	Bennie	Trots.	What	a	joke.	You	would	want	him	in	the	first	chair.”
“What’s	your	position,	Mr.	Rudd?”	Kaufman	demands.
“I’m	 not	 walking	 back	 into	 that	 courtroom	 until	 we	 have	 a	 hearing	 on
improper	contact	with	juror	number	eight,	the	lovely	Mrs.	Glynna	Roston.	If	I’m
really	in	contempt,	then	throw	me	in	jail.	Right	now	I’d	rather	have	a	mistrial	than
a	triple	orgasm.”
“No	need	to	be	crude,	Mr.	Rudd.”
Huver	 begins	 fidgeting	 and	 stammering.	 “Well,	 uh,	 Judge,	 uh,	 I	 suppose	 we
could	deal	with	the	improper	contact	and	the	contempt	later,	you	know,	after	the
trial	 or	 something.	 Me,	 I’d	 just	 rather	 get	 on	 with	 the	 testimony.	 This,	 uh,	 just
seems	so	unnecessary	at	this	point.”
“Then	why’d	you	start	it,	Huver?”	I	say.	“Why	did	you	clowns	get	all	excited
about	 improper	 contact	 when	 you	 knew	 damned	 well	 this	 Wilfang	 woman	 is
lying?”
“Don’t	call	me	a	clown,”	Judge	Kaufman	sneers.
“Sorry,	Judge,	I	wasn’t	referring	to	you.	I	was	referring	to	all	the	clowns	in	the
prosecutor’s	office,	including	the	district	attorney	himself.”
“If	we	could	elevate	the	level	of	discourse	here,”	Kaufman	says.
“My	apologies,”	I	say,	about	as	sarcastically	as	humanly	possible.
Huver	 retreats	 to	 the	 window,	 where	 he	 stares	 onto	 the	 rows	 of	 shabby
buildings	that	comprise	the	Main	Street	of	Milo.	Kaufman	retreats	to	a	bookcase

behind	 his	 desk	 where	 he	 stares	 at	 books	 he’s	 never	 touched.	 The	 air	 is	 strained
and	tense.	A	weighty	decision	must	be	made,	and	quickly,	and	if	His	Honor	gets	it
wrong	the	aftershocks	will	ripple	for	years.
He	finally	turns	around	and	says,	“I	guess	we’d	better	question	juror	number
eight,	but	we’re	not	doing	it	out	there.	We’ll	conduct	the	inquiry	here.”
What	follows	is	one	of	those	episodes	in	a	trial	that	frustrate	litigants,	jurors,
and	observers.	We	spend	the	rest	of	the	day	in	Judge	Kaufman’s	less	than	spacious
chambers	haggling	and	often	yelling	over	the	ins	and	outs	of	my	improper	contact
with	 a	 juror.	 Glynna	 Roston	 is	 dragged	 in,	 put	 under	 oath,	 and	 is	 almost	 too
terrified	 to	 speak.	 She	 begins	 lying	 immediately	 when	 she	 says	 she	 has	 not
discussed	 this	 case	 with	 her	 family.	 On	 cross-examination,	 I	 attack	 with	 a
vengeance	that	seems	to	astonish	even	Kaufman	and	Huver.	She	leaves	the	room
sobbing.	 Next,	 they	 drag	 in	 her	 daffy	 daughter,	 Ms.	 Marlo	 Wilfang,	 who	 repeats
her	little	narrative	under	the	clumsy	questioning	of	Dan	Huver,	who’s	really	off	his
game	 now.	 When	 she’s	 handed	 over	 to	 me,	 I	 sweetly	 walk	 her	 down	 the	 golden
path,	 then	 slice	 her	 throat	 from	 ear	 to	 ear.	 Within	 ten	 minutes,	 she’s	 crying,
gasping	for	breath,	and	wishing	a	thousand	times	she’d	never	called	my	name	at
the	 arena.	 It	 becomes	 painfully	 obvious	 she’s	 lying	 in	 her	 affidavit.	 Even	 Judge
Kaufman	 asks	 her,	 “In	 a	 crowd	 of	 five	 thousand	 people,	 how	 did	 Mr.	 Rudd	 find
you	if	he’s	never	met	you	before?”
Thank	you,	Judge.	That	would	be	the	great	question.
As	 her	 story	 goes,	 she	 came	 home	 from	 the	 fights	 late	 on	 Friday.	 When	 she
finally	 woke	 up	 on	 Saturday,	 she	 called	 her	 mother,	 who	 immediately	 called	 Mr.
Dan	 Huver,	 who	 knew	 exactly	 what	 to	 do.	 They	 met	 in	 his	 office	 on	 Sunday
afternoon,	 worked	 out	 the	 language	 for	 the	 affidavit,	 and,	 presto!	 Huver	 was	 in
business.
I	call	Huver	as	a	witness.	He	objects.	We	argue,	but	Kaufman	has	no	choice.	I
question	 Huver	 for	 an	 hour,	 and	 two	 bobcats	 trapped	 in	 the	 same	 burlap	 sack
would	 be	 much	 more	 civilized.	 One	 of	 his	 assistants	 wrote	 every	 word	 of	 the
affidavit.	One	of	his	secretaries	typed	it.	Another	secretary	notarized	it.
He	then	questions	me	and	the	squabbling	continues.	Throughout	this	tedious
ordeal,	 the	 jurors	 wait	 in	 the	 deliberation	 room,	 no	 doubt	 briefed	 by	 Glynna
Roston	and	no	doubt	blaming	me	for	another	frustrating	delay	in	the	trial.	As	if	I
care.	 I	 keep	 reminding	 Kaufman	 and	 Huver	 that	 they	 are	 playing	 with	 a	 cobra
here.	If	Glynna	Roston	stays	on	the	jury,	I’m	guaranteed	a	reversal.	I’m	not	sure	of
this—on	appeal	nothing	is	guaranteed—but	I	gradually	see	them	wither	under	the
strain	 and	 doubt	 their	 own	 judgment.	 I	 repeatedly	 move	 for	 a	 mistrial.	 The
motions	 are	 repeatedly	 denied.	 I	 don’t	 care.	 It’s	 in	 the	 record.	 Late	 in	 the
afternoon,	 Kaufman	 decides	 to	 excuse	 Mrs.	 Roston	 and	 replace	 her	 with	 Ms.
Mazy,	one	of	our	blue-ribbon	alternates.
Ms.	Mazy	is	no	replacement	to	get	excited	about;	in	fact,	she’s	no	better	than

the	last	old	gal	who	occupied	her	chair.	No	one	in	Milo	would	be	better.	You	could
select	 twelve	 from	 a	 pool	 of	 a	 thousand	 and	 every	 jury	 would	 look	 and	 vote	 the
same.	So	why	did	I	burn	so	much	clock	today?	To	hold	them	accountable.	To	scare
the	 hell	 out	 of	 them	 with	 the	 scenario	 that	 they—prosecutor	 and	 judge,	 duly
elected	 by	 the	 locals—could	 screw	 up	 the	 most	 sensational	 case	 this	 backwater
hick	town	has	ever	seen.	To	collect	ammunition	for	the	appeal.	And,	to	make	them
respect	me.
I	demand	that	Marlo	Wilfang	be	prosecuted	for	perjury,	but	the	prosecutor	is
tired.	 I	 demand	 she	 be	 held	 in	 contempt.	 Instead,	 Judge	 Kaufman	 reminds	 me
that	I’m	in	contempt.	He	sends	for	a	bailiff,	one	with	handcuffs.
I	say,	“I’m	sorry,	Judge,	but	I’ve	forgotten	why	you	found	me	in	contempt.	It
was	so	long	ago.”
“Because	 you	 refused	 to	 continue	 the	 trial	 this	 morning,	 and	 because	 we’ve
wasted	an	entire	day	back	here	fighting	over	a	juror.	Plus,	you	insulted	me.”
There	 are	 so	 many	 ways	 to	 respond	 to	 this	 nonsense,	 but	 I	 decide	 to	 let	 it
pass.	 Tossing	 me	 in	 jail	 over	 a	 contempt	 charge	 will	 only	 complicate	 matters	 for
them,	for	the	authorities,	and	it	will	give	me	even	more	ammo	for	Gardy’s	appeal.
A	large	deputy	comes	in	and	Kaufman	says,	“Take	him	to	jail.”
Huver	is	at	the	window,	his	back	to	it	all.
I	don’t	want	to	go	to	jail,	but	I	can’t	wait	to	get	out	of	this	room.	It’s	beginning
to	reek	of	stale	body	odor.	The	handcuffs	are	locked	around	my	wrists,	hands	in
front,	not	back,	and	as	I’m	led	away	I	look	at	Kaufman	and	say,	“I’m	assuming	I
will	be	allowed	to	continue	as	lead	counsel	in	the	morning.”
“You	will.”
To	frighten	them	even	more,	I	add,	“The	last	time	I	was	tossed	in	jail	in	the
middle	of	a	trial	the	conviction	was	reversed	by	the	state	supreme	court.	Nine	to
zero.	You	clowns	should	read	your	cases.”
Another	large	deputy	joins	our	little	parade.	They	take	me	through	the	back
doors	and	down	the	rear	hallway	I	use	every	day.	For	some	reason	we	pause	on	a
landing	as	the	deputies	mumble	into	their	radios.	When	we	finally	step	outside,	I
get	the	impression	that	word	was	leaked.	A	cheer	goes	up	by	my	haters	when	they
see	 me	 frog-marched	 out,	 handcuffed.	 For	 no	 apparent	 reason,	 the	 cops	 stall	 as
they	try	to	decide	which	patrol	car	to	use.	I	stand	by	one,	exposed,	smiling	at	my
little	 mob.	 I	 see	 Partner	 and	 yell	 that	 I’ll	 call	 him	 later.	 He	 is	 stunned	 and
confused.	For	sport,	they	shove	me	into	the	same	backseat	with	Gardy;	lawyer	and
client,	off	to	jail.	As	we	pull	away,	with	lights	and	sirens	fully	engaged	to	give	this
miserable	town	as	much	drama	as	possible,	Gardy	looks	at	me	and	says,	“Where
you	been	all	day?”
I’m	not	about	to	try.	I	lift	my	bound	hands	and	say,	“Fighting	with	the	judge.
Guess	who	won?”

“How	can	they	throw	a	lawyer	in	jail?”
“The	judge	can	do	whatever	he	wants.”
“You	getting	the	death	penalty	too?”
I	chuckle	for	the	first	time	in	many	hours.	“No,	not	yet	anyway.”
Gardy	 is	 amused	 by	 this	 unexpected	 change	 in	 routine.	 He	 says,	 “You’re
gonna	love	the	food	there.”
“I’ll	 bet.”	 The	 two	 deputies	 in	 the	 front	 seat	 are	 listening	 so	 hard	 they’re
barely	breathing.
“You	ever	been	in	jail	before?”	my	client	asks.
“Oh	yes,	several	times.	I	have	a	knack	for	pissing	off	judges.”
“How’d	you	piss	off	Judge	Kaufman?”
“It’s	a	long	story.”
“Well,	we	got	all	night,	don’t	we?”
I	 suppose	 we	 do,	 though	 I	 doubt	 they’ll	 throw	 me	 in	 the	 same	 cell	 with	 my
dear	 client.	 Minutes	 later	 we	 stop	 in	 front	 of	 a	 1950s-style	 flat-roofed	 building
with	several	additions	stuck	to	its	sides	like	malignant	tumors.	I’ve	been	here	a	few
times	to	meet	with	Gardy	and	it’s	a	miserable	place.	We	park;	they	yank	us	out	of
the	car	and	jostle	us	inside	a	cramped	open	room	where	some	cops	lounge	around
pushing	paper	and	acting	like	badasses.	Gardy	disappears	into	the	rear,	and	when
an	unseen	door	opens	I	can	hear	prisoners	yelling	in	the	background.
“Judge	Kaufman	said	I	can	make	two	phone	calls,”	I	snap	at	the	jailer	as	he
moves	toward	me.	He	stops,	uncertain	as	to	what	exactly	a	jailer	is	supposed	to	do
when	confronting	an	angry	lawyer	sent	over	for	contempt.	He	backs	away.
I	 call	 Judith,	 and	 after	 barking	 at	 her	 receptionist,	 then	 her	 secretary,	 then
her	paralegal,	I	get	her	on	the	phone,	explain	I’m	in	jail	again	and	need	help.	She
curses,	reminds	me	of	how	busy	she	is,	then	says	all	right.	I	call	Partner	and	give
him	the	update.
They	 hand	 me	 an	 orange	 jumpsuit	 with	 “Milo	 City	 Jail”	 stenciled	 across	 the
back.	I	change	in	a	filthy	bathroom,	carefully	arranging	my	shirt,	tie,	and	suit	on
one	 hanger.	 I	 hand	 it	 to	 the	 jailer	 and	 say,	 “Please	 don’t	 wrinkle	 this.	 I	 have	 to
wear	it	tomorrow.”
“You	 want	 it	 pressed?”	 he	 says,	 then	 roars	 with	 laughter.	 The	 others	 break
down	 too	 at	 this	 real	 knee-slapper,	 and	 I	 smile	 like	 a	 good	 sport.	 When	 the
laughing	is	over	I	say,	“So	what’s	for	dinner?”
The	jailer	says,	“It’s	Monday,	Spam	day.	Always	Spam	on	Monday.”
“Can’t	wait.”	My	cell	is	a	ten-by-ten	concrete	bunker	that	reeks	of	stale	urine
and	body	odor.	On	the	bunk	beds	are	two	young	black	men,	one	reading,	the	other

napping.	 There	 is	 no	 third	 bed,	 so	 I’ll	 sleep	 in	 a	 plastic	 chair	 stained	 with	 dark
brown	 splotches.	 My	 two	 new	 cellies	 do	 not	 appear	 the	 least	 bit	 friendly.	 I	 don’t
want	to	fight,	but	getting	beat	up	in	jail,	in	the	middle	of	a	capital	murder	defense,
would	cause	an	automatic	mistrial.	I’ll	ponder	it.
Because	she’s	done	this	before,	Judith	knows	exactly	what	to	do.	At	5:00	p.m.,
she	 files	 a	 petition	 for	 habeas	 corpus	 in	 federal	 court	 in	 the	 City,	 with	 an	 urgent
demand	for	an	immediate	hearing.	I	love	federal	court,	most	of	the	time.
She	also	sends	a	copy	of	her	petition	to	my	favorite	reporter	at	the	newspaper.
I’ll	 make	 as	 much	 noise	 as	 possible.	 Kaufman	 and	 Huver	 have	 blundered	 badly,
and	they’ll	pay	for	it.	The	reader	on	the	bottom	bunk	decides	he	wants	to	talk,	so	I
explain	why	I’m	here.	He	thinks	it’s	funny,	a	lawyer	in	jail	for	pissing	off	the	judge.
The	napper	on	the	top	bunk	rolls	over	and	joins	the	fun.	Before	long,	I’m	giving
legal	advice,	and	these	guys	need	as	much	as	I	can	dish	out.
An	hour	later,	a	jailer	fetches	me	with	the	news	that	I	have	a	visitor.	I	follow
him	through	a	maze	of	narrow	hallways	and	find	myself	in	a	cramped	room	with	a
Breathalyzer.	This	is	where	they	bring	the	drunk	drivers.	The	Bishop	stands	and
we	 shake	 hands.	 We’ve	 spoken	 on	 the	 phone	 but	 never	 met.	 I	 thank	 him	 for
coming	 but	 caution	 him	 about	 doing	 so.	 He	 says	 screw	 it—he’s	 not	 afraid	 of	 the
locals.	Plus,	he	knows	how	to	lie	low	and	stay	under	the	radar.	He	also	knows	the
police	chief,	the	cops,	the	judge—the	usual	small-town	crap.	He	says	he’s	tried	to
call	Huver	and	Kaufman	to	tell	them	they’ve	made	a	big	mistake,	but	he	can’t	get
through.	He’s	leaning	on	the	police	chief	to	put	me	in	a	better	cell.	The	more	we
talk,	 the	 more	 I	 like	 the	 guy.	 He’s	 a	 street	 fighter,	 a	 worn-out,	 frazzled	 old	 goat
who’s	been	knocking	heads	with	the	cops	for	decades.	He	hasn’t	made	a	dime	and
doesn’t	care.	I	wonder	if	I’ll	be	him	in	twenty	years.
“How	about	the	DNA	tests?”	he	asks.
“The	 lab	 will	 get	 the	 samples	 tomorrow	 and	 they’ve	 promised	 a	 quick
turnaround.”
“And	if	it’s	Peeley?”
“All	hell	breaks	loose.”	This	guy	is	on	my	side,	but	I	don’t	know	him.	We	chat
for	ten	minutes	and	he	says	good-bye.
When	 I	 return	 to	 my	 cell,	 my	 two	 new	 friends	 have	 spread	 the	 word	 that
there’s	a	criminal	lawyer	in	here	with	them.	Before	long,	I’m	yelling	advice	up	and
down	the	block.

11.
Common	sense	is	not	always	my	strong	suit,	but	I	decide	not	to	start	a	fight
with	Fonzo	and	Frog,	my	two	new	partners	in	crime.	Instead	I	sit	in	my	chair	all
night	and	try	to	nap.	It	doesn’t	work.	I	said	no	to	the	Spam	for	dinner	and	no	to
the	 putrid	 eggs	 and	 cold	 toast	 for	 breakfast.	 Thankfully,	 no	 one	 mentions	 a
shower.	They	bring	me	my	suit,	shirt,	tie,	shoes,	and	socks,	and	I	dress	quickly.	I
say	 good-bye	 to	 my	 cellies,	 both	 of	 whom	 will	 be	 behind	 bars	 for	 several	 years,
regardless	of	the	brilliant	advice	I	dispensed	for	hours.
Gardy	and	I	are	given	separate	rides	back	to	the	courthouse.	A	larger	crowd	of
enemies	jeer	at	me	as	I’m	sort	of	dragged	out	of	the	car,	still	in	handcuffs.	Once
I’m	inside	and	away	from	any	photographers,	they	remove	the	handcuffs.	Partner
is	waiting	in	the	hallway.	I	made	the	morning	edition	of	the	Chronicle,	the	City’s
daily.	Metro	section,	third	page.	No	big	deal—Rudd	is	thrown	in	jail	again.
As	 instructed,	 I	 follow	 a	 bailiff	 back	 into	 the	 chambers	 of	 Judge	 Kaufman,
who’s	waiting	with	Huver.	Both	wear	smirks	and	are	curious	to	see	how	I	survived
the	night.	I	do	not	mention	the	jail,	do	not	acknowledge	the	fact	that	I’ve	not	slept,
eaten,	or	showered	in	a	long	time.	I’m	in	one	piece,	raring	to	go,	and	this	seems	to
irritate	them.	It’s	all	fun	and	games,	with	Gardy’s	life	on	the	line.
Seconds	after	I	step	into	chambers,	another	bailiff	rushes	in	and	says,	“Sorry,
Judge,	but	there’s	a	U.S.	marshal	out	here	says	you	gotta	be	in	federal	court	in	the
City	at	eleven	this	morning.	You	too,	Mr.	Huver.”
“What	the	hell?”	Kaufman	says.
Oh	 so	 helpfully,	 I	 explain,	 “It’s	 a	 habeas	 corpus	 hearing,	 Judge.	 My	 lawyers
filed	it	yesterday	afternoon.	An	emergency	hearing	to	get	me	out	of	jail.	You	guys
started	this	crap,	now	I	have	to	finish	it.”
“Does	 he	 have	 a	 subpoena?”	 Huver	 asks.	 The	 bailiff	 hands	 over	 some
paperwork	and	Huver	and	Kaufman	scan	it	quickly.
“It’s	not	a	subpoena,”	Kaufman	says.	“It’s	sort	of	a	notice	from	Judge	Samson.
Thought	he	was	dead.	He	has	no	right	to	notify	me	to	be	present	for	a	hearing	of
any	kind.”
“He’s	been	off	his	rocker	for	twenty	years,”	Huver	says,	somewhat	relieved.	“I
ain’t	going.	We’re	in	the	middle	of	a	trial	here.”
He’s	not	wrong	about	Judge	Samson.	If	the	lawyers	could	vote	for	the	craziest
federal	 judge	 in	 the	 land,	 Arnie	 Samson	 would	 win	 in	 a	 landslide.	 But	 he’s	 my
crazy	friend,	and	he’s	freed	me	from	jail	before.
Kaufman	says	to	the	bailiff,	“Tell	the	marshal	to	get	lost.	If	he	starts	trouble,
tell	 the	 sheriff	 to	 arrest	 him.	 That’ll	 really	 piss	 him	 off,	 won’t	 it?	 The	 sheriff

arresting	 a	 marshal.	 Ha.	 Bet	 that’s	 never	 happened	 before.	 Anyway,	 we’re	 not
leaving.	We	have	a	trial	to	resume	here.”
“Why’d	you	run	to	federal	court?”	Huver	asks	me	in	all	seriousness.
“Because	I	don’t	like	being	in	jail.	What	kinda	stupid	question	is	that?”
The	bailiff	leaves	and	Kaufman	says,	“I’m	vacating	the	contempt	order,	okay,
Mr.	Rudd?	I	figure	one	night	in	the	slammer	is	enough	for	your	behavior.”
I	say,	“Well,	it’s	certainly	enough	for	a	mistrial	or	a	reversal.”
“Let’s	not	argue	that,”	Kaufman	says.	“Can	we	proceed?”
“You’re	the	judge.”
“What	about	the	hearing	in	federal	court?”
“Are	you	asking	me	for	legal	advice?”	I	fire	back.
“Hell	no.”
“Ignore	the	notice	at	your	own	risk.	Hell,	Judge	Samson	might	throw	the	both
of	you	in	jail	for	a	night	or	two.	Wouldn’t	that	be	funny?”

12.
We	 eventually	 make	 it	 back	 to	 the	 courtroom,	 and	 it	 takes	 some	 time	 to	 get
everyone	 settled.	 When	 the	 jury	 is	 brought	 in,	 I	 refuse	 to	 look	 at	 them.	 By	 now
they	 all	 know	 I	 spent	 the	 night	 in	 jail,	 and	 I’m	 sure	 they’re	 curious	 about	 how	 I
survived.	So	I	give	them	nothing.
Judge	Kaufman	apologizes	for	the	delays	and	says	it’s	time	to	get	to	work.	He
looks	at	Huver,	who	stands	and	says,	“Your	Honor,	the	State	rests.”
This	is	an	amateurish	ploy	designed	to	make	my	life	even	more	miserable.	I
rise	and	angrily	say,	“Your	Honor,	he	could’ve	told	me	this	yesterday	or	even	this
morning.”
“Call	your	first	witness,”	Kaufman	barks.
“I’m	not	ready.	I	have	some	motions.	On	the	record.”
He	 has	 no	 choice	 but	 to	 excuse	 the	 jury.	 We	 spend	 the	 next	 two	 hours
haggling	over	whether	or	not	the	State	has	presented	enough	proof	to	keep	going.
I	 repeat	 the	 same	 arguments.	 Kaufman	 makes	 the	 same	 rulings.	 It’s	 all	 for	 the
record.
My	 first	 witness	 is	 a	 scraggly,	 troubled	 kid	 who	 looks	 remarkably	 similar	 to
my	client.	His	first	name	is	Wilson;	he’s	fifteen	years	old,	a	dropout,	a	druggie,	a
kid	 who’s	 basically	 homeless,	 though	 an	 aunt	 allows	 him	 to	 sleep	 in	 the	 garage
whenever	he’s	sick.	And	he’s	our	star	witness!
The	 Fentress	 girls	 went	 missing	 around	 4:00	 on	 a	 Wednesday	 afternoon.
They	 left	 school	 on	 their	 bikes	 but	 never	 made	 it	 home.	 A	 search	 began	 around
6:00	 and	 intensified	 as	 the	 hours	 passed.	 By	 midnight,	 the	 entire	 town	 was	 in	 a
panic	and	everyone	was	outside	with	a	flashlight.	Their	bodies	were	found	in	the
polluted	pond	around	noon	the	following	day.
I	 have	 six	 witnesses,	 Wilson	 and	 five	 others,	 who	 will	 testify	 that	 they	 were
with	Gardy	on	that	Wednesday	afternoon	from	around	2:00	until	dark.	They	were
at	 a	 place	 called	 the	 Pit,	 an	 abandoned	 gravel	 pit	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 some	 dense
woods	south	of	town.	It’s	a	secluded	hideout	for	truants,	runaways,	homeless	kids,
druggies,	 petty	 felons,	 and	 drunks.	 It	 attracts	 a	 few	 older	 deadbeats,	 but	 for	 the
most	part	it’s	a	haven	for	the	kids	nobody	wants.	They	sleep	under	lean-tos,	share
their	stolen	food,	drink	their	stolen	booze,	take	drugs	I’ve	never	heard	of,	engage
in	 random	 sex,	 and	 in	 general	 waste	 away	 the	 days	 while	 sliding	 closer	 to	 either
death	 or	 incarceration.	 Gardy	 was	 there	 when	 someone	 else	 abducted	 and
murdered	the	Fentress	girls.
So	we	have	an	alibi—my	client’s	whereabouts	can	be	vouched	for.	Or	can	it?
By	the	time	Wilson	takes	the	stand	and	is	sworn	in,	the	jurors	are	suspicious.

For	 the	 occasion	 he’s	 wearing	 what	 he	 always	 wears—grimy	 jeans	 with	 lots	 of
holes,	 battered	 combat	 boots,	 a	 green	 T-shirt	 proclaiming	 the	 greatness	 of	 some
acid-rock	band,	and	a	smart	purple	bandanna	looped	around	his	neck.	His	scalp	is
skinned	 above	 the	 ears	 and	 yields	 to	 a	 bright	 orange	 Mohawk	 roaring	 down	 the
center.	He’s	displaying	the	obligatory	collection	of	tattoos,	earrings,	and	piercings.
Because	he’s	just	a	kid	without	a	clue	and	is	now	being	dragged	into	such	a	formal
setting,	he	instantly	retreats	behind	a	smirk	that	makes	you	want	to	slap	him.
“Just	be	normal,”	I	told	him.	Sadly,	he	is.	I	wouldn’t	believe	a	word	he	says,
though	 he’s	 telling	 the	 truth.	 As	 rehearsed,	 we	 walk	 through	 that	 Wednesday
afternoon.
Huver	 annihilates	 him	 on	 cross-examination.	 You’re	 fifteen	 years	 old,	 son,
why	were	you	not	in	school?	Smoking	dope,	huh,	along	with	your	pal	here,	that’s
what	 you’re	 telling	 these	 jurors?	 Drinking,	 and	 drugging,	 just	 a	 bunch	 of
deadbeats,	right?	Wilson	does	a	lousy	job	of	denying	this.	After	fifteen	minutes	of
abuse,	Wilson	is	disoriented,	afraid	he	might	be	charged	with	some	crime.	Huver
hammers	away,	a	bully	on	the	playground.
But	because	Huver	is	not	too	bright,	he	goes	too	far.	He’s	got	Wilson	on	the
ropes	 and	 is	 drawing	 blood	 with	 each	 question.	 He’s	 grilling	 him	 about	 dates—
how	 can	 he	 be	 certain	 it	 was	 that	 Wednesday	 back	 in	 March?	 You	 kids	 keep	 a
calendar	out	there	at	the	Pit?
Loudly,	“You	have	no	idea	what	Wednesday	you’re	talking	about,	do	you?”
“Yes,	sir,”	Wilson	says,	politely	for	the	first	time.
“How?”
“Because	the	police	came	out	there,	said	they	were	looking	for	two	little	girls.
That	 was	 the	 day.	 And	 Gardy	 had	 been	 there	 all	 afternoon.”	 For	 a	 kid	 without	 a
brain,	Wilson	delivers	this	perfectly,	just	like	we	practiced.
Evidently,	when	there	is	a	crime	in	Milo	slightly	more	serious	than	littering,
the	police	rush	out	to	the	Pit	and	make	accusations.	Harass	the	usual	suspects.	It’s
about	three	miles	from	the	pond	where	the	Fentress	girls	were	found.	It’s	blatantly
obvious	 none	 of	 the	 regulars	 at	 the	 Pit	 have	 any	 means	 of	 transportation	 other
than	 their	 feet,	 yet	 the	 police	 routinely	 show	 up	 and	 throw	 around	 their
considerable	weight.	Gardy	says	he	remembers	the	cops	asking	about	the	missing
girls.	The	cops,	of	course,	do	not	remember	seeing	Gardy	at	the	Pit.
None	of	this	matters.	This	jury	is	not	about	to	believe	a	word	Wilson	says.
Next,	 I	 call	 a	 witness	 with	 even	 less	 credibility.	 They	 call	 her	 Lolo,	 and	 the
poor	 child	 has	 lived	 under	 bridges	 and	 in	 box	 culverts	 for	 as	 long	 as	 she	 can
remember.	The	boys	protect	her	and	in	return	she	keeps	them	satisfied.	She’s	now
nineteen	and	there’s	no	way	she	will	see	twenty-five,	not	on	this	side	of	the	bars.
She’s	 covered	 in	 tattoos,	 and	 by	 the	 time	 she’s	 sworn	 in	 the	 jurors	 are	 already
disgusted.	 She	 remembers	 that	 particular	 Wednesday,	 remembers	 the	 cops

coming	out	to	the	Pit,	remembers	Gardy	being	there	all	afternoon.
On	cross,	Huver	can’t	wait	to	bring	up	the	fact	that	she’s	been	busted	twice	for
shoplifting.	 For	 food!	 What	 are	 you	 supposed	 to	 do	 when	 you’re	 hungry?	 Huver
makes	this	sound	like	she	deserves	the	death	penalty.
We	plow	ahead.	I	call	my	alibi	witnesses,	who	tell	the	truth,	and	Huver	makes
them	look	like	criminals.	Such	is	the	lunacy	and	unfairness	of	the	system.	Huver’s
witnesses,	the	ones	testifying	on	behalf	of	the	State,	are	cloaked	with	legitimacy,	as
if	 they’ve	 been	 sanctified	 by	 the	 authorities.	 Cops,	 experts,	 even	 snitches	 who’ve
been	washed	and	cleansed	and	spruced	up	in	nice	clothes,	all	take	the	stand	and
tell	lies	in	a	coordinated	effort	to	have	my	client	executed.	But	the	witnesses	who
know	 the	 truth,	 and	 are	 telling	 it,	 are	 discounted	 immediately	 and	 made	 to	 look
like	fools.
Like	so	many,	this	trial	is	not	about	the	truth;	it’s	about	winning.	And	to	win,
with	 no	 real	 evidence,	 Huver	 must	 fabricate	 and	 lie	 and	 attack	 the	 truth	 as	 if	 he
hates	it.	I	have	six	witnesses	who	swear	my	client	was	nowhere	close	to	the	scene
when	 the	 crime	 was	 committed,	 and	 all	 six	 are	 scoffed	 at.	 Huver	 has	 produced
almost	 two	 dozen	 witnesses,	 virtually	 all	 known	 to	 be	 liars	 by	 the	 cops,	 the
prosecution,	 and	 the	 judge,	 yet	 the	 jurors	 lap	 up	 their	 lies	 as	 if	 they’re	 reading
Holy	Scripture.

13.
I	 show	 the	 jurors	 a	 map	 of	 their	 lovely	 town.	 The	 Pit	 is	 far	 away	 from	 the
pond;	 there’s	 no	 possible	 way	 Gardy	 could	 have	 been	 in	 both	 places	 at	 the
approximate	 time	 the	 girls	 were	 murdered.	 The	 jurors	 don’t	 believe	 any	 of	 this
because	they	have	known	for	some	time	that	Gardy	was	a	member	of	a	satanic	cult
with	 a	 history	 of	 sexual	 perversion.	 There	 is	 no	 physical	 proof	 that	 the	 Fentress
girls	 were	 sexually	 assaulted;	 yet	 every	 miserable	 redneck	 in	 this	 awful	 place
believes	Gardy	raped	them	before	he	killed	them.
At	midnight,	I’m	lying	across	my	lumpy	motel	bed,	9-millimeter	by	my	side,
when	 my	 cell	 phone	 beeps.	 It’s	 the	 DNA	 lab	 in	 San	 Diego.	 The	 blood	 Tadeo
brutally	extracted	from	the	forehead	of	Jack	Peeley	matches	the	strand	of	hair	the
murderer	left	behind	in	the	shoelaces	he	tightly	bound	around	the	ankles	of	Jenna
Fentress,	age	eleven.

14.
Sleep	is	impossible;	I	can’t	even	close	my	eyes.	Partner	and	I	leave	the	motel
in	the	dark	and	are	almost	to	Milo	before	we	see	the	first	hint	of	light	in	the	east.	I
meet	with	the	Bishop	in	his	office	as	the	town	slowly	comes	to	life.	He	calls	Judge
Kaufman	 at	 home,	 gets	 him	 up	 and	 out	 of	 bed,	 and	 at	 8:00	 a.m.	 I’m	 in	 his
chambers	 with	 Huver	 and	 the	 court	 reporter.	 All	 of	 what	 follows	 will	 be	 on	 the
record.
I	lay	out	my	options.	If	they	refuse	to	stop	the	trial,	dismiss	the	case,	and	send
everybody	home—and	this	is	what	I	expect	them	to	do—then	I	will	either	(1)	issue
a	subpoena	for	Jack	Peeley,	have	him	hauled	into	court,	put	him	on	the	stand,	and
expose	him	as	the	killer;	or	(2)	go	to	the	press	with	the	details	of	the	DNA	testing;
or	 (3)	 announce	 to	 the	 jury	 what	 I	 know;	 or	 (4)	 do	 all	 of	 the	 above;	 or	 (5)	 do
nothing,	let	them	get	their	conviction,	and	slaughter	them	on	appeal.
They	demand	to	know	how	I	obtained	a	blood	sample	for	Jack	Peeley,	but	I’m
not	required	to	tell	them.	I	remind	them	that	for	the	past	ten	months	I’ve	begged
them	to	investigate	Peeley,	to	get	a	blood	sample,	and	so	on,	but	they	have	had	no
interest.	They	had	Gardy,	one	of	Satan’s	foot	soldiers.	For	the	tenth	time	I	explain
that	Peeley	(1)	knew	the	girls,	(2)	was	seen	near	the	pond	when	they	disappeared,
and	(3)	had	just	broken	up	with	their	mother	after	a	long,	violent	romance.
They	are	bewildered,	stunned,	at	times	almost	incoherent	as	reality	settles	in.
Their	 bogus	 and	 corrupt	 prosecution	 has	 just	 unraveled.	 They	 have	 the	 wrong
man!
Virtually	 all	 prosecutors	 have	 the	 same	 genetic	 flaw;	 they	 cannot	 admit	 the
obvious	 once	 it’s	 on	 the	 table.	 They	 cling	 to	 their	 theories.	 They	 know	 they	 are
right	because	they’ve	been	convinced	of	it	for	months,	even	years.	“I	believe	in	my
case”	is	one	of	their	favorite	lines,	and	they’ll	repeat	it	mindlessly	as	the	real	killer
walks	forward	with	blood	on	his	hands	and	says,	“I	did	it.”
Because	 I’ve	 heard	 so	 much	 of	 their	 idiotic	 bullshit	 before,	 I	 have	 tried	 to
imagine	what	Huver	might	say	at	this	point.	But	when	he	says,	“It’s	possible	Gardy
Baker	and	Jack	Peeley	were	working	together,”	I	laugh	out	loud.
Kaufman	blurts,	“Are	you	serious?”
I	say,	“Brilliant,	just	brilliant.	Two	men	who’ve	never	met,	one	eighteen	years
old,	the	other	thirty-five,	join	up	for	about	half	an	hour	to	murder	two	little	girls,
then	go	their	separate	ways,	never	to	see	each	other	again	and	both	determined	to
keep	their	mouths	shut	forever.	You	wanna	argue	that	on	appeal?”
“It	 wouldn’t	 surprise	 me,”	 Huver	 says,	 scratching	 his	 chin	 as	 if	 his	 highpowered	 brain	 is	 clicking	 right	 along	 and	 sifting	 through	 new	 theories	 of	 the
crime.

Kaufman,	whose	mouth	is	still	open	in	disbelief,	says,	“You	can’t	be	serious,
Dan.”
Dan	says,	“I	want	to	proceed.	I	think	Gardy	Baker	was	involved	in	this	crime.
I	can	get	a	conviction.”	It’s	pathetic	to	watch	him	plunge	onward	when	he	knows
he’s	wrong.
“Let	me	guess,”	I	say.	“You	believe	in	your	case.”
“Damned	right	I	do.	I	want	to	go	forward.	I	can	get	a	conviction.”
“Of	 course	 you	 can,	 and	 getting	 a	 conviction	 is	 far	 more	 important	 than
justice,”	I	say,	remarkably	under	control.	“Get	your	conviction.	We’ll	slog	through
the	appellate	courts	for	the	next	ten	years	while	Gardy	wastes	away	on	death	row
and	the	real	killer	walks	the	streets,	then	one	day	a	federal	judge	somewhere	will
see	the	light	and	we’ll	have	another	high-profile	exoneration.	You,	the	prosecutor,
and	you,	the	judge,	will	look	like	idiots	because	of	what’s	happening	right	now.”
“I	want	to	go	forward,”	Huver	says	like	a	defective	recording.
I	 keep	 going:	 “I	 think	 I’ll	 go	 to	 the	 press,	 show	 them	 the	 DNA	 test	 results.
They’ll	splash	it	around	and	you’ll	look	like	a	couple	of	clowns	still	trying	the	case.
Meanwhile,	Jack	Peeley	will	disappear.”
“How’d	you	get	his	DNA?”	Judge	Kaufman	asks	me.
“He	got	in	a	bar	fight	last	Saturday	at	the	Blue	&	White,	got	his	face	busted,
and	 the	 guy	 who	 did	 it	 works	 for	 me.	 I	 personally	 scraped	 Peeley’s	 blood	 off	 my
guy’s	fist	and	sent	it	to	the	lab,	along	with	a	sample	of	the	hair	I	collected	earlier.”
“That’s	tampering	with	the	evidence,”	Huver	says,	predictably.
“Oh,	 sue	 me,	 or	 throw	 me	 in	 jail	 again.	 This	 little	 party’s	 over,	 Dan,	 give	 it
up!”
Kaufman	says,	“I	want	to	see	the	test	results.”
“I’ll	have	them	by	tomorrow.	The	lab’s	in	San	Diego.”
“We’re	in	recess	until	then.”

15.
At	some	point	during	the	day,	the	judge	and	the	prosecutor	meet	secretly.	I’m
not	 invited.	 The	 rules	 of	 procedure	 prohibit	 such	 clandestine	 meetings,	 but	 they
happen.	 These	 guys	 need	 an	 exit	 strategy,	 and	 fast.	 By	 now	 they	 know	 I’m	 halfcrazy	 and	 I	 will	 indeed	 run	 to	 the	 press	 with	 my	 test	 results.	 At	 this	 desperate
hour,	they	are	still	more	concerned	with	politics	than	with	the	truth.	All	they	care
about	is	saving	face.
Partner	 and	 I	 return	 to	 the	 City,	 where	 I	 spend	 the	 day	 working	 on	 other
cases.	I	convince	the	lab	to	e-mail	the	test	results	to	Judge	Kaufman,	and	by	noon
he	 knows	 the	 truth.	 At	 6:00	 p.m.	 I	 get	 the	 phone	 call.	 Jack	 Peeley	 has	 just	 been
arrested.
We	 meet	 the	 following	 morning	 in	 Kaufman’s	 chambers,	 not	 in	 open	 court,
where	we	belong.	A	dismissal	in	open	court	would	be	far	too	embarrassing	for	the
system,	 so	 the	 judge	 and	 the	 prosecutor	 have	 conspired	 to	 do	 it	 behind	 closed
doors,	and	as	quickly	as	possible.	I	sit	at	a	table	with	Gardy	by	my	side	and	listen
as	 Dan	 Huver	 limps	 through	 a	 tepid	 motion	 to	 dismiss	 the	 charges.	 I	 strongly
suspect	that	Huver	wants	to	proceed	with	his	beloved	case,	the	one	he	believes	in
so	 strongly,	 but	 Kaufman	 said	 no;	 said	 this	 little	 party	 is	 over;	 said	 let’s	 cut	 our
losses	and	get	this	radical	bastard	and	his	brain-damaged	client	out	of	here.
When	the	paperwork	is	signed,	Gardy	is	a	free	man.	He’s	spent	the	last	year	in
a	tough	jail—I	should	know.	But	a	year	in	jail	for	an	innocent	man	is	pure	luck	in
our	 system.	 There	 are	 thousands	 locked	 away	 for	 decades,	 but	 that’s	 another
soapbox.
Gardy	is	bewildered,	not	sure	where	to	go	or	what	to	do.	As	they	lead	us	out	of
Kaufman’s	 chambers,	 I	 hand	 him	 two	 $20	 bills	 and	 tell	 him	 good	 luck.	 They’ll
sneak	him	back	to	the	jail	to	collect	his	assets,	and	from	there	his	mother	will	take
him	somewhere	safe.	I’ll	never	see	him	again.
He	 doesn’t	 say	 thanks	 because	 he	 doesn’t	 know	 what	 to	 say.	 I	 don’t	 want	 to
embrace	him	because	he	didn’t	shower	last	night,	but	we	manage	a	quick	hug	in	a
narrow	hallway	while	two	deputies	watch	us.	“It’s	over,	Gardy,”	I	keep	saying,	but
he	doesn’t	believe	me.
Word	 has	 leaked	 and	 there’s	 a	 mob	 waiting	 outside.	 The	 town	 of	 Milo	 will
never	 believe	 anyone	 but	 Gardy	 killed	 the	 Fentress	 girls,	 regardless	 of	 the
evidence.	This	is	what	happens	when	the	cops	act	on	one	of	their	smart	hunches
and	march	off	in	the	wrong	direction,	controlling	the	rumors	and	taking	the	press
along	 with	 them.	 The	 prosecutor	 joins	 the	 parade	 early	 on,	 and	 before	 long	 it
becomes	an	organized	and	semi-legitimate	lynching.
I	slip	through	a	side	door	to	where	Partner	is	waiting.	We	make	our	escape,

without	 an	 escort	 of	 any	 sort,	 and	 as	 we	 speed	 away	 from	 the	 courthouse	 two
tomatoes	 and	 an	 egg	 splash	 onto	 our	 windshield.	 I	 can’t	 help	 but	 laugh.	 Once
again,	I’m	leaving	town	in	style.

PART	TWO

THE	BOOM	BOOM	ROOM

1.
Rich	 people	 tend	 to	 avoid	 death	 row.	 Link	 Scanlon	 has	 not	 been	 so	 lucky,
though	you	couldn’t	find	three	people	in	this	city	who	care	about	Link	or	his	luck.
There	 are	 about	 a	 million	 people	 here,	 and	 when	 Link	 was	 finally	 convicted	 and
sent	 away,	 virtually	 everyone	 felt	 some	 measure	 of	 relief.	 Drug	 trafficking	 was
dealt	 a	 severe	 blow,	 though	 it	 soon	 recovered.	 Several	 strip	 clubs	 closed,	 which
pleased	 many	 young	 wives.	 Parents	 of	 teenage	 girls	 told	 themselves	 their
daughters	 were	 safer.	 Owners	 of	 fancy	 sports	 cars	 relaxed	 as	 auto	 thefts
plummeted.	 Most	 important,	 the	 police	 and	 narcotics	 agents	 relaxed	 and	 waited
for	the	dip	in	crime.	It	happened,	but	didn’t	last	long.
Link	was	sentenced	to	death	by	an	untampered	jury	for	killing	a	judge.	Soon
after	 he	 arrived	 on	 death	 row,	 his	 lead	 defense	 lawyer	 was	 found	 strangled.	 So	 I
suppose	the	City’s	bar	association	was	also	relieved	to	see	Link	put	away.
On	 second	 thought,	 there	 must	 have	 been	 several	 hundred	 people	 here	 who
truly	 missed	 Link,	 at	 first.	 Morticians,	 strippers,	 drug	 runners,	 chop	 shop
operators,	and	crooked	cops,	to	name	a	few.	But	it	doesn’t	matter	now.	That	was
six	 years	 ago,	 and	 once	 in	 prison	 Link	 proved	 capable	 of	 running	 most	 of	 his
businesses	from	behind	bars.
All	 he	 ever	 wanted	 was	 to	 be	 a	 gangster,	 an	 old-style	 Capone-like	 character
with	 a	 lust	 for	 blood	 and	 violence	 and	 unlimited	 cash.	 His	 father	 had	 been	 a
bootlegger	 who	 died	 of	 cirrhosis.	 His	 mother	 had	 remarried	 often	 and	 badly.
Unrestrained	by	a	normal	family	life,	Link	hit	the	streets	at	the	age	of	twelve	and
soon	mastered	petty	thievery.	By	fifteen,	he	had	his	own	gang	and	was	selling	pot
and	porn	in	our	high	schools.	He	was	arrested	at	sixteen,	got	a	slap	on	the	wrist,
and	thus	began	a	long	and	colorful	relationship	with	the	criminal	justice	system.
Until	 he	 was	 twenty,	 his	 name	 was	 George.	 It	 didn’t	 fit,	 so	 he	 adopted	 and
discarded	several	nicknames,	jewels	such	as	Lash	and	Boss.	He	finally	settled	on
Link	 because	 he,	 George	 Scanlon,	 was	 so	 often	 linked	 to	 various	 crimes.	 Link	 fit
him	 nicely	 and	 he	 hired	 a	 lawyer	 to	 make	 it	 legal.	 Just	 Link	 Scanlon,	 no	 middle
initial,	nothing	stuck	on	the	end.	The	new	name	gave	him	a	new	identity.	He	was	a
new	man	with	something	to	prove.	He	became	reckless	in	his	desire	to	become	the
toughest	mobster	in	town,	and	he	was	quite	successful.	By	the	time	he	was	thirty,
Link’s	 thugs	 were	 killing	 regularly	 as	 he	 took	 over	 the	 City’s	 skin	 business	 and
cornered	his	share	of	the	drug	traffic.
He	has	been	on	death	row	for	only	six	years	and	his	execution	is	scheduled	for
10:00	tonight.	Six	years	is	not	long	on	death	row;	on	the	average,	at	least	in	this
state,	 the	 appeals	 drag	 on	 for	 fourteen	 years	 before	 an	 execution.	 Twenty	 is	 not
unusual.	The	shortest	was	two	years,	but	that	guy	begged	for	the	needle.	It’s	fair	to
say	Link’s	case	has	been	rushed	along,	or	expedited.	Kill	a	judge	and	all	the	other

judges	 take	 offense.	 His	 appeals	 were	 met	 with	 surprisingly	 few	 delays.	 His
conviction	 was	 affirmed,	 affirmed,	 and	 reaffirmed.	 All	 rulings	 were	 unanimous,
not	 a	 single	 dissent	 anywhere,	 state	 or	 federal.	 The	 U.S.	 Supremes	 refused	 to
consider	his	case.	Link	pissed	off	those	who	truly	run	the	system,	and	tonight	the
system	gets	the	ultimate	revenge.
Judge	Nagy	was	the	one	Link	killed.	He,	Link,	didn’t	actually	pull	the	trigger;
instead	 he	 sent	 word	 down	 the	 line	 that	 he	 wanted	 Nagy	 dead.	 A	 career	 hitter
called	 Knuckles	 got	 the	 assignment	 and	 carried	 things	 out	 in	 splendid	 fashion.
They	found	Judge	Nagy	and	his	wife	in	bed,	in	their	pajamas,	bullet	holes	in	their
heads.	Knuckles	then	talked	too	much	and	the	cops	had	a	wire	in	the	right	place.
Knuckles	 was	 on	 death	 row	 too,	 for	 about	 two	 years,	 until	 they	 found	 him	 with
Drano	 packed	 in	 his	 mouth	 and	 throat.	 The	 cops	 quizzed	 Link	 but	 he	 swore	 he
didn’t	know	a	thing	about	it.
What	 was	 Judge	 Nagy’s	 offense?	 He	 was	 a	 tough	 law-and-order	 type	 who
hated	drugs	and	was	famous	for	throwing	the	book	at	traffickers.	He	was	about	to
sentence	 two	 of	 Link’s	 favorite	 henchmen—one	 was	 his	 cousin—to	 a	 hundred
years	 each,	 and	 this	 upset	 Link.	 It	 was	 his	 town,	 not	 Nagy’s.	 He,	 Link,	 had	 been
wanting	to	knock	off	a	judge	for	years;	sort	of	the	ultimate	takedown.	Kill	a	judge,
walk	away	from	it,	and	the	world	knows	you	are	indeed	above	the	law.
After	his	defense	lawyer	was	murdered,	folks	thought	I	was	a	fool	to	take	his
case.	 Another	 bad	 outcome	 for	 Link,	 and	 they	 might	 find	 me	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 a
lake.	 But	 that	 was	 six	 years	 ago,	 and	 Link	 and	 I	 have	 gotten	 along	 just	 fine.	 He
knows	I’ve	tried	to	save	his	life.	He’ll	spare	mine.	What	would	he	gain	by	killing
his	last	lawyer?

2.
Partner	and	I	pull	in	to	the	main	gate	at	Big	Wheeler,	the	maximum	security
prison	 where	 the	 State	 maintains	 its	 death	 row	 and	 does	 its	 executing.	 A	 guard
steps	to	the	passenger	door	and	says,	“Name?”
“Rudd,	Sebastian	Rudd.	Here	to	see	Link	Scanlon.”
“Of	 course.”	 The	 guard’s	 name	 is	 Harvey	 and	 we’ve	 chatted	 before,	 but	 not
tonight.	 Tonight	 Big	 Wheeler	 is	 locked	 down	 and	 there	 is	 a	 thrill	 in	 the	 air.	 It’s
execution	time!	Across	the	road,	some	protesters	with	candles	sing	a	solemn	hymn
while	 others	 chant	 support	 for	 the	 death	 penalty.	 Back	 and	 forth.	 There	 are	 TV
news	vans	lining	the	highway.
Harvey	 scribbles	 something	 on	 a	 clipboard,	 says,	 “Unit	 Nine,”	 and	 as	 we’re
about	to	drive	away	he	leans	in	and	whispers,	“What	are	your	chances?”
“Slim,”	 I	 say	 as	 we	 begin	 moving.	 We	 follow	 a	 prison	 security	 truck	 with
gunmen	standing	in	the	back;	another	one	trails	us.	Floodlights	nearly	blind	us	as
we	inch	along,	passing	brightly	lit	buildings	where	three	thousand	men	are	locked
in	their	cells	and	waiting	for	Link	to	die	so	things	can	return	to	normal.	There	is
no	 sensible	 reason	 for	 a	 prison	 to	 go	 nuts	 when	 there’s	 an	 execution.	 Extra
security	 is	 never	 needed.	 No	 one	 has	 ever	 escaped	 from	 death	 row.	 The
condemned	men	there	live	in	isolation,	and	thus	do	not	have	a	gang	of	friends	who
might	decide	to	storm	the	Bastille	and	free	everyone.	But	rituals	are	important	to
the	 men	 who	 run	 prisons,	 and	 nothing	 gets	 their	 adrenaline	 pumping	 like	 an
execution.	 Their	 little	 lives	 are	 mundane	 and	 monotonous,	 but	 occasionally	 the
world	tunes	in	when	it’s	time	to	kill	a	killer.	No	effort	at	heightened	drama	is	to	be
missed.
Unit	Nine	is	far	away	from	the	other	units,	with	enough	chain	link	and	razor
wire	around	it	to	stop	Ike	on	the	beaches	of	Normandy.	We	eventually	reach	a	gate
where	 a	 platoon	 of	 jumpy	 guards	 can’t	 wait	 to	 search	 Partner	 and	 me	 and	 our
briefcases.	 These	 boys	 are	 far	 too	 excited	 about	 the	 evening’s	 festivities.	 With
escorts	 we	 enter	 the	 building,	 and	 I’m	 led	 to	 a	 makeshift	 office	 where	 Warden
McDuff	is	waiting,	chewing	his	fingernails,	obviously	wired.	When	we’re	alone	in	a
room	with	no	windows	he	says,	“Have	you	heard?”
“Heard	what?”
“Ten	 minutes	 ago,	 a	 bomb	 went	 off	 in	 the	 Old	 Courthouse,	 same	 courtroom
Link	got	convicted	in.”
I’ve	been	in	that	courtroom	a	hundred	times,	so,	yes,	I	am	shocked	to	hear	it’s
been	 bombed.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 I’m	 not	 at	 all	 surprised	 to	 discover	 that	 Link
Scanlon	does	not	intend	to	go	quietly.

“Anybody	hurt?”	I	ask.
“Don’t	think	so.	The	courthouse	had	just	closed.”
“Wow.”
“Wow’s	right.	You	better	talk	to	him,	Rudd,	and	quick.”
I	shrug	and	give	the	warden	a	hopeless	look.	Trying	to	talk	sense	to	a	gangster
like	Link	Scanlon	is	a	waste	of	time.	“I’m	just	his	lawyer,”	I	say.
“What	if	he	hurts	somebody…”
“Come	on,	Warden.	The	State’s	executing	him	in	a	few	hours.	What	else	can	it
do	to	him?”
“I	 know,	 I	 know.	 Where	 are	 the	 appeals?”	 he	 asks,	 crunching	 a	 sliver	 of	 a
thumbnail	between	his	front	teeth.	He’s	about	to	jump	out	of	his	skin.
“Fifteenth	Circuit,”	I	say.	“A	Hail	Mary.	They’re	all	Hail	Marys	at	this	point,
Warden.	Where’s	Link?”
“In	the	holding	room.	I	got	to	get	back	to	my	office	and	talk	to	the	governor.”
“Tell	 him	 I	 said	 hello.	 Tell	 him	 he	 still	 hasn’t	 ruled	 on	 my	 last	 request	 for	 a
reprieve.”
“I’ll	do	that,”	the	warden	says	as	he’s	leaving	the	room.
“Thanks.”
Few	 people	 in	 this	 state	 love	 an	 execution	 as	 much	 as	 our	 handsome
governor.	 His	 routine	 is	 to	 wait	 until	 the	 last	 possible	 moment,	 then	 appear
somberly	 in	 front	 of	 the	 cameras	 and	 announce	 to	 the	 world	 that	 he	 cannot,	 in
good	conscience,	grant	a	reprieve.	On	the	verge	of	tears,	he’ll	talk	about	the	victim
and	declare	that	justice	must	be	done.
I	follow	two	guards	dressed	in	full	military	gear	through	a	maze	and	come	to
the	 Boom	 Boom	 Room.	 It’s	 nothing	 more	 than	 a	 large	 holding	 cell	 where	 the
condemned	is	placed	precisely	five	hours	before	his	big	moment.	There,	he	waits
with	his	lawyer,	spiritual	adviser,	and	maybe	some	family.	Full	contact	is	allowed,
and	there	can	be	some	pretty	sad	moments	when	Momma	arrives	for	the	final	hug.
The	 last	 meal	 is	 served	 precisely	 two	 hours	 before	 the	 final	 walk,	 and	 after	 that
only	the	lawyer	can	hang	around.
In	 decades	 past,	 our	 state	 used	 a	 firing	 squad.	 Cuffed	 and	 bound,	 the
condemned	was	strapped	to	a	chair,	a	black	veil	was	dropped	over	his	head,	and	a
bright	 red	 cross	 was	 attached	 to	 his	 shirt,	 over	 his	 heart.	 Fifty	 feet	 away,	 five
volunteers	 waited	 behind	 a	 curtain	 with	 high-powered	 rifles,	 though	 only	 four
were	loaded.	The	theory	was	that	none	of	the	five	would	ever	know	for	sure	that	he
killed	a	man,	and	this	was	somehow	supposed	to	assuage	his	guilt	later	in	life,	in
the	 event	 that	 he	 had	 a	 change	 of	 heart	 and	 became	 burdened.	 What	 a	 crock!
There	was	a	long	list	of	volunteers,	all	eager	to	put	a	bullet	dead	center	in	another

man’s	heart.
Anyway,	 prison	 lingo	 is	 vibrant	 and	 creative,	 and	 over	 time	 the	 execution
room	picked	up	its	nickname.	Legend	has	it	that	an	air	vent	was	intentionally	left
open	so	the	cracking	sound	of	the	rifles	echoed	over	the	prison.	When	we	adopted
the	 needle,	 for	 humane	 reasons,	 less	 space	 was	 needed.	 Death	 row	 was
reconfigured;	 walls	 were	 added	 here	 and	 there.	 Supposedly,	 the	 current	 Boom
Boom	Room	includes	the	very	spot	where	the	condemned	men	sat	and	waited	for
the	bullets.
They	 frisk	 me	 again	 and	 I	 walk	 through	 the	 door.	 Link	 is	 alone,	 sitting	 in	 a
folding	 chair	 that	 is	 leaning	 against	 a	 cinder-block	 wall.	 The	 lights	 are	 low.	 He’s
glued	 to	 a	 small	 muted	 television	 screen	 hanging	 in	 a	 corner,	 and	 he	 does	 not
acknowledge	 my	 arrival.	 His	 favorite	 movie	 is	 The	Godfather.	 He’s	 watched	 it	 a
hundred	times,	and	years	ago	began	working	on	his	imitation	of	Marlon	Brando.
Scratchy,	 painful	 voice,	 one	 he	 blames	 on	 smoking.	 Clenched	 jaw.	 Slow	 delivery.
Aloof.	Completely	devoid	of	emotion.
Our	death	row	has	a	unique	rule	that	allows	the	condemned	man	to	die	in	any
clothing	he	chooses.	It’s	a	ridiculous	rule	because,	after	living	here	for	ten,	fifteen,
or	twenty	years,	these	guys	have	nothing	in	the	way	of	a	wardrobe.	Standard-issue
coveralls;	 maybe	 a	 pair	 of	 frayed	 khakis	 and	 a	 T-shirt	 to	 wear	 during	 visitation;
sandals;	 thick	 socks	 for	 the	 winter.	 Link,	 though,	 has	 money	 and	 wants	 to	 be
buried	in	solid	black.	He’s	wearing	a	black	linen	shirt	with	long	sleeves	buttoned	at
the	wrists,	black	denim	jeans,	black	socks,	and	black	running	shoes.	It’s	not	nearly
as	stylish	as	he	thinks,	but	at	this	point	who	cares	about	fashion?
Finally	he	says,	“I	thought	you	were	going	to	save	me.”
“I	never	said	that,	Link.	I	even	put	it	in	writing.”
“But	I	paid	you	all	that	money.”
“A	fat	fee	is	no	guarantee	of	a	good	outcome.	That’s	in	writing	too.”
“Lawyers,”	 he	 grunts	 in	 disgust,	 and	 I	 don’t	 take	 this	 lightly.	 I	 have	 never
forgotten	what	happened	to	his	last	one.	He	slowly	leans	forward,	tipping	his	chair
onto	 all	 fours,	 and	 stands	 up.	 Link	 is	 fifty	 now,	 and	 for	 most	 of	 his	 time	 on	 the
Row	 he’s	 managed	 to	 maintain	 his	 good	 looks.	 But	 he’s	 aging	 quickly,	 though	 I
doubt	if	anyone	with	a	firm	execution	date	worries	too	much	about	wrinkles	and
gray	hair.	He	takes	a	few	steps	and	turns	off	the	television.
The	room	is	maybe	fifteen	by	fifteen,	with	a	small	desk,	three	folding	chairs,
and	a	cheap	Army-style	cot,	just	in	case	the	condemned	might	want	to	catch	a	few
winks	before	being	sent	to	his	eternal	rest.	I	was	here	once	before,	three	years	ago,
when	 my	 client	 came	 within	 thirty	 minutes	 of	 getting	 the	 needle	 before	 we	 were
handed	a	miracle	by	the	Fifteenth	Circuit.
Link	will	not	be	so	lucky.	He	sits	on	a	corner	of	the	desk	and	looks	down	at
me.	He	grunts	and	says,	“I	trusted	you.”

“And	with	good	reason,	Link.	I	fought	like	hell	for	you.”
“But	I’m	insane,	legally,	and	you	haven’t	convinced	anyone	of	it.	Crazy	as	hell.
Why	can’t	you	make	them	see	this?”
“I	have	tried	and	you	know	it,	Link.	No	one	listened	because	no	one	wanted	to
listen.	 You	 killed	 the	 wrong	 person,	 a	 judge.	 Kill	 a	 judge,	 and	 his	 brethren	 take
offense.”
“I	didn’t	kill	him.”
“Well,	 the	 jury	 said	 you	 did.	 That’s	 all	 that	 matters.”	 We’ve	 had	 this
conversation	 a	 thousand	 times,	 and	 why	 not	 have	 it	 again?	 Right	 now,	 with	 less
than	five	hours	to	go,	I’ll	chat	with	Link	on	any	subject.
“I’m	insane,	Sebastian.	My	mind	is	gone.”
It	is	often	said	that	everyone	goes	crazy	on	death	row.	Twenty-three	hours	a
day	in	isolation	breaks	a	man	mentally,	physically,	and	emotionally.	Link,	though,
has	 not	 exactly	 suffered	 like	 the	 rest.	 Years	 ago	 I	 explained	 to	 him	 that	 the	 U.S.
Supreme	 Court	 has	 ruled	 that	 a	 state	 cannot	 execute	 a	 person	 who	 is	 either
mentally	 retarded	 or	 who	 becomes	 mentally	 unsound.	 Soon	 thereafter,	 Link
decided	he	should	go	insane	and	he’s	been	acting	so	ever	since.	The	warden	at	that
time	 agreed	 to	 move	 Link	 to	 the	 psych	 unit,	 where	 he	 enjoyed	 a	 much	 more
comfortable	lockup.	Link	lived	there	for	three	years	before	a	journalist	dug	deep
enough	 to	 discover	 a	 money	 trail	 between	 various	 members	 of	 the	 warden’s
immediate	family	and	a	certain	crime	syndicate.	The	warden	quickly	retired	and
dodged	an	indictment.	Link	got	slammed	back	to	death	row,	where	he	stayed	for
about	 a	 month	 before	 getting	 moved	 to	 PC—protective	 custody.	 There,	 he	 had	 a
larger	cell	and	more	privileges.	The	guards	gave	him	anything	he	wanted	because
Link’s	boys	on	the	outside	were	taking	care	of	the	guards	with	cash	and	drugs.	In
time,	Link	manipulated	a	transfer	back	to	the	psych	unit.
In	his	six	years	at	Big	Wheeler,	he’s	spent	about	twelve	months	locked	up	with
the	other	killers	on	death	row.
I	 say,	 “The	 warden	 just	 told	 me	 the	 courthouse	 got	 bombed	 this	 afternoon.
Same	courtroom	where	you	got	convicted.	What	a	coincidence,	huh?”
He	frowns	and	offers	a	casual,	Brando-like	shrug,	revealing	nothing.	“I	got	an
appeal	floating	somewhere	right	now?”	he	says.
“It’s	at	the	Fifteenth	Circuit,	but	don’t	get	excited.”
“Are	you	telling	me	I’m	gonna	die,	Sebastian?”
“I	 told	 you	 that	 last	 week,	 Link.	 The	 fix	 is	 in.	 The	 last-minute	 appeals	 are
worthless.	Everything’s	been	litigated.	Every	issue	covered.	There’s	little	we	can	do
right	now	but	wait	and	hope	for	a	miracle.”
“I	shoulda	hired	that	radical	Jew	lawyer,	what’s	his	name,	Lowenstein?”

“Maybe,	 but	 you	 didn’t.	 He’s	 had	 three	 clients	 executed	 in	 the	 past	 four
years.”
Marc	Lowenstein	is	an	acquaintance	of	mine	and	a	fine	lawyer.	Between	the
two	of	us,	we	handle	most	of	the	untouchable	cases	in	our	end	of	the	state.	My	cell
phone	vibrates.	It’s	a	text	message—the	Fifteenth	Circuit	has	just	denied.
I	say,	“Bad	news,	Link,	the	Fifteenth	just	turned	us	down.”
He	 says	 nothing	 but	 reaches	 over	 and	 turns	 on	 the	 television.	 I	 turn	 the
switch	for	more	lighting	and	ask,	“Is	your	son	stopping	by	tonight?”
He	grunts,	“No.”
He	has	one	child,	a	son	who	just	got	out	of	federal	prison.	Extortion.	He	grew
up	 in	 the	 family	 business	 and	 loves	 his	 old	 man,	 but	 no	 one	 can	 blame	 him	 for
avoiding	a	prison,	if	only	for	a	visit.	Link	says,	“We’ve	said	good-bye	already.”
“So	no	guests	tonight?”
He	 grunts,	 says	 nothing.	 No,	 no	 visitors	 for	 the	 last	 hug.	 Link	 was	 married
twice	but	hates	both	ex-wives.	He	hasn’t	spoken	to	his	mother	in	twenty	years.	His
only	brother	mysteriously	disappeared	after	a	bad	business	deal.	Link	reaches	into
his	 pocket,	 produces	 a	 cell	 phone,	 and	 makes	 a	 call.	 Inmate	 cell	 phones	 are
violently	 forbidden,	 and	 they’ve	 caught	 Link	 with	 a	 dozen	 over	 the	 years.	 The
guards	sneak	them	in;	one	who	got	caught	said	he	was	paid	$1,000	in	cash	by	a
stranger	in	a	Burger	King	parking	lot,	after	lunch.
It’s	a	quick	call—I	can’t	understand	a	word—and	Link	returns	the	phone	to	his
pocket.	 Using	 the	 remote,	 he	 changes	 channels	 and	 we	 watch	 a	 local	 cable	 news
show.	 There’s	 a	 lot	 of	 interest	 in	 his	 execution.	 A	 reporter	 does	 a	 nice	 job	 of
recapping	the	Nagy	murders.	They	flash	photos	of	the	judge	and	his	wife,	a	pretty
lady.
I	knew	the	judge	well	and	appeared	several	times	in	his	courtroom.	He	was	a
hard-ass	but	fair	and	smart.	We	were	shocked	when	he	was	murdered,	but	not	too
surprised	 when	 the	 trail	 led	 to	 Link	 Scanlon.	 They	 run	 a	 clip	 of	 Knuckles,	 the
gunman,	as	he’s	leaving	court	in	handcuffs.	What	a	nasty	one.
I	say,	“You	know	you’re	entitled	to	the	counsel	of	a	spiritual	adviser?”
He	grunts.	No.
“The	prison	has	a	chaplain,	if	you’d	like	a	word	with	him.”
“What’s	a	chaplain?”
“A	man	of	God.”
“And	what	might	he	say	to	me?”
“Oh,	I	don’t	know,	Link.	I’m	told	that	some	folks,	right	before	they	pass,	like
to	get	things	right	with	God.	Confess	their	sins,	stuff	like	that.”

“That	might	take	some	time.”
Contrition	would	be	an	inexcusable	act	of	weakness	for	a	mobster	like	Link.
He	has	absolutely	no	remorse,	for	the	Nagy	murders	or	for	all	those	before	them.
He	glares	at	me	and	says,	“What	are	you	doing	here?”
“I’m	 your	 lawyer.	 It’s	 my	 job	 to	 be	 here,	 to	 make	 sure	 the	 final	 appeals	 run
their	course.	To	give	advice.”
“And	your	advice	is	to	talk	to	a	chaplain?”
We’re	startled	by	a	loud	knock	on	the	door.	It	opens	immediately	and	a	man
in	 a	 cheap	 suit	 strolls	 in,	 with	 two	 guards	 as	 escorts.	 He	 says,	 “Mr.	 Scanlon,	 I’m
Jess	Foreman,	assistant	warden.”
“A	real	pleasure,”	Link	says	without	taking	his	eyes	off	the	television.
Foreman	ignores	me	and	says,	“I	have	a	list	of	all	those	who	will	witness	the
execution.	There’s	nobody	on	your	list,	right?”
“Right.”
“Are	you	sure?”
Link	 ignores	 this.	 Foreman	 waits,	 then	 says,	 “What	 about	 your	 lawyer?”	 He
looks	at	me.
“I’ll	be	there,”	I	say.	The	lawyer	is	always	invited	to	watch.
“Anybody	from	Judge	Nagy’s	family?”	I	ask.
“Yep,	all	three	of	his	children.”	Foreman	places	the	list	on	the	desk	and	leaves.
As	 the	 door	 slams	 behind	 him,	 Link	 says,	 “Here	 it	 is.”	 He	 lifts	 the	 remote,
increases	the	volume.
It’s	 a	 breaking	 story—a	 bomb	 just	 exploded	 in	 the	 stately	 courthouse	 where
the	 Fifteenth	 Circuit	 does	 its	 work.	 The	 scene	 outside	 is	 frantic	 as	 police	 and
firemen	 scurry	 about.	 Smoke	 boils	 from	 a	 second-floor	 window.	 A	 breathless
reporter	is	moving	along	the	street	with	his	cameraman	in	tow,	looking	for	a	better
angle	and	gushing	on	about	what’s	happening.
Link’s	eyes	glow	as	he	watches.	I	say,	“Wow,	another	coincidence.”	But	Link
does	not	hear	me.	I	try	to	act	cool,	calm,	as	if	this	is	no	big	deal.	A	bomb	here,	a
bomb	there.	Couple	of	phone	calls	from	death	row	and	the	fuses	get	lit.	But	I	am
astonished.
Who	 might	 be	 next?	 Another	 judge,	 perhaps	 the	 one	 who	 presided	 over	 his
trial	 and	 sentenced	 him	 to	 death?	 That	 was	 Judge	 Cone,	 since	 retired,	 and	 for
about	two	years,	during	and	after	the	trial,	he	had	armed	protection.	Perhaps	the
jurors?	They	lived	cautiously	thereafter	with	the	cops	close	by.	No	one	was	hurt	or
threatened.
Link	grunts,	“Where	does	the	appeal	go	now?”

I	 guess	 he	 plans	 to	 bomb	 every	 courthouse	 from	 here	 to	 Washington.	 He
knows	 the	 answer	 to	 his	 question;	 we’ve	 discussed	 it	 enough.	 I	 reply,	 “The
Supremes,	in	D.C.	Why	do	you	ask?”
He	ignores	this.	We	watch	the	television	for	a	while.	CNN	picks	up	the	story
and	 in	 its	 usual,	 hysterical	 fashion	 soon	 has	 us	 on	 red	 alert,	 as	 if	 jihadists	 were
invading.
Link	is	smiling.
Half	an	hour	later,	the	warden	is	back,	fidgeting	more	than	ever.	He	pulls	me
out	of	the	room	and	hisses,	“You’ve	heard	about	the	Fifteenth	Circuit?”
“We’re	watching	it.”
“You	gotta	stop	him.”
“Who?”
“Don’t	‘Who’	me,	dammit!	You	know	what	I’m	talking	about.”
“We’re	 not	 in	 control	 here,	 Warden.	 The	 courts	 run	 their	 own	 schedules.
Link’s	 boys	 have	 their	 orders,	 evidently.	 Besides,	 the	 bombings	 might	 be
coincidental.”
“Yeah,	right.	The	FBI	is	on	the	way	here	right	now.”
“Oh,	 that’s	 real	 good,	 real	 smart.	 My	 client	 gets	 the	 needle	 in	 exactly	 three
hours	and	fourteen	minutes,	yet	the	FBI	wants	to	grill	him	about	these	bombings.
He’s	 a	 seasoned	 thug,	 Warden,	 a	 gangster	 from	 the	 old	 school.	 Battle	 hardened.
He’ll	spit	on	any	FBI	agent	within	twenty	feet.”
He	looks	like	he’s	about	to	faint.	“We	gotta	do	something,”	he	says,	wild-eyed.
“The	governor’s	yelling	at	me.	Everybody’s	yelling	at	me.”
“Well,	it’s	up	to	the	gov,	if	you	ask	me.	He	grants	the	reprieve,	and	I	suppose
Link	stops	the	bombing	campaign.	Not	sure,	though,	because	he’s	not	listening	to
me.”
“Can	you	ask	him?”
I	laugh	out	loud.	“Sure,	Warden,	I’ll	just	have	a	little	heart-to-heart	with	my
client,	get	him	to	confess,	and	convince	him	to	stop	whatever	he’ll	admit	to	doing.
No	problem.”
He’s	 too	 ashen	 to	 strike	 back,	 so	 he	 leaves,	 shaking	 his	 head,	 chewing	 his
nails,	 another	 bureaucrat	 thoroughly	 overwhelmed	 with	 decision	 making.	 I	 step
back	into	the	room	and	take	a	chair.	Link	is	glued	to	the	television.
“That	was	the	warden,”	I	say.	“And	they’d	really	appreciate	it	if	you’d	call	off
the	dogs.”
No	response.	No	acknowledgment.
CNN	 finally	 connects	 the	 dots,	 and	 suddenly	 my	 client	 is	 the	 hour’s	 hottest

story.	 They	 flash	 a	 mug	 shot	 of	 Link,	 a	 much	 younger	 version,	 as	 they	 interview
the	 prosecutor	 who	 sent	 him	 away.	 From	 across	 the	 desk,	 Link	 curses	 under	 his
breath,	 though	 he’s	 still	 smiling.	 None	 of	 my	 business,	 but	 if	 I	 were	 inclined	 to
plant	bombs,	this	guy’s	office	would	be	at	the	top	of	my	list.
His	name	is	Max	Mancini,	the	City’s	chief	prosecutor	and	a	true	legend	in	his
own	 mind.	 He’s	 been	 popping	 off	 in	 the	 press	 all	 week	 as	 the	 countdown	 grew
louder.	 Link	 will	 be	 his	 first	 execution,	 and	 he	 wouldn’t	 miss	 it	 for	 anything.
Frankly,	I’ve	never	understood	why	Link	chose	to	rub	out	his	own	defense	lawyer
instead	of	going	after	Mancini.	But	I	won’t	ask.
Evidently,	Link	and	I	are	on	the	same	page.	Just	as	the	reporter	is	wrapping
up	 the	 interview,	 there	 is	 a	 loud	 noise	 somewhere	 in	 the	 background,	 behind
Mancini.	The	camera	pulls	back	and	it’s	clear	to	me	that	they’re	standing	on	the
sidewalk	outside	his	downtown	office.
Another	explosion.

3.
The	 courtroom	 was	 bombed	 at	 precisely	 5:00	 p.m.;	 the	 Fifteenth	 Circuit,
precisely	at	6:00;	the	prosecutor’s	office,	precisely	at	7:00.
As	 we	 approach	 8:00	 p.m.,	 many	 people	 who’ve	 had	 the	 misfortune	 of
crossing	 paths	 with	 my	 client	 are	 nervous.	 CNN,	 now	 in	 full	 unbridled	 frenzy,	 is
reporting	that	security	has	been	beefed	up	around	the	Supreme	Court	Building	in
Washington.	Their	reporter	on	the	scene	keeps	showing	us	a	few	offices	with	lights
on	and	we’re	supposed	to	believe	the	justices	are	up	there,	hard	at	work,	debating
the	merits	of	Link’s	case.	They	are	not.	They’re	all	safely	at	home	or	at	dinner.	One
of	their	clerks	will	deny	our	petition	any	minute	now.
The	Governor’s	Mansion	is	crawling	with	state	police,	some	armed	from	head
to	 toe	 in	 full	 combat	 regalia,	 as	 if	 Link	 might	 decide	 to	 mount	 a	 ground	 assault.
With	 so	 many	 cameras	 around,	 so	 much	 drama	 everywhere,	 our	 handsome
governor	couldn’t	help	himself.	Ten	minutes	ago	he	dashed	out	from	his	bunker	to
chat	with	the	reporters,	live	of	course.	Said	he	wasn’t	frightened,	justice	must	go
on,	he’d	do	his	job	without	fear,	et	cetera,	ad	nauseam.	He	tried	to	act	as	though
he’s	 really	 wrestling	 with	 the	 reprieve	 issue,	 so	 he’s	 not	 ready	 to	 announce	 his
decision.	 He’ll	 save	 it	 for	 later,	 say	 around	 9:55.	 He	 hasn’t	 had	 this	 much	 fun	 in
years.
I’m	 tempted	 to	 ask	 Link,	 “Who’s	 next?”	 but	 let	 it	 pass.	 We’re	 playing	 gin
rummy	 as	 the	 clock	 ticks	 and	 Rome	 burns.	 He’s	 told	 me	 several	 times	 I	 could
leave,	but	I’m	hanging	around.	I	won’t	admit	that	I’m	keen	to	watch	his	execution,
but	I	am	fascinated	by	it.
No	 one	 has	 been	 hurt.	 The	 three	 bombs	 were	 mainly	 gasoline,	 according	 to
some	 so-called	 expert	 CNN	 dragged	 in	 for	 authenticity.	 Low-tech	 time	 bombs,
probably	in	small	packages,	designed	to	make	a	little	noise	and	a	lot	of	smoke.
At	8:00	p.m.,	everyone	takes	a	deep	breath.	All’s	quiet	for	the	moment.	They
knock	on	the	door	and	wheel	in	the	last	meal.	For	the	occasion,	Link	has	chosen	a
steak	with	fries	and	coconut	pie	for	dessert,	but	he	has	no	appetite.	He	takes	two
bites	 of	 the	 steak	 and	 offers	 me	 the	 fries.	 I	 say	 no	 thanks	 and	 shuffle	 the	 deck.
There’s	something	about	eating	another	man’s	last	meal	that	doesn’t	seem	right.
At	 8:15,	 my	 cell	 phone	 vibrates.	 Our	 petition	 has	 been	 denied	 at	 the	 Supreme
Court.	 No	 surprise	 there.	 There’s	 nothing	 left.	 All	 Hail	 Marys	 have	 been	 thrown
and	dropped.
We	 go	 Live!	 outside	 the	 Supreme	 Court	 Building	 in	 Washington,	 where	 the
CNN	 reporter	 is	 practically	 praying	 for	 some	 type	 of	 explosion.	 Dozens	 of	 cops
loiter	about,	their	trigger	fingers	just	itching.	A	small	crowd	has	gathered	to	watch
the	carnage,	but	there’s	nothing.	Link	keeps	one	eye	on	the	television	as	he	deals
the	cards.

I	suspect	he’s	not	finished.

4.
The	prison	has	a	food	storage	warehouse	on	the	west	side	of	its	vast	complex
and	a	vehicle	maintenance	facility	on	the	east	side.	The	buildings	are	about	three
miles	apart.	At	8:30,	both	mysteriously	catch	on	fire,	and	the	prison	goes	berserk.
Evidently,	there	are	a	couple	of	news	helicopters	in	the	area.	They	are	not	allowed
to	fly	over	Big	Wheeler,	so	they’re	hovering	above	farmland	next	door,	and	thanks
to	their	long-range	lenses	we’re	able	to	watch	the	excitement	courtesy	of	CNN.
As	Link	toys	with	his	coconut	pie	and	plays	gin	rummy,	the	anchor	wonders
why	the	State	doesn’t	speed	up	his	execution	before	he	burns	down	the	prison.	A
stuttering	 spokesperson	 with	 the	 governor’s	 office	 tries	 to	 explain	 that	 the	 rules
and	 laws	 do	 not	 allow	 this.	 It’s	 10:00	 p.m.,	 period,	 or	 as	 soon	 thereafter	 as
possible.	Link	watches	this	as	if	it’s	a	movie	about	some	other	guy	on	death	row.
At	 8:45,	 a	 bomb	 goes	 off	 in	 the	 administration	 building,	 not	 far	 from	 the
warden’s	office.
Ten	 minutes	 later,	 the	 warden	 bursts	 into	 the	 Boom	 Boom	 Room	 and
screams,	“You	gotta	stop	this!”	Link	ignores	him	as	he	shuffles	the	cards.
Two	 nervous	 guards	 grab	 Link,	 lift	 him	 up,	 search	 him,	 find	 his	 cell	 phone,
then	throw	him	back	into	his	chair.	His	face	does	not	change	expression.
“You	got	a	phone,	Rudd?”	the	warden	yells	at	me.
“Yes,	but	you	can’t	have	it.	Rule	36,	section	2,	paragraph	4.	Your	rule.	Sorry.”
“You	son	of	a	bitch!”
“So	you	think	I’m	making	phone	calls	to	the	bad	guys?	You	think	I’m	a	part	of
the	conspiracy,	with	all	my	calls	being	traced?	That	right,	Warden?”
He	 is	 too	 panic-stricken	 to	 respond.	 From	 behind	 the	 warden,	 a	 guard	 yells
into	the	room,	“There’s	a	riot	in	Unit	Six!”

5.
The	riot	started	when	an	inmate,	an	old	lifer	with	a	history	of	heart	problems,
faked	cardiac	arrest.	At	first	the	guards	decided	to	ignore	him	and	let	him	go,	but
on	 second	 thought	 they	 got	 involved.	 His	 cell	 mate	 stabbed	 two	 guards	 with	 a
shank,	 grabbed	 their	 Tasers,	 fried	 them,	 then	 beat	 them	 senseless.	 The	 inmates
quickly	 put	 on	 the	 guards’	 uniforms	 and	 managed	 to	 open	 the	 doors	 to	 about	 a
hundred	cells.	With	near	flawless	coordination,	the	inmates	flooded	other	wings	in
the	 unit	 and	 soon	 several	 hundred	 extremely	 dangerous	 convicts	 were	 on	 the
loose.	 They	 began	 burning	 mattresses,	 laundry,	 anything	 that	 could	 possibly	 be
ignited.	Eight	guards	were	beaten;	two	would	later	die.	Three	guards	with	pistols
hid	in	an	office	and	called	for	help.	Before	long,	the	inmates	found	weapons	and
gunfire	could	be	heard	across	the	prison.	In	the	melee,	four	snitches	were	hanged
with	electrical	extension	cords.
We	wouldn’t	know	these	details	until	later,	so	at	the	time	Link	and	I	casually
play	 cards	 while	 Big	 Wheeler	 explodes	 around	 us.	 It	 takes	 CNN	 less	 than	 five
minutes	 to	 pick	 up	 the	 riot	 story,	 and	 when	 we	 hear	 it	 we	 stop	 and	 watch	 the
television.	After	a	few	minutes	I	say,	“So,	Link,	are	you	in	charge	of	prison	riots,
too?”
To	my	surprise	he	says,	“Yes,	at	this	moment	anyway.”
“Oh	really?	Then	tell	me	how	this	one	started?”
“It	all	goes	back	to	personnel,”	he	says	like	a	polished	CEO.	“You	gotta	have
the	right	people	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time.	You	got	three	guys	in	Unit	Six
doing	life	with	no	parole,	so	they	got	nothing	to	lose.	You	set	up	an	outside	contact
who	promises	all	sorts	of	stuff,	like	a	van	and	a	driver	waiting	in	the	woods	if	the
guys	make	it	out.	And	lots	of	cash.	You	give	them	plenty	of	time	to	plan	it	all,	and
at	exactly	9:00	on	this	night,	when	the	warden	and	his	goons	are	thinking	of	only
one	thing—giving	me	the	needle—you	launch	your	assault.	Unit	Four	should	blow
up	any	minute.”
“I	won’t	tell	a	soul.	And	the	bombs?	Who	rigged	the	bombs?”
“Can’t	give	you	the	names.	You	gotta	understand	prisons	and	how	stupid	the
men	 are	 who	 run	 them.	 Everything	 here	 is	 designed	 to	 keep	 us	 in,	 with	 little
thought	to	keeping	bad	stuff	out.	Those	incendiary	devices	were	planted	two	days
ago,	well	hidden;	they’ve	got	timers	and	all,	really	basic	stuff.	No	one	was	looking,
piece	of	cake.”
It’s	a	relief	to	hear	him	talking	like	this.	I	suppose	his	nerves	are	starting	to
jump,	though	he	looks	as	calm	as	ever.
“What’s	 the	 endgame	 tonight,	 Link?	 Are	 these	 guys	 gonna	 attack	 death	 row
and	rescue	you?”

“Wouldn’t	work.	Too	many	guns	around	here.	Just	having	some	fun,	that’s	all.
I’m	at	peace.”
As	 he	 says	 this,	 they	 flash	 another	 image	 of	 the	 prison	 burning,	 another
camera	 shot	 from	 a	 helicopter	 nearby.	 We’re	 too	 deep	 in	 the	 building	 to	 hear
anything,	 but	 it	 looks	 like	 total	 chaos.	 Buildings	 on	 fire,	 a	 million	 red	 and	 blue
lights	 flashing,	 an	 occasional	 gunshot.	 Link	 can’t	 help	 but	 smile.	 Just	 fun	 and
games.
“It’s	 the	 warden’s	 own	 stupid	 fault,”	 he	 says.	 “Why	 all	 the	 pomp	 and
ceremony,	 just	 for	 an	 execution?	 He	 brings	 in	 every	 available	 guard,	 gives	 them
automatic	weapons	and	Kevlar	vests	as	if	someone—me,	the	guy	getting	the	needle
—might	somehow	put	together	an	offensive.	Goons	everywhere.	Then	he	turns	on
all	the	lights	and	locks	down	the	entire	prison.	Why	exactly?	No	good	reason.	Hell,
two	 guards	 without	 guns	 could	 just	 as	 easily	 walk	 me	 down	 the	 hall	 at	 the
appointed	 hour	 and	 strap	 me	 onto	 the	 table.	 No	 big	 deal.	 No	 cause	 for	 all	 this
drama.	But	no,	the	warden	likes	his	rituals.	It’s	a	big	moment	for	law	enforcement
and,	hell,	they	gotta	make	the	most	out	of	it.	What	any	fool	can	see,	anyone	but	the
warden,	is	that	he’s	dealing	with	men	who	live	in	cages	and	who	hate	anybody	in	a
uniform.	 They’re	 already	 looking	 for	 trouble,	 so	 you	 crank	 up	 the	 pressure	 on
them	and	they	blow	a	gasket.	Just	takes	someone	like	me	to	facilitate	things.”
He	sips	a	cherry	cola	and	nibbles	a	french	fry.	He’s	got	forty	minutes.
The	door	opens	again	and	Assistant	Warden	Foreman	is	back,	now	with	three
heavily	armed	warriors.	Foreman	says,	“How	you	guys	doing	in	here?”
“Swell,”	I	say.
Nothing	from	Link.
I	say,	“Looks	like	you	boys	got	your	hands	full	out	there.”
He	says,	“Things	are	hopping.	Just	wanted	to	check	on	the	prisoner	and	make
sure	everything	is	okay.”
Link	 glares	 at	 him	 and	 says,	 “This	 is	 my	 last	 hour.	 Why	 can’t	 I	 have	 some
peace	and	quiet?	Please,	you	and	your	goons	just	get	the	hell	outta	here,	okay?”
“We	can	accommodate	you,”	Foreman	says.
“And	take	him	too,”	Link	says,	pointing	at	me.	“I	need	to	be	alone.”
Foreman	says,	“Well,	sorry,	Link,	but	there’s	no	place	for	Mr.	Rudd	to	go.	The
roads	are	blocked	right	now.	We’re	in	super	lockdown.	It’s	not	safe	out	there.”
“And	for	some	reason	I	don’t	feel	so	safe	in	here,”	Link	sneers.	“Can’t	imagine
why.”
“Looks	like	we	should	postpone	the	execution,”	I	say.
“Probably	not	going	to	happen,”	Foreman	says,	backing	away.

They	leave,	slamming	the	door	and	locking	it	from	the	outside.
The	 governor	 feels	 the	 need	 to	 address	 his	 people.	 On	 the	 screen	 we	 see	 his
troubled	face.	He’s	at	a	podium	with	mikes	and	cameras	before	him,	a	politician’s
dream.	Random	questions	are	hurled	at	him,	and	we	soon	learn	that	the	situation
at	Big	Wheeler	is	“tense.”	There	are	casualties,	even	deaths.	There	are	about	two
hundred	 inmates	 “out	 of	 their	 cells,”	 though	 none	 have	 yet	 to	 penetrate	 the
exterior	fences	of	the	prison.	Several	fires	are	now	under	control.	Yes,	it	seems	as
though	 some	 of	 this	 activity	 was	 coordinated	 from	 outside	 the	 prison,	 and,	 no,
there	 is	 no	 evidence	 that	 Link	 Scanlon	 is	 behind	 it,	 not	 yet	 anyway.	 He,	 the
governor,	 has	 called	 in	 the	 National	 Guard,	 though	 the	 state	 police	 have	 things
under	control.	And,	oh,	by	the	way,	he	is	denying	the	final	request	for	a	reprieve.

6.
Protocol	 requires	 that	 the	 condemned	 man	 be	 handcuffed	 at	 9:45	 and
escorted	for	his	final	walk	to	the	death	room.	There	he	is	strapped	to	a	gurney	with
six	thick	leather	bands,	from	his	feet	to	his	forehead.	While	he	is	being	strapped
down,	a	doctor	pokes	around	his	arms	looking	for	a	suitable	vein	while	a	medic	of
some	variety	checks	his	vital	signs.	Ten	feet	away,	behind	glass	windows	and	black
curtains,	the	witnesses	wait	in	two	separate	rooms,	one	for	the	victim,	one	for	the
killer.
An	IV	is	inserted	and	secured	with	tape.	A	large	clock	on	the	wall	allows	the
unlucky	soul	to	count	down	his	last	minutes.	At	precisely	10:00	p.m.,	the	prison
attorney	 reads	 the	 death	 warrant,	 and	 the	 warden	 asks	 the	 condemned	 if	 he	 has
any	last	words.	He	can	say	whatever	he	wants.	It’s	recorded	and	available	online.
He’ll	 say	 a	 few	 words,	 maybe	 proclaim	 his	 innocence	 again,	 maybe	 forgive
everyone,	 maybe	 beg	 for	 forgiveness.	 When	 he’s	 finished,	 the	 warden	 nods	 to	 a
guy	 hidden	 in	 a	 nearby	 room,	 and	 the	 chemicals	 are	 released.	 The	 condemned
begins	 to	 float	 away	 and	 his	 breathing	 becomes	 labored.	 Some	 twelve	 minutes
later,	the	doctor	pronounces	him	dead.
Link	knows	all	this.	Evidently,	he	has	other	plans.	I’m	just	a	guy	in	the	wrong
place	at	the	wrong	time.
At	 9:30,	 all	 electricity	 at	 Big	 Wheeler	 is	 cut	 off—a	 complete	 blackout.	 They
would	later	trace	the	power	failure	to	a	utility	pole	that	got	chainsawed	in	two.	The
backup	 generator	 for	 Unit	 Nine—death	 row—failed	 to	 start	 because	 its	 fuel
injectors	had	been	vandalized.
At	 9:30,	 we	 don’t	 know	 this.	 All	 we	 know	 is	 that	 the	 Boom	 Boom	 Room	 is
pitch-black.	 Link	 jumps	 to	 his	 feet	 and	 says,	 “Get	 out	 of	 the	 way.”	 He	 slides	 the
desk	to	jam	the	door.	There	is	a	quick	flash	of	light	above	us,	and	noise,	grunting.
A	panel	in	the	false	ceiling	opens	up	and	a	voice	says,	“Link,	here.”	The	flashlight
sweeps	down	and	through	the	room.	A	rope	drops	and	Link	grabs	it.	“Slow,	now,”
the	voice	says,	and	Link	inches	upward,	literally	hanging	on	for	his	life.	There	are
sounds	 up	 there,	 grunting	 and	 scuffling,	 but	 I	 can’t	 tell	 how	 many	 men	 are
involved.
Within	seconds	Link	is	gone,	and	if	I	were	not	so	stunned	I	would	laugh.	Then
I	realize	that	I’ll	probably	get	shot.	I	take	off	my	coat	and	tie	and	stretch	out	on	the
Army	cot.	Guards	kick	the	door	open	and	burst	in	with	guns	and	a	flood	of	light.
“Where	is	he?”	one	guard	barks	at	me.
I	point	to	the	ceiling.
They	 yell	 and	 curse	 as	 two	 of	 them	 yank	 me	 up	 and	 drag	 me	 into	 the	 hall,
where	 dozens	 of	 guards	 and	 cops	 and	 officials	 are	 running	 around	 in	 complete

panic.
“He’s	gone!	He’s	gone!”	They	are	yelling.	“Check	the	roof.”
In	the	hall,	and	in	the	midst	of	an	incredible	racket,	I	can	hear	the	thumping
of	 a	 helicopter.	 They	 drag	 me	 into	 a	 room,	 then	 another.	 In	 the	 chaos	 I	 hear	 a
guard	yell	that	Link	Scanlon	has	vanished.	It	takes	an	hour	for	the	lights	to	come
on.	 I	 am	 eventually	 arrested	 by	 the	 state	 police	 and	 taken	 to	 the	 nearest	 county
jail.	Their	initial	theory	is	that	I	am	an	accomplice.

7.
The	pieces	soon	come	together,	and	because	I	am	being	partially	blamed	for
the	 escape,	 I	 have	 access	 to	 the	 information.	 I’m	 not	 worried	 about	 the	 charges;
they	can’t	stick.
At	 9:30	 that	 night,	 there	 were	 two	 news	 helicopters	 buzzing	 around	 the
fringes	 of	 Big	 Wheeler.	 The	 prison	 officials	 and	 police	 had	 warned	 them	 to	 stay
away,	but	they	were	close	by.	In	a	show	of	muscle,	the	state	police	flew	in	two	of	its
own	 helicopters	 to	 secure	 the	 airspace	 over	 the	 prison,	 and	 this	 proved	 helpful
when	 the	 trouble	 started.	 It	 also	 proved	 distracting.	 There	 was	 a	 tremendous
amount	of	smoke	hanging	over	the	prison	as	six	different	fires	were	blazing	at	one
time.	Witnesses	said	the	noise	was	deafening—four	helicopters	in	the	area,	dozens
of	 emergency	 vehicles	 with	 sirens,	 radios	 squawking,	 guards	 and	 police	 yelling,
guns	 being	 shot,	 fires	 roaring.	 On	 cue,	 and	 with	 impeccable	 timing,	 Link’s	 small
black	 helicopter	 arrived	 from	 nowhere,	 descended	 through	 the	 clouds	 of	 smoke,
and	snatched	him	off	the	roof	of	Unit	Nine.	There	were	witnesses.	Several	guards
and	prison	employees	saw	the	helicopter	as	it	hovered	for	a	few	seconds,	dropped
a	 line,	 then	 disappeared	 back	 into	 the	 smoke	 with	 two	 men	 swinging	 from	 the
lifeline.	A	guard	in	a	tower	at	the	unit	managed	to	fire	a	few	shots	but	hit	nothing.
One	of	the	State’s	choppers	gave	chase,	but	was	no	match	for	whatever	brand
and	model	Link	leased	for	the	night.	It	was	never	found;	no	record	of	it	was	ever
traced.	It	flew	low	to	avoid	radar;	air	traffic	control	did	not	see	it.	A	farmer	sixty
miles	away	from	Big	Wheeler	told	authorities	he	saw	a	small	helicopter	land	on	a
county	road	a	mile	from	his	front	porch.	A	car	met	it,	then	both	disappeared.
An	 investigation	 dragged	 on	 and	 three	 officials	 got	 fired.	 It	 was	 eventually
revealed	that	(1)	the	Boom	Boom	Room	is	part	of	an	old	section	of	Unit	Nine	and
was	built	back	in	the	1940s;	(2)	its	roof	is	three	feet	higher	than	the	rest	of	death
row;	 (3)	 between	 the	 ceiling	 and	 the	 roof	 there	 is	 a	 crawl	 space	 crammed	 with
ductwork,	 heating	 vents,	 and	 electrical	 work;	 (4)	 the	 crawl	 space	 winds	 around
and	branches	off,	and	one	section	of	it	leads	to	an	old	door	that	opens	onto	the	flat
roof;	and	(5)	the	two	guards	who	had	roof	duty	that	night	had	been	dispatched	to
help	with	the	riot,	so	there	was	no	one	on	the	roof	when	Link	made	his	dramatic
escape.
What	 if	 the	 guards	 had	 been	 there?	 Given	 the	 skill	 and	 expertise	 of	 the
operative	who	fetched	Link,	it’s	safe	to	speculate	that	the	guards	would	have	been
shot	 between	 the	 eyes.	 This	 Spider-Man,	 as	 he	 was	 nicknamed	 by	 the
investigators,	is	already	a	legend.
There	 are	 a	 lot	 of	 what-ifs	 but	 few	 answers.	 Faced	 with	 certain	 death,	 Link
Scanlon	figured	he	had	nothing	to	lose	by	attempting	a	ridiculous	escape.	He	had
the	 money	 to	 hire	 the	 right	 commandos	 and	 equipment.	 He	 got	 lucky	 and	 it

worked.
There	was	a	possible	but	unconfirmed	sighting	in	Mexico.
I	haven’t	heard	from	my	client	and	don’t	really	expect	to.

8.
In	addition	to	Big	Wheeler,	there	are	a	dozen	or	so	prisons	in	this	state,	each
with	 a	 different	 security	 classification.	 I	 have	 clients	 in	 most	 of	 them,	 and	 they
write	 me	 letters	 begging	 for	 money	 and	 demanding	 I	 do	 something	 to	 get	 them
out.	 For	 the	 most	 part	 I	 ignore	 this	 correspondence.	 I	 have	 learned	 that	 a	 letter
from	me	only	encourages	an	inmate	to	write	again	and	demand	more.	For	those	of
us	 who	 defend	 criminals,	 there	 is	 always	 the	 possible	 scenario	 in	 which	 an	 exclient	with	a	grudge	shows	up	after	years	in	the	pen	and	wants	to	discuss	mistakes
made	at	trial.	But	I	don’t	dwell	on	this.	It’s	just	part	of	the	job	and	another	reason
I	carry	a	gun.
To	 keep	 me	 in	 my	 place,	 our	 esteemed	 prison	 officials	 ban	 me	 from	 visiting
any	prison	for	an	entire	month	after	the	Scanlon	escape.	However,	as	it	becomes
clear	that	Link	outfoxed	them	with	no	help	from	me,	they	eventually	relent.
There	are	a	few	clients	that	I	visit	occasionally.	These	little	road	trips	get	me
out	 of	 town	 for	 a	 day.	 Partner	 and	 I	 are	 driving	 to	 a	 medium-security	 facility
affectionately	 called	 Old	 Roseburg,	 named	 after	 a	 governor	 from	 the	 1930s	 who
himself	 was	 later	 sent	 to	 prison.	 He	 died	 there,	 in	 a	 slammer	 bearing	 his	 own
name.	I’ve	often	wondered	what	that	felt	like.	According	to	legend,	his	family	tried
in	 vain	 to	 get	 him	 paroled	 so	 he	 could	 die	 at	 home,	 but	 the	 sitting	 governor
wouldn’t	allow	it.	He	and	Roseburg	were	blood	enemies.	The	family	then	tried	to
change	the	name	of	the	prison,	but	that	would	have	ruined	a	colorful	story	and	the
legislature	 declined.	 The	 prison	 officially	 remains	 the	 Nathan	 Roseburg
Correctional	Facility.
We	are	cleared	through	the	main	gate	and	park	in	an	empty	visitors’	lot.	Two
guards	 with	 high-powered	 rifles	 watch	 us	 from	 the	 tower,	 as	 if	 we	 might	 haul	 in
some	weapons	or	a	pound	or	two	of	cocaine.	At	the	moment,	there’s	no	one	else	to
watch,	so	we	get	their	full	attention.

9.
After	Partner	was	acquitted	for	killing	a	narc,	he	begged	me	for	a	job.	I	wasn’t
hiring	at	the	time,	and	I	haven’t	hired	since,	but	I	couldn’t	say	no.	He	was	headed
back	 to	 the	 streets,	 and	 if	 I	 didn’t	 help	 him	 he	 would	 end	 up	 either	 dead	 or	 in
prison.	 Unlike	 most	 of	 his	 friends,	 he	 had	 a	 high	 school	 diploma	 and	 had	 even
managed	to	pick	up	a	few	credits	at	a	community	college.	I	paid	for	more	classes,
most	at	night.	He	blitzed	through	a	paralegal	curriculum	and	got	himself	certified.
Partner	lives	with	his	mother	in	a	subsidized	apartment	in	the	City.	Most	of
the	units	in	his	building	are	packed	with	large	families,	but	none	of	the	traditional
variety—mother,	father,	children.	Almost	all	the	fathers	are	gone,	either	locked	up
or	 living	 elsewhere	 and	 producing	 more	 children.	 The	 typical	 apartment	 belongs
to	a	grandmother,	a	long-suffering	soul	who’s	stuck	with	a	passel	of	kids	who	may
or	may	not	be	blood	related.	Half	the	mothers	are	in	prison.	The	other	half	work
two	 and	 three	 jobs.	 Young	 cousins	 drop	 in	 and	 out;	 almost	 every	 family	 is	 in	 a
chaotic	state	of	flux.	The	primary	goal	is	to	keep	the	kids	in	school,	away	from	the
gangs,	 alive,	 and	 hopefully	 out	 of	 prison.	 Partner	 guesses	 that	 half	 of	 them	 will
drop	out	anyway	and	most	of	the	boys	will	end	up	in	jail.
He	 says	 he’s	 lucky	 because	 it’s	 just	 him	 and	 his	 mother	 in	 the	 small
apartment.	There	is	a	tiny	spare	bedroom	that	he	uses	as	an	office	for	his	work—
our	work.	Many	of	my	files	and	records	are	stored	there.	I	often	wonder	what	my
clients	 would	 do	 if	 they	 knew	 their	 confidential	 files	 were	 actually	 kept	 in	 Army
surplus	 cabinets	 in	 a	 tenth-floor	 apartment	 in	 a	 government	 housing	 project.	 I
don’t	really	care	because	I	trust	Partner	with	my	life.	He	and	I	have	spent	hours	in
the	little	room	digging	through	police	reports	and	plotting	trial	strategies.
His	 mother,	 Miss	 Luella,	 is	 partially	 disabled	 by	 severe	 diabetes.	 She	 does
some	sewing	for	friends,	keeps	a	spotless	apartment,	and	cooks	occasionally.	Her
primary	job,	as	far	as	I’m	concerned,	is	answering	the	telephone	for	the	Honorable
Sebastian	Rudd,	Attorney-at-Law.	As	I	said,	I’m	not	listed	in	any	phone	book,	but
my	 “office”	 number	 does	 get	 passed	 around.	 In	 fact,	 people	 call	 that	 number	 all
the	 time,	 and	 they	 get	 Miss	 Luella,	 who	 sounds	 as	 crisp	 and	 efficient	 as	 any
receptionist	 sitting	 at	 a	 fine	 desk	 in	 a	 tall	 building	 and	 directing	 calls	 for	 a	 firm
with	hundreds	of	lawyers.
She’ll	say,	“Sebastian	Rudd,	Attorney-at-Law.	How	may	I	direct	your	call?”	As
if	the	firm	has	dozens	of	divisions	and	specialties.	No	caller	ever	gets	me	the	first
time	because	I’m	never	at	the	office.	What	office?	She’ll	say,	“He’s	in	a	meeting,”
or	 “He’s	 in	 a	 deposition,”	 or	 “He’s	 in	 a	 trial,”	 or,	 my	 favorite,	 “He’s	 in	 federal
court.”	Once	she	has	effectively	stiff-armed	the	caller,	she	zeroes	in	on	his	or	her
legal	problem	with	“And	this	is	regarding	what?”
A	divorce.	The	caller	will	get	“I’m	sorry,	but	Mr.	Rudd	does	not	handle	family

matters.”
A	 bankruptcy,	 real	 estate	 closing,	 will,	 deed,	 contract.	 The	 same	 response—
Mr.	Rudd	doesn’t	do	those.
A	 criminal	 matter	 might	 get	 her	 attention	 but	 she	 knows	 that	 most	 lead
nowhere.	So	few	of	the	accused	can	afford	a	fee.	She’ll	lead	the	caller	through	her
standard	questions	to	determine	whether	or	not	they	can	pay.
Someone’s	 been	 injured?	 Now	 we’re	 talking.	 She’ll	 go	 into	 her	 sympathy
mode	 and	 extract	 all	 manner	 of	 information.	 She	 won’t	 let	 them	 off	 the	 phone
until	she’s	picked	them	clean	and	gained	their	trust.	If	the	facts	fall	into	place	and
the	case	shows	real	potential,	she’ll	promise	to	have	Mr.	Rudd	stop	by	the	hospital
that	very	afternoon.
If	the	caller	is	a	judge	or	some	other	important	person,	she	treats	them	with
great	respect,	ends	the	call,	and	immediately	sends	me	a	text	message.	I	pay	her
$500	 a	 month	 in	 cash	 and	 an	 occasional	 bonus	 when	 I	 settle	 a	 good	 car	 wreck.
Partner,	too,	is	paid	in	cash.
Miss	Luella’s	people	were	from	Alabama	and	she	learned	to	cook	the	southern
way.	 At	 least	 twice	 a	 month	 she’ll	 fry	 chicken	 and	 boil	 collards	 and	 bake	 corn
bread	 and	 I’ll	 eat	 until	 I	 can	 hardly	 breathe.	 She	 and	 Partner	 have	 managed	 to
transform	 the	 small,	 cheap,	 mass-produced	 apartment	 into	 a	 home,	 a	 place	 of
warmth.	There	is	a	sadness,	though,	a	cloud	that	hangs	like	a	thick	fog	and	will	not
go	 away.	 Partner	 is	 only	 thirty-eight,	 but	 he	 has	 a	 nineteen-year-old	 son	 at	 Old
Roseburg.	 Jameel	 is	 serving	 ten	 years	 for	 gang-related	 crap,	 and	 he’s	 the	 reason
for	our	visit	today.

10.
After	 we	 do	 the	 paperwork	 and	 get	 patted	 down,	 Partner	 and	 I	 walk	 half	 a
mile	along	sidewalks	lined	with	chain	link	and	razor	wire	to	Camp	D,	a	tough	unit.
We	 go	 through	 security	 again	 and	 deal	 with	 grim-faced	 guards	 who	 would	 like
nothing	better	than	to	turn	us	away.	Because	Partner	is	a	certified	paralegal	and
carries	the	paperwork	to	prove	it,	he	is	allowed	into	the	visiting	wing	with	me.	A
guard	 selects	 a	 consultation	 room	 for	 attorneys	 and	 we	 take	 our	 seats	 facing	 a
screen.
Attorneys	 can	 visit	 anytime,	 with	 notice,	 while	 the	 families	 are	 limited	 to
Sunday	afternoons	only.	As	we	wait,	Partner,	who	says	little,	now	says	even	less.
We	 check	 on	 Jameel	 at	 least	 once	 a	 month,	 and	 the	 visits	 take	 a	 toll	 on	 my
confidant.	 He	 carries	 heavy	 burdens	 because	 he	 blames	 himself	 for	 many	 of	 his
son’s	 problems.	 The	 kid	 was	 headed	 for	 trouble,	 but	 after	 Partner’s	 acquittal	 the
cops	 and	 prosecutors	 were	 out	 for	 revenge.	 Kill	 a	 cop,	 even	 in	 self-defense,	 and
you	make	some	nasty	enemies.	When	Jameel	was	arrested,	there	was	no	room	for
negotiation.	 The	 max	 was	 ten	 years	 and	 the	 prosecutors	 wouldn’t	 budge.	 I
represented	 him,	 pro	 bono	 of	 course,	 but	 there	 was	 nothing	 I	 could	 do.	 He	 was
caught	with	a	backpack	full	of	pot.
“Only	nine	years	to	go,”	Partner	says	softly	as	we	stare	at	the	screen.	“Man	oh
man.	I	lie	awake	at	night	and	wonder	what	he’ll	be	like	in	nine	years.	Twenty-eight
years	 old	 and	 back	 on	 the	 streets.	 No	 job,	 no	 education,	 no	 skills,	 no	 hope,	 no
nothing.	Just	another	convict	looking	for	trouble.”
“Maybe	not,”	I	say	cautiously,	though	I	have	little	to	add.	Partner	knows	this
world	far	better	than	me.	“He’ll	have	a	father	waiting	on	him,	and	a	grandmother.
I’ll	be	around,	I	hope.	Between	the	three	of	us	we’ll	think	of	something.”
“Maybe	 you’ll	 need	 another	 paralegal	 by	 then,”	 he	 says	 with	 a	 rare	 smile,
though	a	brief	one.
“Never	know.”
A	 door	 opens	 on	 the	 other	 side	 and	 Jameel	 walks	 through	 it,	 followed	 by	 a
guard.	The	guard	slowly	unsnaps	the	handcuffs	and	looks	at	us.	“Morning,	Hank,”
I	say.
“Hello,	Rudd,”	he	says.	Hank	is	one	of	the	good	guys,	according	to	Jameel.	I
suppose	it’s	some	sort	of	commentary	on	my	law	practice	that	I’m	on	such	good
terms	with	some	of	the	prison	guards.	Some,	but	certainly	not	all.
“Take	 your	 time,”	 he	 says	 and	 disappears.	 The	 length	 of	 the	 visit	 is
determined	 by	 Hank	 and	 Hank	 alone,	 and	 since	 I’m	 nice	 to	 him	 he	 doesn’t	 care
how	long	we	stay.	I’ve	had	hard-asses	say	things	like	“You	got	one	hour,	max,”	or
“Make	it	quick,”	but	not	Hank.

Jameel	smiles	at	us	and	says,	“Thanks	for	coming.”
“Hello,	son,”	Partner	says	properly.
“Great	to	see	you,	Jameel,”	I	say.
He	 falls	 into	 a	 plastic	 chair.	 The	 kid	 is	 six	 feet	 five,	 skinny,	 and	 seemingly
made	out	of	rubber.	Partner	is	six	two	and	built	like	a	fireplug.	He	says	the	kid’s
mother	is	tall	and	lanky.	She’s	been	out	of	the	picture	for	years,	vanished	into	the
black	hole	of	street	life.	She	has	a	brother	who	played	basketball	at	a	small	college,
and	 Partner	 has	 always	 assumed	 Jameel	 came	 from	 that	 gene	 pool.	 He	 was	 six
three	 in	 the	 ninth	 grade	 and	 scouts	 were	 beginning	 to	 notice.	 At	 some	 point,
though,	he	discovered	pot	and	crack	and	forgot	about	the	game.
“Thanks	for	the	money,”	he	says	to	me.	I	send	him	$100	a	month,	which	he’s
supposed	 to	 use	 for	 canteen	 food	 and	 basics	 such	 as	 pencils,	 paper,	 stamps,	 and
soft	 drinks.	 He	 bought	 a	 fan—Old	 Roseburg	 is	 not	 air-conditioned.	 None	 of	 our
prisons	are.	Partner	sends	him	money	too,	though	I	have	no	idea	how	much.	Two
months	after	he	landed	here,	they	raided	his	cell	and	found	some	pot	hidden	in	his
mattress.	A	snitch	had	squealed,	and	Jameel	spent	two	weeks	in	solitary.	Partner
would	have	choked	him	if	he	could	have	penetrated	the	screen,	but	the	kid	swore	it
would	never	happen	again.
We	talk	about	his	classes.	He’s	taking	remedial	courses	in	an	effort	to	get	his
high	school	equivalent,	but	Partner	is	not	impressed	with	his	progress.	After	a	few
minutes,	 I	 excuse	 myself	 and	 leave	 the	 room.	 Father	 and	 son	 need	 time	 alone,
which	 is	 why	 we’re	 here.	 According	 to	 Partner,	 the	 conversations	 get	 rough	 and
emotional.	He	wants	his	son	to	know	that	his	father	cares	deeply	and	is	watching
from	a	distance.	Old	Roseburg	is	full	of	gangs	and	Jameel	is	easy	prey.	He	swears
he’s	not	involved,	but	Partner	is	skeptical.	Above	all,	he	wants	the	kid	to	be	safe,
and	membership	in	a	gang	is	often	the	best	protection.	It	also	leads	to	warfare	and
revenge	 and	 the	 circle	 of	 violence.	 Seven	 inmates	 were	 killed	 last	 year	 at	 Old
Roseburg.	It	could	be	worse.	Down	the	road	is	a	U.S.	penitentiary,	a	federal	joint,
and	they	average	two	murders	a	month.
I	buy	a	soft	drink	from	a	vending	machine	and	find	a	spot	in	a	row	of	empty
plastic	chairs.	No	other	lawyer	is	visiting	today	and	the	place	is	empty.	I	open	my
briefcase	and	spread	papers	on	a	table	covered	with	old	magazines.	Hank	appears
and	says	hello	again.	We	chat	for	a	few	minutes.	I	ask	how	the	kid	is	doing.
He	 says,	 “All	 right.	 Nothing	 great.	 He’s	 surviving	 and	 he	 hasn’t	 been	 hurt.
He’s	been	here	a	year	and	knows	his	way	around.	Doesn’t	want	to	work,	though.	I
got	him	a	job	in	the	laundry	and	he	lasted	a	week.	Goes	to	most	of	his	classes,	but
not	all	of	them.”
“A	gang?”
“Don’t	know,	but	I’m	watching.”
Another	guard	enters	through	a	door	far	away	and	Hank	suddenly	has	to	go.

He	can’t	be	seen	fraternizing	with	a	lowly	criminal	defense	lawyer.	I	try	and	read	a
thick	brief,	but	it’s	too	boring.	I	walk	to	a	window	that	looks	out	upon	a	vast	yard
lined	 with	 double	 rows	 of	 chain	 link.	 Hundreds	 of	 inmates,	 all	 in	 prison	 whites,
are	killing	time	as	guards	look	down	from	a	tower.
Young	and	black,	almost	all	of	them.	According	to	the	numbers,	they’re	in	for
nonviolent	 drug	 offenses.	 The	 average	 sentence	 is	 seven	 years.	 Upon	 release,	 60
percent	will	be	back	here	within	three	years.
And	 why	 not?	 What’s	 on	 the	 outside	 to	 prevent	 their	 return?	 They	 are	 now
convicted	 felons,	 a	 branding	 they	 will	 never	 be	 able	 to	 shake.	 The	 odds	 were
stacked	against	them	to	begin	with,	and	now	that	they’re	tagged	as	felons,	life	in
the	free	world	is	somehow	supposed	to	improve?	These	are	the	real	casualties	of
our	wars.	The	war	on	drugs.	The	war	on	crime.	Unintended	victims	of	tough	laws
passed	by	tough	politicians	over	the	past	forty	years.	One	million	young	black	men
now	warehoused	in	decaying	prisons,	idling	away	the	days	at	taxpayer	expense.
Our	prisons	are	packed.	Our	streets	are	filled	with	drugs.	Who’s	winning	the
war?
We’ve	lost	our	minds.

11.
After	 two	 hours,	 Hank	 says	 it’s	 time	 to	 wrap	 things	 up.	 I	 knock	 and	 reenter
the	room,	an	unventilated	little	box	that’s	always	stuffy.	Jameel	sits	with	his	arms
crossed,	his	eyes	on	the	floor.	Partner	sits	with	his	arms	crossed	too,	staring	at	the
screen,	 and	 I	 get	 the	 feeling	 that,	 though	 much	 has	 been	 said,	 no	 words	 have
passed	in	some	time.	I	say,	“We	gotta	go.”
This	 is	 what	 both	 want	 to	 hear.	 They	 manage	 to	 say	 good-bye	 with	 some
fondness.	 Jameel	 thanks	 us	 for	 coming,	 passes	 along	 greetings	 and	 love	 to	 Miss
Luella,	and	stands	as	Hank	enters	the	room	from	behind	him.
Driving	away,	Partner	says	nothing	for	an	hour.

12.
Link	Scanlon	is	not	my	first	mobster.	That	honor	goes	to	a	sensational	crook
named	Dewey	Knutt,	a	man	I	do	not	visit	in	prison.	While	Link	relished	the	blood,
broken	bones,	intimidation,	and	notoriety,	Dewey	went	about	his	life	of	crime	as
quietly	 as	 possible.	 While	 Link	 dreamed	 of	 being	 a	 Mafia	 don	 from	 childhood,
Dewey	 was	 actually	 an	 honest	 furniture	 salesman	 who	 didn’t	 break	 bad	 until	 he
was	 in	 his	 mid-thirties.	 While	 Link’s	 net	 worth	 was	 substantial	 but	 largely
untraceable,	a	business	magazine	claimed	Dewey	was	worth	$300	million	before
his	 troubles.	 They	 sent	 Link	 to	 death	 row;	 Dewey	 got	 forty	 years	 in	 a	 federal
slammer.	 Link	 managed	 to	 escape;	 Dewey	 has	 hair	 down	 to	 his	 waist	 and	 grows
organic	herbs	and	vegetables	in	a	prison	garden.
Dewey	Knutt	was	a	fast-talking	salesman	who	moved	a	ton	of	cheap	furniture,
and	with	his	earnings	he	bought	a	rental	house.	Then	another,	then	several	more.
He	 learned	 the	 trick	 of	 using	 other	 people’s	 money	 and	 acquired	 a	 prodigious
appetite	for	risk.	He	parlayed	his	properties	and	loans	into	shopping	centers	and
subdivisions.	During	a	short	recession,	a	bank	said	no	to	a	loan,	so	he	bought	the
bank	and	fired	all	the	suits	who	worked	there.	He	memorized	banking	regulations
and	found	all	of	the	gaping	loopholes.	During	a	longer	recession,	he	picked	up	a
few	 more	 banks	 and	 some	 regional	 mortgage	 companies.	 Money	 was	 cheap	 and
Dewey	 Knutt	 proved	 to	 be	 a	 master	 at	 the	 borrowing	 game.	 His	 downfall,	 as	 we
later	learned,	began	with	his	penchant	for	double-	and	even	triple-collateralizing
assets.	A	visionary	in	the	world	of	shady	profits,	he	was	one	of	the	first	to	churn
the	 fertile	 fields	 of	 subprime	 mortgages.	 He	 fine-tuned	 the	 intricacies	 of	 loansharking.	 He	 became	 a	 skilled	 briber	 of	 politicians	 and	 regulators.	 Add	 tax
evasion,	money	laundering,	mail	fraud,	insider	trading,	and	the	outright	looting	of
pension	funds,	and	Dewey	richly	deserved	his	forty	years.
Those	still	searching	for	hidden	remnants	of	his	fortune	include	an	entire	cast
of	present	and	former	enemies,	some	banking	regulators,	at	least	two	bankruptcy
courts,	his	ex-wife’s	lawyers,	and	several	branches	of	the	federal	government.	So
far,	they’ve	found	nothing.
When	Dewey	was	forty-nine,	his	shiftless	son,	Alan,	was	caught	with	a	trunk
load	of	cocaine.	Alan	was	twenty,	a	real	mess	of	a	kid,	and	was	trying	to	impress
his	 father	 with	 his	 own	 style	 of	 entrepreneurship.	 Dewey	 was	 so	 incensed	 and
embarrassed	that	he	refused	to	hire	a	lawyer	for	Alan.	A	friend	referred	him	to	me.
I	 took	 one	 look	 at	 the	 seizure	 and	 realized	 the	 cops	 had	 blown	 it.	 They’d	 had	 no
warrant	and	no	probable	cause	to	search	the	car.	It	was	cut-and-dried,	black-andwhite.	 I	 filed	 the	 proper	 motions	 and	 briefs	 and	 the	 City	 halfheartedly	 contested
the	 issue.	 The	 cocaine	 bust	 was	 ruled	 unconstitutional,	 the	 evidence	 was	 thrown
out,	and	all	charges	against	Alan	were	dismissed.	It	was	a	big	story	for	a	few	days
and	I	got	my	picture	in	the	papers	for	the	first	time.

Dewey	used	his	favorite	lawyers	for	his	heavy	work,	but	he	was	so	impressed
with	 my	 slick	 maneuvers	 he	 decided	 to	 throw	 me	 a	 few	 scraps.	 Most	 of	 it	 was
outside	the	scope	of	my	expertise,	but	one	case	intrigued	me	and	I	signed	on.
Dewey	loved	golf	but	had	a	hard	time	working	it	into	his	frenetic	schedule.	In
addition,	 he	 had	 little	 patience	 for	 the	 staid	 traditions	 of	 most	 golf	 and	 country
clubs,	 few	 of	 which,	 if	 any,	 would	 consider	 such	 an	 outlaw	 as	 a	 member.	 He
became	 obsessed	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 building	 his	 own	 course	 and	 lighting	 it	 so	 he
could	 play	 at	 night,	 either	 alone	 or	 with	 a	 few	 pals.	 At	 the	 time,	 there	 were	 only
three	other	lit	courses	in	the	entire	country,	and	none	within	a	thousand	miles	of
here.	Eighteen	holes,	all	private,	under	lights—the	ultimate	rich	boy’s	toy.	To	avoid
the	City’s	zoning	Nazis,	he	selected	two	hundred	acres	a	mile	from	the	city	limits.
The	county	objected.	The	neighbors	sued.	I	handled	the	legal	work	and	eventually
won	approval.	More	headlines.
However,	 the	 real	 notoriety	 was	 just	 around	 the	 corner.	 A	 housing	 bubble
popped.	Interest	rates	spiked.	A	perfect	storm	blew	in	and	Dewey	couldn’t	borrow
fast	 enough.	 His	 house	 of	 cards	 collapsed	 in	 spectacular	 fashion.	 With	 flawless
timing,	the	FBI,	IRS,	SEC,	and	a	trainload	of	other	tough	guys	with	badges	arrived
on	 the	 scene,	 all	 waving	 warrants.	 The	 indictment	 was	 an	 inch	 thick	 and	 loaded
with	 brutal	 allegations	 against	 Dewey,	 the	 obvious	 target.	 It	 also	 alleged	 grand
conspiracies	involving	his	bankers,	accountants,	partners,	lawyers,	a	stockbroker,
and	 two	 city	 councilmen.	 It	 detailed,	 in	 very	 convincing	 narratives,	 dozens	 of
violations	 under	 the	 Racketeer	 Influenced	 and	 Corrupt	 Organizations	 Act.	 RICO
for	short,	the	greatest	gift	Congress	has	ever	bestowed	upon	federal	prosecutors.
I	 was	 investigated	 and	 became	 convinced	 I	 would	 be	 indicted	 too,	 though	 I
had	done	nothing	wrong.	Thankfully,	I	had	managed	to	remain	on	the	fringes.	For
a	while	it	seemed	to	be	a	shoot-now-and-ask-questions-later	inquisition.	But	the
Feds	backed	off	and	lost	interest	in	me.	They	had	much	bigger	crooks	to	nail.
Alan	was	indicted,	basically	for	being	Dewey’s	son.	When	the	FBI	threatened
to	 indict	 Dewey’s	 daughter,	 he	 caved	 and	 agreed	 to	 a	 forty-year	 deal.	 The	 bogus
charges	against	his	kids	were	dismissed,	and	most	of	his	co-indictees	pled	to	light
sentences.	All	avoided	serious	jail	time.	In	short,	Dewey	did	the	honorable	thing
and	took	a	mighty	fall.
He	 was	 building	 his	 golf	 course—grandly	 named	 the	 Old	 Plantation—just	 as
the	Feds	moved	in.	All	the	money	vanished	in	a	matter	of	weeks	and	construction
stopped—after	the	fourteenth	green.
Today,	it	is	the	only	fourteen-hole	course	with	lights	in	the	entire	world,	as	far
as	anyone	knows.	In	honor	of	Dewey,	it’s	called	Old	Rico.	Its	membership	consists
solely	 of	 his	 cronies	 and	 conspirators.	 Alan’s	 job	 these	 days	 is	 taking	 care	 of	 the
course	and	keeping	it	playable,	which	he	manages	to	do.	He	plays	nonstop	himself
and	 dreams	 of	 becoming	 a	 pro.	 He	 collects	 enough	 in	 dues	 to	 hire	 a	 few
groundskeepers,	 all	 undocumented	 workers,	 plus	 we	 suspect	 he	 knows	 where
some	 of	 Dewey’s	 old	 loot	 is	 buried.	 I	 pay	 $5,000	 a	 year	 and	 it’s	 worth	 it	 just	 to

avoid	 the	 crowds.	 The	 greens	 and	 tee	 boxes	 are	 usually	 in	 good	 shape.	 The
fairways	 can	 get	 rough,	 but	 no	 one	 cares.	 If	 we	 wanted	 a	 manicured	 course	 we
would	 join	 a	 real	 club,	 though	 none	 of	 us	 at	 Old	 Rico	 could	 survive	 the	 vetting
process.
Every	Wednesday	night	at	seven	o’clock	we	gather	for	Dirty	Golf,	a	game	that
bears	 little	 resemblance	 to	 what	 you	 might	 see	 on	 CBS.	 Dewey’s	 original	 plans
were	to	build	the	course	first,	so	he	would	have	a	place	to	play,	and	then	build	the
clubhouse,	so	he	would	have	a	place	to	drink.	Absent	a	proper	clubhouse,	we	meet
for	 pregame	 drinks	 and	 wagering	 in	 a	 converted	 tractor	 barn	 where	 Dewey	 once
enjoyed	cockfighting,	perhaps	the	only	crime	not	covered	by	his	indictment.	Alan
lives	 upstairs	 with	 two	 women,	 neither	 his	 wife,	 and	 he’s	 the	 organizer	 of	 Dirty
Golf.	The	two	gals	work	the	bar,	absorb	the	crudities,	and	banter	with	the	crowd.
The	 rituals	 call	 for	 the	 first	 pint—in	 fruit	 jars—to	 be	 lifted	 in	 a	 toast	 to	 Dewey,
who’s	smiling	down	from	a	bad	portrait	above	the	bar.	Tonight	there	are	eleven	of
us,	a	workable	number	since	Old	Rico	has	only	twelve	golf	carts.	As	we	drain	the
first	 pints,	 Alan	 goes	 through	 the	 rather	 raucous	 chore	 of	 bracketing	 the
tournament,	establishing	handicaps,	and	collecting	money.	Dirty	Golf	costs	$200
each,	winner	take	all,	not	a	bad	pot	but	I’ve	never	won	it.
Winning	 takes	 skill,	 of	 course,	 but	 also	 a	 higher	 handicap	 and	 the	 ability	 to
cheat	without	getting	caught.	The	rules	are	flexible.	For	example,	a	bad	shot	that
goes	 outside	 the	 fairway	 boundaries	 is	 always	 in	 play	 if	 it	 can	 be	 found.	 There’s
really	no	such	thing	as	out-of-bounds	at	Old	Rico.	If	you	find	it,	play	it.	A	putt	of
three	feet	or	less	is	always	conceded,	unless	an	opponent	is	having	a	bad	night	and
wants	to	play	hard-ass.	Every	player	has	the	right	to	require	another	player	to	putt
everything.	A	foursome	can	agree	that	each	guy	can	take	a	mulligan,	or	a	free	shot
in	the	aftermath	of	a	bad	one.	And,	if	all	four	are	in	the	right	mood,	each	can	take
one	 mullie	 on	 the	 front	 seven	 and	 another	 on	 the	 back.	 Needless	 to	 say,	 the
sponginess	of	the	rules	leads	to	disagreement	and	conflict.	Since	not	one	golfer	in
ten	knows	the	real	rules	anyway,	each	round	of	Dirty	Golf	is	loaded	with	incessant
carping,	bitching,	complaining,	and	even	threats.
Partner	drives	my	golf	cart	and	I’m	not	the	only	one	here	with	a	bodyguard.
Since	 I	 play	 alone,	 tonight	 I’m	 paired	 up	 with	 Toby	 Chalk,	 a	 former	 city
councilman	who	served	four	months	in	the	wake	of	Dewey’s	demise.	He	drives	his
own	golf	cart.	Caddies	are	forbidden	at	Old	Rico.
After	 an	 hour	 of	 drinking	 and	 preliminaries,	 we	 head	 for	 the	 course.	 It’s
getting	dark,	the	lights	are	on,	and	we	do	indeed	feel	privileged	to	be	playing	golf
at	night.	It’s	a	shotgun	start.	Toby	and	I	are	assigned	the	fifth	tee,	and	when	Alan
yells	 “Go”	 we	 race	 away,	 carts	 bouncing,	 clubs	 rattling	 and	 jangling,	 grown	 men
half-drunk	and	puffing	on	big	cigars,	whooping	and	yelling	happily	into	the	night.
Partner	grins	and	shakes	his	head.	Crazy	white	men.

PART	THREE

WARRIOR	COPS

1.
Here’s	what	happened:
My	clients,	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Douglas	Renfro,	Doug	and	Kitty	to	everyone,	lived
for	thirty	quiet	and	happy	years	on	a	shady	street	in	a	nice	suburb.	They	were	good
neighbors,	 active	 in	 local	 charities	 and	 the	 church,	 always	 ready	 to	 lend	 a	 hand.
They	 were	 in	 their	 early	 seventies,	 retired,	 with	 kids	 and	 grandkids,	 a	 couple	 of
dogs,	and	a	time-share	in	Florida.	They	owed	no	money	and	paid	off	their	credit
cards	in	full	each	month.	They	were	comfortable	and	reasonably	healthy,	though
Doug	 was	 dealing	 with	 atrial	 fibrillation	 and	 Kitty	 was	 rebounding	 from	 breast
cancer.	He	had	spent	fourteen	years	in	the	Army,	then	sold	medical	devices	for	the
rest	 of	 his	 career.	 She	 had	 adjusted	 claims	 for	 an	 insurance	 company.	 To	 stay
busy,	she	volunteered	at	a	hospital	while	he	puttered	in	the	flower	beds	and	played
tennis	 at	 a	 city	 park.	 At	 the	 insistence	 of	 their	 children	 and	 grandchildren,	 the
Renfros	had	reluctantly	bought	his-and-her	laptops	and	joined	the	digital	world,
though	they	spent	little	time	online.
The	house	next	door	to	them	had	been	bought	and	sold	a	dozen	times	over	the
years,	and	the	current	owners	were	oddballs	who	kept	to	themselves.	They	had	a
teenage	son,	Lance,	a	misfit	who	spent	most	of	his	time	locked	in	his	room	playing
video	 games	 and	 peddling	 drugs	 through	 the	 Internet.	 To	 hide	 his	 habits,	 he
routinely	 piggybacked	 on	 the	 Renfros’	 wireless	 router.	 They,	 of	 course,	 did	 not
know	 this.	 They	 knew	 how	 to	 turn	 their	 laptops	 on	 and	 off,	 send	 and	 receive	 emails,	do	basic	shopping,	and	check	the	weather,	but	beyond	that	they	had	no	idea
how	the	technology	worked	and	had	little	interest	in	it.	They	did	not	bother	with
passwords	or	security	of	any	kind.
The	 state	 police	 initiated	 a	 sting	 operation	 to	 crack	 down	 on	 Internet	 drug
trafficking	and	tracked	an	IP	address	to	the	Renfros’	home.	Someone	in	there	was
buying	 and	 selling	 a	 lot	 of	 Ecstasy,	 and	 the	 decision	 was	 made	 to	 launch	 a	 fullscale	 SWAT	 team	 assault.	 Warrants—one	 to	 search	 the	 house	 and	 one	 to	 arrest
Doug	Renfro—were	obtained,	and	at	3:00	on	a	quiet,	starlit	night	a	team	of	eight
city	 policemen	 rushed	 through	 the	 darkness	 and	 surrounded	 the	 Renfro	 home.
Eight	 officers—all	 in	 full	 combat	 gear	 with	 Kevlar	 vests,	 camouflage	 uniforms,
panzer-style	helmets,	night-vision	goggles,	tactical	radios,	semiautomatic	pistols,
assault	 rifles,	 knee	 pads,	 some	 even	 with	 face	 masks,	 and	 a	 few	 even	 with	 black
face	 paint	 for	 maximum	 drama—ducked	 and	 squatted	 and	 moved	 fearlessly
through	the	Renfros’	flower	beds,	their	itchy	fingers	eager	for	combat.	Two	carried
flash-bang	stun	grenades	and	two	carried	battering	rams.
Warrior	 cops.	 The	 vast	 majority,	 as	 we	 would	 later	 learn,	 were	 woefully
untrained,	 but	 all	 were	 thrilled	 to	 be	 in	 battle.	 At	 least	 six	 later	 admitted	 to
consuming	highly	caffeinated	energy	drinks	to	stay	awake	at	that	awful	hour.

Instead	of	simply	ringing	the	doorbell	and	waking	the	Renfros	and	explaining
that	they,	the	police,	wanted	to	talk	and	search	the	house,	the	cops	launched	the
assault	 with	 a	 bang	 by	 kicking	 in	 the	 front	 and	 rear	 doors	 simultaneously.	 They
would	later	lie	and	claim	they	had	called	out	to	the	occupants,	but	Doug	and	Kitty
were	 sound	 asleep,	 as	 you	 would	 expect.	 They	 heard	 nothing	 until	 the	 invasion
began.
What	 happened	 in	 the	 next	 sixty	 seconds	 took	 months	 to	 unravel	 and	 get
straight.	 The	 first	 casualty	 was	 Spike,	 the	 yellow	 Lab	 who	 slept	 on	 the	 kitchen
floor.	Spike	was	twelve,	old	for	a	Lab,	and	hard	of	hearing.	But	he	certainly	heard
the	door	crash	just	a	few	feet	away.	His	mistake	was	to	jump	up	and	start	barking,
at	which	time	he	was	shot	three	times	by	a	9-millimeter	semiautomatic	pistol.	By
then	 Doug	 Renfro	 was	 scrambling	 out	 of	 bed	 and	 reaching	 for	 his	 own	 gun,	 one
properly	registered	and	kept	in	a	drawer	for	protection.	He	also	owned	a	Browning
12-gauge	shotgun	he	used	twice	a	year	to	hunt	geese,	but	it	was	tucked	away	in	a
closet.
In	 attempting	 to	 defend	 the	 home	 invasion,	 our	 bumbling	 chief	 of	 police
would	later	claim	that	the	SWAT	assault	was	necessary	because	they	knew	Doug
Renfro	was	heavily	armed.
Doug	had	made	it	to	the	hallway,	when	he	saw	several	dark	figures	swarming
up	 the	 stairs.	 An	 Army	 veteran,	 he	 hit	 the	 floor	 and	 began	 firing	 away.	 Fire	 was
returned.	The	gun	battle	was	brief	and	deadly.	Doug	was	shot	twice,	in	the	forearm
and	 shoulder.	 A	 cop	 named	 Keestler	 was	 hit	 in	 the	 neck,	 presumably	 by	 Doug.
Kitty,	who	had	rushed	in	a	panic	out	of	the	bedroom	behind	her	husband,	was	shot
three	 times	 in	 the	 face	 and	 four	 times	 in	 the	 chest	 and	 died	 at	 the	 scene.	 Their
other	dog,	a	schnauzer	who	slept	with	them,	was	also	shot	and	killed.
Doug	Renfro	and	Keestler	were	rushed	to	the	hospital.	Kitty	was	taken	to	the
city	morgue.	Neighbors	gawked	in	disbelief	as	their	street	was	lit	by	flashing	lights
while	ambulances	rushed	away	with	the	casualties.
The	 police	 stayed	 at	 the	 home	 for	 hours	 and	 collected	 all	 possible	 evidence,
including	 the	 laptops.	 Within	 two	 hours,	 before	 sunrise,	 they	 knew	 the	 Renfros’
computers	 had	 never	 been	 used	 to	 peddle	 drugs.	 They	 knew	 they	 had	 made	 a
mistake,	 but	 coming	 clean	 is	 simply	 not	 in	 their	 playbook.	 The	 cover-up	 began
immediately	when	the	commander	of	the	SWAT	team	gravely	informed	television
reporters	 on	 the	 scene	 that	 the	 occupants	 of	 the	 home	 were	 suspected	 of
trafficking	 in	 drugs	 and	 that	 the	 man	 of	 the	 house,	 a	 Mr.	 Doug	 Renfro,	 had
attempted	to	kill	several	officers.
After	his	recovery	from	surgery,	six	hours	after	getting	shot,	Doug	was	told	of
his	 wife’s	 death.	 He	 was	 also	 informed	 that	 the	 invaders	 were	 actually	 police
officers.	 He	 had	 no	 idea.	 He	 thought	 they	 were	 armed	 criminals	 invading	 his
home.

2.
My	cell	phone	rings	at	6:45.	I’m	staring	at	an	impossible	bank	shot	to	sink	the
9	 ball	 in	 a	 corner	 pocket	 and	 run	 the	 table.	 I’ve	 been	 drinking	 strong	 coffee	 and
missing	 too	 many	 shots	 for	 the	 past	 hour.	 I	 grab	 the	 phone,	 look	 at	 the	 ID,	 and
say,	“Good	morning.”
“Are	you	awake?”	Partner	asks.
“Guess.”	I	haven’t	been	asleep	at	6:45	in	years.	Neither	has	Partner.
“Might	want	to	flip	on	the	news.”
“Okay,	what’s	up?”
“Looks	like	our	toy	soldiers	just	botched	another	home	invasion.	Casualties.”
“Shit!”	I	say	and	grab	the	remote.	“Later.”	Wedged	into	one	corner	of	my	den
is	 a	 small	 sofa	 and	 a	 chair.	 A	 wide-screen	 HD	 television	 hangs	 from	 the	 ceiling
against	a	wall.	I	fall	into	the	chair	just	as	the	first	image	appears.
The	 sun	 is	 barely	 up	 but	 there’s	 enough	 light	 to	 capture	 the	 mayhem.	 The
Renfros’	 front	 yard	 is	 swarming	 with	 cops	 and	 rescue	 personnel.	 Lights	 flash	 in
the	 background	 behind	 the	 breathless	 and	 stuttering	 reporter.	 Neighbors	 in
bathrobes	 gawk	 from	 across	 the	 street.	 Bright	 yellow	 police	 crime	 scene	 tape	 is
strung	 high	 and	 low	 and	 in	 all	 directions.	 It’s	 a	 crime	 scene	 all	 right,	 but	 I’m
already	suspicious.	Who	are	the	real	criminals?	I	call	Partner,	tell	him	to	get	to	the
hospital	and	start	snooping.
Sitting	 in	 the	 Renfros’	 driveway	 is	 a	 tank,	 with	 an	 eight-inch	 barrel,	 thick
rubber	tires	instead	of	treads,	a	camouflage	paint	job,	and	an	open	turret	where,	at
the	moment,	a	warrior	cop	is	sitting,	his	face	hidden	behind	biker	sunglasses,	his
expression	one	of	extreme	readiness.	The	City’s	police	department	owns	only	one
tank	and	they’re	proud	of	it.	They	use	it	whenever	possible.	I	know	this	tank;	I’ve
dealt	with	it	before.
Several	years	ago,	not	long	after	the	terror	attacks	on	September	11,	our	police
department	 managed	 to	 bilk	 Homeland	 Security	 out	 of	 a	 few	 million	 bucks	 so	 it
could	arm	up	and	join	the	national	craze	of	ETF—Extreme	Terror	Fighting.	Never
mind	that	our	city	is	far	away	from	the	major	metropolitan	areas,	or	that	there	has
been	absolutely	no	sign	of	any	jihadists	around	here,	or	that	our	cops	already	had
plenty	of	guns	and	ninja	gear.	Forget	all	that—we	had	to	be	ready!	So	in	the	arms
race	that	followed,	our	cops	somehow	got	a	new	tank.	And	once	they	learned	how
to	drive	it,	then,	hell,	it	was	time	to	use	it.
The	first	victim	was	a	rather	rustic	old	boy	named	Sonny	Werth	who	lived	at
the	edge	of	the	city	limits	in	a	part	of	town	that	realtors	tend	to	avoid.	Sonny,	his
girlfriend,	 and	 a	 couple	 of	 her	 kids	 were	 asleep	 at	 2:00	 a.m.	 when	 the	 house

seemed	 to	 explode.	 It	 wasn’t	 much	 of	 a	 house,	 but	 that	 really	 didn’t	 matter.	 The
walls	shook,	there	was	a	roar,	and	Sonny	at	first	thought	a	tornado	had	hit.
No,	only	the	police.	They	would	later	claim	that	they	had	knocked	on	the	door
and	tried	the	doorbell,	but	no	one	inside	the	house	heard	anything	until	the	tank
plowed	through	the	front	window	and	stopped	in	the	den.	A	mixed	spaniel	mutt
tried	to	escape	through	the	gaping	hole	but	was	gunned	down	by	a	brave	warrior.
Luckily,	 there	 were	 no	 other	 casualties,	 though	 Sonny	 spent	 two	 nights	 in	 the
hospital	with	chest	pain,	after	which	he	went	to	jail	for	a	week	before	he	could	post
bond.	 His	 crimes:	 bookmaking,	 gambling.	 The	 cops	 and	 prosecutors	 claimed
Sonny	was	part	of	a	ring,	thus	a	conspirator,	thus	a	member	of	organized	crime,
and	so	on.
On	 Sonny’s	 behalf,	 I	 sued	 the	 City	 for	 “excessive	 force”	 and	 got	 a	 million
bucks.	Not	one	dime	of	which,	by	the	way,	came	out	of	the	pockets	of	the	cops	who
planned	 the	 raid.	 As	 always,	 it	 came	 from	 the	 taxpayers.	 The	 criminal	 charges
against	 Sonny	 were	 later	 dismissed,	 so	 the	 raid	 was	 a	 complete	 waste	 of	 time,
money,	and	energy.
As	I	sip	my	coffee	and	watch	the	scene,	I	think	to	myself	that	the	Renfros	were
lucky	in	that	the	tank	was	not	used	to	bust	up	their	house.	For	reasons	we’ll	never
know,	the	decision	was	made	to	keep	it	in	the	driveway,	just	in	case.	If	the	eight
soldiers	were	not	enough,	if	the	Renfros	had	somehow	managed	a	counterattack,
then	the	tank	would	have	been	sent	in	to	destroy	the	den.
The	 camera	 closes	 in	 on	 two	 cops	 standing	 beside	 the	 tank,	 each	 with	 an
assault	rifle.	Both	weigh	over	three	hundred	pounds.	One	is	wearing	a	uniform	of
green-and-gray	camouflage,	as	if	he	were	hunting	deer	in	the	woods.	The	other	is
wearing	 a	 uniform	 of	 brown-and-beige	 camouflage,	 as	 if	 he	 were	 hunting
insurgents	 in	 the	 desert.	 These	 two	 clowns	 are	 standing	 in	 the	 driveway	 of	 a
suburban	home,	about	fifteen	minutes	from	downtown,	in	a	well-developed	city	of
a	million	people,	and	they’re	wearing	camouflage.	The	sad	and	scary	thing	about
this	 image	 is	 that	 these	 guys	 have	 no	 idea	 how	 stupid	 they	 look.	 Instead,	 they’re
proud,	 arrogant.	 They’re	 on	 display,	 tough	 guys	 fighting	 bad	 guys.	 One	 of	 their
brethren	has	been	hit,	wounded,	fallen	in	the	line	of	duty,	and	they’re	pissed	about
it.	They	scowl	at	the	neighbors	across	the	street.	One	wrong	word,	and	they	might
start	shooting.	Their	fingers	are	on	the	triggers.
The	weather	comes	on	and	I	go	to	the	shower.
Partner	picks	me	up	at	eight	and	we	head	to	the	hospital.	Doug	Renfro	is	still
in	 surgery.	 Officer	 Keestler’s	 wounds	 are	 not	 life	 threatening.	 There	 are	 cops
everywhere.	 In	 a	 crowded	 waiting	 room,	 Partner	 points	 to	 a	 huddle	 of	 stunned
people,	all	sitting	knee	to	knee	and	holding	hands.
Not	for	the	first	time,	I	ask	myself	the	obvious	question:	Why	didn’t	the	cops
simply	ring	the	doorbell	at	a	decent	hour	and	have	a	chat	with	Mr.	Renfro?	Two
cops	 in	 plain	 clothes,	 or	 maybe	 just	 one	 in	 a	 uniform?	 Why	 not?	 The	 answer	 is

simple:	 These	 guys	 think	 they’re	 part	 of	 an	 extreme,	 elite	 force,	 and	 they	 need
their	thrills,	so	here	we	are	in	another	frantic	hospital	with	casualties.
Thomas	Renfro	is	about	forty.	According	to	Partner,	he’s	an	optometrist	out
in	 the	 suburbs.	 His	 two	 sisters	 do	 not	 live	 around	 here	 and	 are	 not	 yet	 at	 the
hospital.	 I	 swallow	 hard	 and	 approach	 him.	 He	 wants	 to	 wave	 me	 off,	 but	 I	 say
over	and	over	it’s	important	that	we	talk.	He	finally	steps	away	and	we	find	privacy
in	a	corner.	The	poor	guy	is	waiting	on	his	sisters	so	they	can	go	to	the	morgue	and
start	arranging	things	for	their	dead	mother;	meanwhile,	their	father	is	in	surgery.
I	 apologize	 for	 intruding	 but	 get	 his	 attention	 when	 I	 explain	 that	 I’ve	 been
through	this	before	with	these	cops.
He	wipes	his	red	eyes	and	says,	“I	think	I’ve	seen	you	before.”
“Probably	on	the	news.	I	take	some	crazy	cases.”
He	hesitates,	then,	“What	kinda	case	is	this?”
“Here’s	 what	 will	 happen,	 Mr.	 Renfro.	 Your	 father	 is	 not	 coming	 home
anytime	soon.	When	the	doctors	are	finished	with	him,	the	cops	will	take	him	to
jail.	He’ll	be	charged	with	the	attempted	murder	of	a	police	officer.	Carries	a	max
of	 twenty	 years.	 His	 bond	 will	 be	 set	 at	 a	 million	 bucks	 or	 so,	 something
outrageous,	and	he	won’t	be	able	to	make	it	because	the	prosecutor	will	freeze	his
assets.	 House,	 bank	 accounts,	 whatever.	 He	 can’t	 touch	 anything	 because	 this	 is
how	they	rig	prosecutions.”
As	if	this	poor	guy	hasn’t	been	hit	with	enough	crap	in	the	past	five	hours.	He
closes	 his	 eyes	 and	 shakes	 his	 head,	 but	 he’s	 listening.	 I	 go	 on:	 “The	 reason	 I’m
bothering	 you	 with	 this	 is	 that	 it’s	 important	 to	 file	 a	 civil	 lawsuit	 immediately.
Tomorrow	 if	 possible.	 Wrongful	 death	 of	 your	 mother,	 assault	 on	 your	 father,
excessive	 force,	 police	 incompetence,	 violation	 of	 rights,	 et	 cetera.	 I’ll	 throw
everything	 at	 them.	 I’ve	 done	 it	 before.	 If	 we	 get	 the	 right	 judge,	 then	 I’ll	 have
access	to	their	internal	records	right	off	the	bat.	They’re	covering	up	their	mistakes
as	we	speak,	and	they’re	very	good	at	it.”
He	breaks	down,	fights	it,	gets	some	control,	and	says,	“This	is	too	much.”
I	hand	him	a	card	and	say,	“I	understand.	Call	me	as	soon	as	you	can.	I	fight
these	bastards	all	the	time	and	I	know	the	game.	You’re	going	through	hell	now,
but,	unfortunately,	it	will	only	get	worse.”
He	manages	to	say	“Thanks.”

3.
Later	 that	 afternoon,	 the	 police	 stop	 by	 and	 have	 a	 chat	 with	 Lance,	 the
shiftless	 kid	 next	 door	 to	 the	 Renfros.	 Just	 three	 cops,	 in	 plain	 clothes,	 bravely
approaching	the	house	without	assault	weapons	or	bulletproof	vests.	They	didn’t
even	bring	their	tank.	Things	go	smoothly;	no	one	gets	shot.
Lance	 is	 nineteen,	 unemployed,	 home	 alone,	 a	 real	 loser,	 and	 his	 world	 is
about	 to	 change	 dramatically.	 The	 police	 have	 a	 search	 warrant.	 After	 they	 grab
his	laptop	and	cell	phone,	Lance	starts	talking.	He’s	in	the	den	when	his	mother
comes	 home,	 and	 he’s	 admitting	 everything.	 He’s	 been	 piggybacking	 on	 the
Renfros’	 Wi-Fi	 system	 for	 about	 a	 year.	 He	 trades	 on	 the	 Dark	 Web,	 on	 a	 site
called	 Millie’s	 Market,	 where	 he	 can	 buy	 any	 quantity	 of	 any	 drug,	 illegal	 or
prescription.	 He	 sticks	 to	 Ecstasy	 because	 it’s	 accessible	 and	 the	 kids,	 his
customers,	 love	 it.	 He	 does	 his	 business	 in	 Bitcoin,	 current	 balance	 valued	 at
$60,000.	All	the	details	pour	out	in	a	torrent,	and	after	an	hour	he’s	led	away	in
handcuffs.
So	at	5:00	p.m.,	or	about	fourteen	hours	after	the	raid,	the	police	finally	know
the	truth.	But	their	cover-up	is	already	in	play.	They	leak	some	lies	here	and	there,
and	 early	 the	 next	 morning	 I’m	 reading	 the	 Chronicle	 online	 and	 see	 the	 frontpage	news.	There	are	photos	of	Douglas	and	Katherine	Renfro,	she	now	deceased,
and	Officer	Keestler.	He	sounds	like	a	hero;	the	Renfros	sound	like	outlaws.	Doug
is	a	suspect	in	an	Internet	drug-trafficking	ring.	Shocking,	a	neighbor	says.	Had	no
idea.	 The	 nicest	 people.	 Kitty	 just	 got	 caught	 in	 the	 cross	 fire	 when	 her	 husband
fired	 upon	 peace-loving	 officers	 of	 the	 law.	 She’ll	 be	 buried	 next	 week.	 He’ll	 be
indicted	 shortly.	 Keestler	 is	 expected	 to	 survive.	 There’s	 not	 one	 word	 about
Lance.
Two	hours	later,	I	meet	Nate	Spurio	at	a	bagel	shop	in	a	strip	mall	north	of
town.	We	can’t	be	seen	in	public,	or	at	least	identified	by	anyone	who	might	be	a
cop	or	know	a	cop,	so	we	alternate	our	secret	meetings	between	A,	B,	C,	and	D.	A
is	an	Arby’s	roast	beef	joint	in	the	suburbs.	B	is	one	of	two	bagel	shops.	C	is	the
dreadful	Catfish	Cave,	six	miles	east	of	the	City.	D	is	for	a	donut	shop.	When	we
need	to	talk,	we	simply	choose	a	letter	from	our	little	alphabet	game	and	agree	on
a	 time.	 Spurio	 is	 a	 thirty-year	 veteran	 of	 the	 police	 force,	 a	 genuine,	 honest	 cop
who	plays	by	the	book	and	despises	almost	everyone	else	in	the	department.	We
have	a	history,	which	began	with	me	as	a	twenty-year-old	college	boy	who	got	too
drunk	in	a	beer	hall	and	found	myself	outside	on	the	sidewalk	getting	roughed	up
by	the	cops,	one	of	whom	was	Nate	Spurio.	He	said	I	cursed	him	and	shoved	him,
and	after	I	woke	up	in	jail	he	stopped	by	to	check	on	me.	I	apologized	profusely.
He	 accepted	 and	 made	 sure	 the	 charges	 were	 dropped.	 My	 broken	 jaw	 healed
nicely,	 and	 the	 cop	 who	 punched	 me	 was	 later	 dismissed.	 The	 incident	 inspired
me	 to	 go	 to	 law	 school.	 Over	 the	 years,	 Spurio	 has	 refused	 to	 play	 the	 political

games	necessary	to	advance	and	has	gone	nowhere.	He’s	usually	hanging	around	a
desk,	filing	papers,	counting	the	days.	But	there	is	a	network	of	other	officers	who
have	 been	 ostracized	 by	 the	 powers	 that	 be,	 and	 Spurio	 spends	 a	 lot	 of	 time
tracking	 the	 gossip.	 He’s	 not	 a	 snitch	 by	 any	 means.	 He’s	 simply	 an	 honest	 cop
who	hates	what	his	department	has	become.
Partner	 stays	 in	 the	 van,	 in	 the	 parking	 lot,	 on	 guard	 in	 case	 other	 cops
happen	by	and	want	a	bagel.	We	huddle	in	a	corner	and	watch	the	door.	He	says,
“Boy	oh	boy,	it’s	a	big	one.”
“Let’s	have	it.”
He	starts	with	Lance’s	arrest,	the	confiscation	of	his	computer,	the	clear	proof
that	the	boy	is	a	small-time	dealer,	and	his	detailed	admission	about	tagging	along
on	 the	 Renfros’	 router.	 Their	 computers	 are	 squeaky-clean,	 but	 Doug	 will	 be
indicted	 day	 after	 tomorrow.	 Keestler	 will	 be	 cleared	 of	 all	 wrongdoing.	 The
typical	cover-up.
“Who	was	there?”	I	ask,	and	he	hands	me	a	folded	sheet	of	paper.	“Eight,	all
from	our	department.	No	state	boys,	no	Feds.”
If	I	have	my	way,	they’ll	be	named	defendants	in	a	lawsuit	seeking	damages
of,	oh,	I	don’t	know,	how	about	$50	million.
“Who	led	the	party?”	I	ask.
“Who	do	you	think?”
“Sumerall?”
“You	 got	 it.	 We	 could	 tell	 from	 watching	 the	 news.	 Once	 again,	 Lieutenant
Chip	 Sumerall	 leads	 his	 fearless	 troops	 into	 a	 quiet	 home	 where	 everybody’s
asleep,	and	he	gets	his	man.	You	gonna	sue?”
I	reply,	“I	don’t	have	the	case	yet,	but	I’m	working	on	it.”
“Thought	you	were	the	best	at	chasing	ambulances.”
“Only	the	ones	I	want.	I’ll	catch	this	one.”
Spurio	 chews	 on	 an	 onion	 bagel,	 washes	 it	 down	 with	 coffee,	 says,	 “These
guys	are	outta	control,	Rudd.	You	gotta	stop	them.”
“No	way,	Nate.	I	can’t	stop	them.	Maybe	I	can	embarrass	them	from	time	to
time,	 cost	 the	 City	 some	 money,	 but	 what	 they’re	 doing	 here	 is	 happening
everywhere.	We	live	in	a	police	state	and	everybody	supports	the	cops.”
“So	you’re	the	last	line	of	defense?”
“Yep.”
“God	help	us.”
“Indeed.	Thanks	for	the	scoop.	I’ll	be	in	touch.”

“Don’t	mention	it.”

4.
Doug	Renfro	is	too	physically	damaged	and	emotionally	overwhelmed	to	meet
with	me,	and	since	a	meeting	would	have	to	take	place	in	his	hospital	room,	it’s	a
bad	idea	anyway.	The	cops	have	the	only	door	secured	as	if	he	were	on	death	row.
Privacy	would	be	impossible.	So	I	meet	with	Thomas	Renfro	and	his	two	sisters	in
a	 coffee	 shop	 down	 the	 street	 from	 the	 hospital.	 The	 three	 are	 sleepwalking
through	their	nightmare,	exhausted,	stunned,	angry,	grief	stricken,	and	desperate
for	 advice.	 They	 ignore	 their	 coffee	 and	 at	 first	 seem	 content	 to	 let	 me	 do	 the
talking.	 Without	 the	 least	 bit	 of	 bluster,	 I	 explain	 who	 I	 am,	 what	 I	 do,	 where	 I
come	from,	and	how	I	protect	my	clients.	I	tell	them	that	I’m	not	a	typical	lawyer.	I
don’t	maintain	a	pretty	office	filled	with	mahogany	and	leather.	I	don’t	belong	to	a
big	 firm,	 prestigious	 or	 otherwise.	 I	 don’t	 do	 good	 works	 through	 the	 bar
association.	I’m	a	lone	gunman,	a	rogue	who	fights	the	system	and	hates	injustice.
I’m	here	right	now	because	I	know	what’s	about	to	happen	to	their	father,	and	to
them.
Fiona,	the	older	sister,	says,	“But	they	murdered	our	mother.”
“Indeed	 they	 did,	 but	 no	 one	 will	 be	 charged	 with	 her	 murder.	 They’ll
investigate,	send	in	the	experts,	and	so	on,	and	in	the	end	they’ll	all	agree	that	she
simply	 got	 caught	 in	 the	 cross	 fire.	 They’ll	 indict	 your	 father	 and	 blame	 him	 for
starting	the	gun	battle.”
Susanna,	the	younger	sister,	says,	“But	we’ve	talked	to	our	father,	Mr.	Rudd.
They	 were	 sound	 asleep	 when	 something	 crashed	 inside	 the	 house.	 He	 thought
they	 were	 being	 robbed.	 He	 grabbed	 his	 gun,	 ran	 into	 the	 hallway,	 then	 hit	 the
floor	 when	 he	 saw	 figures	 in	 the	 dark.	 Someone	 fired	 a	 shot,	 then	 he	 began
returning	fire.	He	says	he	remembers	Mom	screaming	and	running	into	the	hall	to
check	on	him.”
I	say,	“He’s	very	lucky	to	be	alive.	They	shot	both	dogs,	didn’t	they?”
“Who	are	these	goons?”	Thomas	asks	helplessly.
“The	 police,	 the	 good	 guys.”	 I	 then	 tell	 them	 the	 story	 of	 my	 client	 Sonny
Werth,	 with	 the	 tank	 sitting	 in	 his	 den,	 and	 the	 lawsuit	 we	 won.	 I	 explain	 that	 a
civil	 lawsuit	 is	 their	 only	 option	 right	 now.	 Their	 father	 will	 be	 indicted	 and
prosecuted,	and	once	the	truth	is	finally	learned—and	I	promise	them	that	we	will
expose	 everything—there	 will	 be	 enormous	 pressure	 on	 the	 City	 to	 settle.	 Their
endgame	 is	 to	 keep	 their	 father	 out	 of	 jail.	 They	 can	 forget	 justice	 for	 what
happened	to	their	mother.	A	civil	lawsuit,	one	put	together	by	the	right	lawyer	of
course,	guarantees	a	safer	flow	of	information.	The	cover-up	is	already	under	way,
I	say	more	than	once.
They’re	 trying	 their	 best	 to	 listen,	 but	 they’re	 in	 another	 world.	 Who	 could

blame	them?	The	meeting	ends	with	both	women	in	tears	and	Thomas	unable	to
speak.
It’s	time	for	me	to	back	off.

5.
Uninvited,	 though	 it’s	 open	 to	 the	 public,	 I	 arrive	 at	 the	 large	 Methodist
church	 just	 minutes	 before	 the	 service	 for	 Katherine	 Renfro.	 I	 find	 the	 stairs,
climb	up	to	the	balcony,	and	sit	in	the	semidarkness.	I	am	alone	up	here,	but	the
rest	 of	 the	 sanctuary	 is	 packed.	 I	 look	 down	 on	 the	 crowd:	 all	 white,	 all	 middle
class,	all	in	disbelief	that	their	friend	got	shot	seven	times	in	her	pajamas	by	the
police.
Aren’t	these	senseless	tragedies	supposed	to	take	place	in	other	parts	of	town?
These	people	are	hard-core	law-and-order.	They	vote	to	the	right	and	want	tough
laws.	If	they	think	about	SWAT	teams	at	all,	they	think	they’re	necessary	to	fight
terror	and	drugs	in	other	places.	How	could	this	happen	to	them?
Absent	 from	 this	 ceremony	 is	 Doug	 Renfro.	 According	 to	 yesterday’s
Chronicle,	 he	 has	 just	 been	 indicted.	 He’s	 still	 hospitalized,	 though	 recovering
slowly.	 He	 begged	 the	 doctors	 and	 the	 police	 to	 allow	 him	 to	 attend	 his	 wife’s
funeral.	 The	 doctors	 said	 sure;	 the	 cops	 said	 no	 way.	 He’s	 a	 threat	 to	 society.	 A
cruel	 footnote	 to	 this	 tragedy	 is	 that	 Doug	 will	 live	 the	 rest	 of	 his	 life	 under	 the
cloud	of	somehow	being	involved	with	drug	trafficking.	Most	of	these	people	will
believe	him	and	his	denials,	but	for	some	there	will	be	doubts.	What	was	old	Doug
really	up	to?	Surely	he	must’ve	been	guilty	of	something	or	our	brave	police	would
not	have	gone	after	him.
I	 suffer	 through	 the	 service,	 along	 with	 everyone	 else.	 The	 air	 is	 thick	 with
confusion	 and	 anger.	 The	 minister	 is	 comforting,	 but	 at	 times	 clearly	 unsure	 of
what	 has	 happened.	 He	 tries	 to	 make	 some	 sense	 of	 it,	 but	 it’s	 an	 impossible
challenge.	As	he’s	wrapping	things	up,	and	as	the	crying	gets	louder,	I	ease	down
the	stairs	and	exit	through	a	side	door.
Two	hours	later	my	phone	rings.	It’s	Doug	Renfro.

6.
A	 lawyer	 like	 me	 is	 forced	 to	 work	 in	 the	 shadows.	 My	 opponents	 are
protected	by	badges,	uniforms,	and	all	the	myriad	trappings	of	government	power.
They	are	sworn	and	duty-bound	to	uphold	the	law,	but	since	they	cheat	like	hell	it
forces	me	to	cheat	even	more.
I	 have	 a	 network	 of	 contacts	 and	 sources.	 I	 can’t	 call	 them	 friends	 because
friendships	require	commitments.	Nate	Spurio	is	one	example,	an	honest	cop	who
wouldn’t	take	a	dime	for	inside	information.	I’ve	offered.	Another	guy	is	a	reporter
with	 the	 Chronicle,	 and	 we	 swap	 gossip	 when	 it’s	 convenient.	 No	 cash	 changes
hands.	One	of	my	favorites	is	Okie	Schwin,	and	Okie	always	takes	the	money.
Okie	 is	 a	 mid-level	 paper	 pusher	 in	 the	 federal	 court	 clerk’s	 office	 in	 a
downtown	 courthouse.	 He	 hates	 his	 job,	 despises	 his	 co-workers,	 and	 is	 always
looking	for	an	easy	way	to	make	a	buck.	He’s	also	divorced,	drinks	too	much,	and
constantly	tests	the	boundaries	of	workplace	sexual	harassment.	Okie’s	value	is	his
ability	to	manipulate	the	court’s	random	assignment	of	cases.	When	a	civil	lawsuit
is	 filed,	 it	 is	 supposedly	 assigned	 by	 chance	 to	 one	 of	 our	 six	 federal	 judges.	 A
computer	does	this	and	the	little	procedure	seems	to	work	fine.	There’s	always	a
judge	 you’d	 prefer,	 depending	 on	 the	 type	 of	 case	 and	 perhaps	 your	 history	 in
various	 courtrooms,	 but	 who	 cares	 when	 it’s	 completely	 random?	 Okie,	 though,
knows	how	to	rig	the	software	and	find	the	judge	you	really	want.	He	charges	for
this,	handsomely,	and	he’ll	probably	get	caught,	though	he	assures	me	there’s	no
way.	 If	 he’s	 caught,	 he’ll	 get	 fired	 and	 maybe	 prosecuted,	 but	 Okie	 seems
unconcerned	by	these	possibilities.
At	 his	 suggestion,	 we	 meet	 in	 a	 seedy	 strip	 club	 far	 from	 downtown.	 The
crowd	is	staunchly	blue	collar.	The	strippers	are	not	worth	describing.	I	turn	my
back	to	the	stage	so	I	don’t	have	to	look.	Just	under	the	roar,	I	say,	“I’m	filing	suit
tomorrow.	Renfro,	our	SWAT	boys’	latest	home	invasion.”
He	laughs	and	says,	“What	a	surprise.	Let	me	guess,	you	think	justice	will	be
best	served	if	the	Honorable	Arnie	Samson	presides.”
“My	man.”
“He’s	 110	 years	 old,	 on	 senior	 status,	 half-dead,	 and	 he	 says	 he’s	 not	 taking
cases	anymore.	Why	can’t	we	make	these	guys	retire?”
“That’s	 between	 you	 and	 the	 Constitution.	 He’ll	 take	 this	 one.	 The	 standard
fee?”
“Yep.	But	what	if	he	says	no	and	bounces	it	down	the	line?”
“I’ll	have	to	take	that	chance.”	I	hand	him	an	envelope	with	$3,000	in	cash.
His	 standard	 fee.	 He	 quickly	 shoves	 it	 into	 a	 pocket	 without	 even	 a	 thank-you,

then	turns	his	attention	to	the	girls.

7.
At	 nine	 the	 following	 morning,	 I	 walk	 into	 the	 clerk’s	 office	 and	 file	 a	 $50
million	 lawsuit	 against	 the	 City,	 the	 police	 department,	 the	 police	 chief,	 and	 the
eight	SWAT	boys	who	attacked	the	Renfros’	home	six	days	earlier.	Somewhere	in
the	murky	depths	of	the	office,	Okie	does	his	magic	and	the	case	is	“randomly	and
automatically”	assigned	to	Judge	Arnold	Samson.	I	e-mail	a	copy	of	the	lawsuit	to
my	friend	at	the	Chronicle.
I	 also	 file	 a	 request	 for	 a	 temporary	 restraining	 order	 to	 prevent	 the
prosecutor	from	freezing	Doug	Renfro’s	assets.	This	is	a	favorite	strong-arm	tactic
used	by	the	government	to	harass	criminal	defendants.	The	original	idea	was	to	tie
up	assets	supposedly	accumulated	in	whatever	criminal	activity	the	defendant	was
engaged	in,	primarily	drug	trafficking.	Seize	the	ill-gotten	gains	and	make	things
tough	for	the	cartels.	And	like	so	many	laws,	it	didn’t	take	the	prosecutors	long	to
get	creative	and	expand	its	use.	In	Doug’s	case,	the	government	was	prepared	to
argue	 that	 his	 assets—home,	 cars,	 bank	 and	 retirement	 accounts—were
accumulated,	in	part,	with	dirty	money	he	earned	while	peddling	Ecstasy.
Say	 what?	 By	 the	 time	 we	 have	 the	 emergency	 hearing	 on	 the	 temporary
restraining	order,	the	city	prosecutors	are	backing	down	and	looking	for	a	way	out.
Judge	 Samson,	 as	 feisty	 as	 ever,	 scolds	 them	 and	 even	 threatens	 them	 with
contempt.	We	win	round	1.
Round	2	is	a	bail	hearing	in	state	court,	where	the	attempted	murder	charge
is	 pending.	 With	 his	 assets	 free,	 I’m	 able	 to	 argue	 that	 Doug	 Renfro	 poses
absolutely	no	flight	risk	and	will	show	up	in	court	whenever	he’s	supposed	to.	His
home	 is	 worth	 $400,000	 with	 no	 mortgage,	 and	 I	 offer	 to	 post	 the	 deed	 as
security.	To	my	surprise,	the	judge	agrees,	and	I	walk	my	client	out	of	court.	We
win	round	2,	but	these	are	the	easy	ones.
Eight	days	after	getting	shot	and	losing	his	wife	and	both	dogs,	Doug	Renfro
returns	 home,	 where	 his	 three	 children,	 seven	 grandchildren,	 and	 some	 friends
are	 waiting.	 It	 will	 be	 a	 subdued	 homecoming.	 They	 graciously	 ask	 me	 to	 join
them,	but	I	decline.
I	fight	tooth	and	nail	for	my	clients	and	will	break	most	laws	to	protect	them,
but	I	never	get	too	close.

8.
At	ten	on	a	perfect	Saturday	morning,	I’m	sitting	on	a	bench	at	a	playground,
waiting.	 It’s	 a	 few	 blocks	 from	 my	 apartment,	 our	 usual	 meeting	 place.	 On	 the
sidewalk,	a	beautiful	woman	approaches	with	a	seven-year-old	boy.	He	is	my	son.
She	is	my	ex-wife.	The	court	order	allows	me	to	see	him	once	a	month	for	thirtysix	hours.	As	he	gets	older,	I	will	be	entitled	to	more	lenient	visitation,	but	for	now
things	 are	 restricted.	 There	 are	 reasons	 for	 this	 but	 I’d	 rather	 not	 discuss	 them
now.
Starcher	does	not	smile	when	they	get	to	the	bench.	I	stand	and	peck	Judith
on	the	cheek,	more	for	the	kid’s	benefit	than	hers.	She	prefers	not	to	touch.
“Hey,	buddy,”	I	say,	rubbing	his	head.
“Hey,”	 he	 says,	 then	 walks	 over	 to	 a	 swing	 and	 climbs	 onto	 it.	 Judith	 sits
beside	me	on	the	bench	and	we	watch	him	kick	and	begin	swaying.
“How’s	he	doing?”	I	ask.
“Fine.	His	teachers	are	happy.”	A	long	pause.	“I	see	you’ve	been	quite	busy.”
“Indeed.	And	you?”
“The	usual	grind.”
“How’s	Ava?”	I	ask	about	her	partner.
“She’s	great.	What	are	your	plans	for	the	day?”
Judith	 does	 not	 like	 leaving	 our	 son	 with	 me.	 Once	 again,	 I’ve	 managed	 to
offend	the	police	and	this	worries	her.	Worries	me	too	but	I	would	never	admit	it.
I	say,	“I	figure	we’ll	do	lunch.	Then	there’s	a	soccer	game	at	the	university	this
afternoon.”
She	thinks	a	soccer	game	is	safe	enough.	She	says,	“I’d	like	to	have	him	back
tonight,	if	that’s	okay.”
“I	get	thirty-six	hours	once	a	month	and	that’s	too	much?”
“No,	Sebastian,	it’s	not	too	much.	I’m	just	worried,	that’s	all.”
Our	fighting	days	are	almost	over,	I	hope.	Take	two	lawyers	with	sharp	elbows
and	even	sharper	tongues,	give	them	an	unwanted	pregnancy,	a	nasty	divorce	with
brutal	aftershocks,	and	you	have	two	people	who	can	inflict	serious	damage.	We’re
still	scarred,	so	we	don’t	fight,	much.
“Fine,”	 I	 say,	 in	 full	 retreat.	 Truthfully,	 there’s	 nothing	 appealing	 about	 my
apartment	and	Starcher	doesn’t	really	like	staying	there,	not	yet	anyway.	He’s	too
short	to	shoot	pool	on	my	vintage	table	and	I	don’t	own	any	video	games.	Maybe
when	he’s	older.

He	is	being	raised	by	two	women	who	freak	out	if	another	kid	shoves	him	at
school.	I’m	not	sure	I	can	toughen	him	up	by	popping	into	his	life	once	a	month,
but	 I’m	 trying.	 Down	 the	 road,	 I	 suspect	 he’ll	 get	 tired	 of	 living	 with	 a	 couple	 of
edgy,	 intense	 women	 and	 want	 more	 time	 with	 his	 old	 man.	 My	 challenge	 is	 to
remain	relevant	enough	in	his	life	to	offer	him	that	option.
“What	time	shall	we	meet?”	she	asks.
“Whenever.”
“I’ll	 meet	 you	 here	 at	 6:00	 p.m.,”	 she	 says	 as	 she	 gets	 to	 her	 feet	 and	 walks
away.	Starcher,	his	back	to	us,	soars	through	the	air	and	does	not	see	her	leave.	It
does	 not	 escape	 me	 that	 Judith	 did	 not	 bother	 to	 bring	 an	 overnight	 bag	 for	 the
kid.	She	had	no	intention	of	allowing	him	to	sleep	at	my	place.
I	live	on	the	twenty-fifth	floor	because	I	feel	safer	there.	I	routinely	get	death
threats	for	a	variety	of	reasons,	and	I’ve	been	honest	with	Judith	about	this.	She	is
not	 wrong	 for	 wanting	 the	 kid	 at	 home,	 where	 things	 are	 probably	 calmer.
Probably,	 but	 I	 don’t	 know	 for	 sure.	 Just	 last	 month	 Starcher	 told	 me	 his	 “two
mothers”	yell	at	each	other	all	the	time.
For	lunch	we	go	to	my	favorite	pizza	parlor,	a	place	his	mothers	would	never
take	 him.	 The	 truth	 is	 I	 don’t	 care	 what	 he	 eats.	 In	 many	 ways	 I’m	 more	 like	 a
grandparent	who	spoils	the	kids	before	sending	them	back	home.	If	he	wants	Ben
&	Jerry’s	before	and	after	lunch,	so	be	it.
As	we	eat,	he	comes	to	life	while	I	quiz	him	about	school.	He’s	in	the	second
grade	 in	 a	 public	 school	 not	 far	 from	 where	 I	 grew	 up.	 Judith	 insisted	 he	 attend
some	 crunchy	 little	 granola	 academy	 where	 all	 plastic	 is	 forbidden	 and	 all	 the
teachers	wear	thick	wool	socks	and	old	sandals.	At	$40,000	a	year	I	said	hell	no.
She	 ran	 back	 to	 court,	 and	 for	 once	 the	 judge	 sided	 with	 me.	 So	 Starcher	 is	 in	 a
normal	 school	 with	 kids	 of	 all	 colors	 and	 a	 seriously	 cute	 teacher,	 recently
divorced.
As	 I’ve	 said,	 Starcher	 was	 a	 mistake.	 Judith	 and	 I	 were	 in	 the	 process	 of
ending	 our	 chaotic	 relationship	 when	 she	 somehow	 got	 pregnant.	 The	 split	 grew
even	more	complicated.	I	moved	out	and	she	assumed	total	possession	of	him.	I
was	stiff-armed	at	every	point,	though,	to	be	honest,	I	have	never	clamored	to	be	a
father.	 He’s	 all	 hers,	 at	 least	 in	 her	 opinion,	 so	 it’s	 becoming	 hilarious	 to	 watch
him	grow	into	a	little	boy	who	looks	exactly	like	me.	My	mother	found	my	secondgrade	school	photo.	At	seven,	we	could	pass	for	identical	twins.
We	 talk	 about	 fighting,	 the	 school-yard	 variety.	 I	 ask	 him	 if	 he	 sees	 fights
during	recess,	and	he	says,	“Occasionally.”	He	tells	me	the	story	of	the	day	when
kids	 began	 yelling,	 “Fight!	 Fight!”	 and	 everyone	 ran	 over	 to	 watch.	 Two	 third
graders,	 one	 black	 and	 one	 white,	 were	 on	 the	 ground	 kicking	 and	 squirming,
biting	and	clawing	and	swapping	punches	while	the	crowd	yelled	encouragement.
“Was	it	fun	to	watch?”	I	ask.

He	smiles	and	says,	“Sure.	It	was	cool.”
“What	happened?”
“The	teachers	came	and	got	them	and	took	them	into	the	office.	I	think	they
got	in	trouble.”
“I’m	sure	they	did.	Has	your	mother	ever	talked	to	you	about	fighting?”
He	shakes	his	head.	No.
“Okay.	Here	are	the	rules.	Fighting	is	bad	and	will	only	get	you	in	trouble,	so
don’t	 fight.	 Never	 start	 a	 fight.	 But,	 if	 someone	 else	 hits	 you,	 or	 pushes	 you,	 or
trips	 you,	 or	 if	 two	 guys	 jump	 on	 a	 friend	 of	 yours,	 then	 sometimes	 you	 have	 to
fight.	 Never	 back	 down	 when	 the	 other	 guy	 starts	 a	 fight.	 And	 when	 you	 fight,
never,	never,	never	give	up.”
“Did	you	get	into	fights?”
“All	the	time.	I	was	never	a	bully	and	I	never	started	a	fight.	And	I	didn’t	like
to	fight,	but	if	the	other	guy	pushed	me	around,	then	I	hit	him	back.”
“Did	you	get	in	trouble?”
“I	did.	I	took	my	punishment.”
“What	does	that	mean?”
“Means	the	teacher	yelled	at	me	and	my	mother	yelled	at	me	and	maybe	they
kicked	me	out	of	school	for	half	a	day	or	something	like	that.	Again,	bud,	fighting
is	wrong.”
“Why	do	you	always	call	me	bud?”
Because	 I	 loathe	 the	 name	 your	 mother	 chose	 for	 you.	 “Just	 a	 nickname,
that’s	all.”
“Mom	says	you	don’t	like	my	name.”
“Not	 true,	 bud.”	 Judith	 will	 always	 be	 at	 war	 over	 the	 soul	 of	 her	 son.	 She
cannot	 rise	 above	 the	 temptation	 of	 the	 silliest	 cheap	 shot.	 Why	 on	 earth	 would
one	parent	tell	a	seven-year-old	that	the	other	parent	doesn’t	like	his	name?	I’m
sure	I’d	be	shocked	at	the	other	crap	she’s	told	him.
Partner	has	the	day	off,	so	I	drive	my	van	to	the	soccer	stadium	on	campus.
Starcher	 thinks	 the	 van	 is	 cool,	 with	 its	 sofa,	 swivel	 chairs,	 small	 desk,	 and
television.	He’s	not	sure	why	I	use	it	as	an	office,	and	I	have	not	gone	into	details
about	the	bulletproof	windows	and	automatic	pistol	in	the	console.
It’s	a	women’s	soccer	game,	not	that	it	matters	to	me.	I	don’t	follow	the	sport,
so	if	I’m	forced	to	watch	it	I’d	rather	see	girls	in	shorts	than	guys	with	hairy	legs.
Starcher,	though,	loves	the	excitement.	His	mothers	do	not	believe	in	team	sports,
so	he’s	just	been	signed	up	for	tennis	lessons.	Nothing	wrong	with	tennis,	but	if	he
gets	my	moves	he	won’t	last	long.	I	always	liked	to	hit.	In	youth	basketball	I	was

the	kid	with	four	fouls	by	halftime.	Always	more	fouls	than	points.	In	Pop	Warner
football	I	played	linebacker	because	I	loved	the	contact.
After	 an	 hour	 someone	 finally	 scores,	 but	 by	 then	 I’m	 thinking	 about	 the
Renfro	 case	 and	 any	 interest	 I	 had	 in	 the	 game	 is	 gone.	 Starcher	 and	 I	 share	 a
popcorn	 and	 talk	 about	 this	 and	 that.	 The	 truth	 is,	 I’m	 so	 far	 detached	 from	 his
little	world	that	I	can’t	sustain	a	decent	conversation.
I’m	such	a	pathetic	father.

9.
Sanity	 slowly	 arrives	 in	 the	 Renfro	 disaster.	 Under	 pressure	 from	 all	 sides,
but	especially	from	my	pal	at	the	Chronicle,	the	City	flounders	with	its	response.
The	chief	of	police	has	gone	mum,	claiming	he	can’t	comment	because	of	pending
litigation.	 The	 mayor	 is	 running	 for	 cover,	 obviously	 trying	 to	 create	 some
distance.	 Hot	 on	 his	 ass	 are	 his	 enemies,	 some	 city	 councilmen	 who	 enjoy	 the
grandstanding	 and	 would	 like	 to	 have	 his	 job.	 They	 are	 in	 a	 minority,	 though,
because	no	one	really	wants	trouble	with	the	police	department.
Sadly,	 dissent	 nowadays	 is	 considered	 unpatriotic,	 and	 in	 our	 post-9/11
atmosphere	 any	 criticism	 of	 those	 in	 uniform,	 any	 uniform,	 is	 stifled.	 Being
labeled	soft	on	crime	or	soft	on	terror	is	a	politician’s	curse.
I’m	feeding	everything	to	my	pal	at	the	newspaper.	Citing	unnamed	sources,
he’s	 having	 a	 ball	 hammering	 away	 at	 the	 cops	 and	 their	 tactics,	 screwups,	 and
attempts	to	cover	up.	Using	materials	from	my	files,	he	runs	a	lengthy	piece	about
the	history	of	botched	invasions	and	excessive	force.
I’m	 getting	 as	 much	 press	 as	 I	 can	 possibly	 generate.	 I	 cannot	 lie	 and	 say	 I
don’t	love	this;	indeed,	I	live	for	it.
The	defendants	file	a	motion	with	Judge	Samson	and	ask	him	to,	in	effect,	put
a	 muzzle	 on	 “all	 lawyers	 involved	 in	 the	 civil	 lawsuit.”	 Judge	 Samson	 denies	 the
motion	without	even	the	benefit	of	a	hearing.	Right	now,	the	attorneys	for	the	City
are	 terrified	 of	 the	 judge	 and	 running	 for	 cover.	 I’m	 firing	 as	 many	 bullets	 as
possible.
I	 practice	 alone,	 without	 a	 real	 office	 and	 certainly	 without	 a	 real	 staff.	 It’s
extremely	difficult	for	a	lone	gunman	like	me	to	engage	in	high-powered	civil	and
criminal	litigation	without	some	support,	which	is	where	the	two	Harrys	come	in.
Harry	 Gross	 and	 Harry	 Skulnick	 run	 a	 fifteen-lawyer	 shop	 in	 a	 converted
warehouse	downtown	by	the	river.	They	do	mostly	appellate	work	and	try	to	avoid
jury	trials,	and	thus	spend	their	hours	buried	in	books	and	pushing	legal	pads	and
briefs	 around	 their	 desks.	 Our	 arrangement	 is	 simple:	 They	 do	 my	 research	 and
paperwork,	and	I	give	them	one-third	of	the	fees.	This	allows	them	to	play	it	safe,
to	keep	some	distance	from	me,	my	clients,	and	the	people	I	tend	to	irritate.	They
will	 prepare	 a	 stack	 of	 motions	 an	 inch	 thick,	 hand	 it	 to	 me	 for	 my	 review	 and
signature,	and	nothing	can	be	traced	back	to	them.	They	toil	away	behind	locked
doors	 and	 never	 worry	 about	 the	 police.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 Sonny	 Werth—the	 client
who	 woke	 up	 with	 the	 tank	 roaring	 into	 his	 den—the	 City	 settled	 for	 a	 million
bucks.	My	cut	was	25	percent.	The	two	Harrys	got	a	nice	check	and	everybody	was
happy,	except	for	Sonny.
In	 this	 state,	 all	 damages	 in	 civil	 cases	 are	 capped	 at	 $1	 million.	 This	 is
because	 the	 wise	 people	 who	 make	 the	 laws	 in	 our	 state	 legislature	 decided	 ten

years	ago	that	their	judgment	was	far	superior	to	that	of	the	actual	jurors	who	hear
the	evidence	and	evaluate	the	damages.	They,	the	lawmakers,	were	hoodwinked	by
the	insurance	companies	who	are	still	funding	the	national	tort	reform	movement,
a	political	crusade	that	has	been	wildly	successful.	Virtually	every	state	has	fallen
in	line	with	caps	on	damages	and	other	laws	designed	to	keep	folks	away	from	the
courthouse.	So	far,	no	one	has	seen	a	decline	in	insurance	rates.	An	investigative
report	by	my	pal	at	the	Chronicle	revealed	that	90	percent	of	our	legislators	took
campaign	 money	 from	 the	 insurance	 industry.	 And	 this	 is	 considered	 a
democracy.
Every	street	lawyer	in	this	state	can	tell	you	a	horror	story	of	a	badly	maimed
and	permanently	injured	client	who,	after	medical	expenses,	got	almost	nothing.
Not	 long	 after	 slamming	 the	 courthouse	 doors,	 these	 same	 wise	 and
courageous	legislators	passed	another	law	that	prohibits	homeowners	from	firing
upon	cops	who	invade	their	homes,	regardless	of	whether	the	cops	have	the	right
home	or	not.	So	when	Doug	Renfro	hit	the	floor	and	began	firing	his	pistol,	he	was
violating	the	law,	with	no	real	defense.
What	 about	 the	 real	 criminals?	 Well,	 our	 legislators	 passed	 yet	 another	 law
that	 grants	 criminal	 immunity	 to	 SWAT	 teams	 who	 get	 a	 bit	 carried	 away	 and
shoot	the	wrong	person.	In	the	Renfro	disaster,	four	cops	fired	at	least	thirty-eight
rounds.	It’s	not	clear	who	actually	shot	Doug	and	his	wife,	and	it	doesn’t	matter.
They	are	all	immune	from	criminal	prosecution.
I	 spend	 hours	 with	 Doug	 trying	 to	 explain	 these	 legal	 principles,	 none	 of
which	make	sense.	He	wants	to	know	why	his	wife’s	life	is	worth	only	$1	million.	I
explain	 that	 his	 state	 senator	 voted	 for	 this	 cap	 on	 damages—and	 that	 he	 also
takes	 money	 from	 insurance	 lobbyists—so	 perhaps	 Doug	 should	 contact	 this
elected	official	and	bitch	about	the	way	he	votes.
Doug	asks,	“Then	why	did	we	sue	for	$50	million	when	the	most	we	can	get	is
only	$1	million?”	Another	question	with	a	long	answer.	First,	it’s	called	making	a
statement.	We’re	angry	and	fighting	back,	and	suing	for	$50	million	sounds	much
more	aggressive	than	a	mere	$1	million.	Second,	a	quirk	in	this	already	screwedup	 law	 prohibits	 the	 jurors	 from	 knowing	 about	 the	 $1	 million	 cap.	 They	 can	 sit
through	a	month	of	testimony,	evaluate	the	evidence,	deliberate	thoughtfully,	and
return	a	proper	verdict	of,	say,	$5	to	$10	million.	Then	they	go	home,	and	the	next
day	the	judge	quietly	reduces	the	verdict	down	to	the	cap.	The	newspaper	might
trumpet	 another	 big	 verdict,	 but	 the	 lawyers	 and	 judges	 (and	 insurance
companies)	know	the	truth.
It	 makes	 no	 sense,	 but	 bear	 in	 mind	 this	 law	 was	 written	 by	 the	 same
conspirators	who	insert	endless	gibberish	into	your	insurance	policies.
Doug	asks,	“But	how	can	a	cop	kick	in	my	door	and	shoot	me	with	immunity,
but	if	I	return	fire	I’m	a	criminal	looking	at	twenty	years?”	The	simple	answer	is
because	they	are	cops.	The	complicated	answer	is	that	our	lawmakers	often	pass

laws	that	are	not	fair.
My	client	is	still	in	mourning,	but	some	of	the	shock	and	grief	are	beginning
to	 subside.	 His	 thinking	 is	 getting	 clearer;	 reality	 is	 setting	 in.	 His	 wife	 is	 gone,
murdered	 by	 men	 who	 will	 not	 be	 held	 accountable.	 Her	 life	 is	 worth	 only	 $1
million.	 And	 he,	 Mr.	 Doug	 Renfro,	 is	 in	 the	 midst	 of	 a	 criminal	 prosecution	 that
will	one	day	drag	him	into	a	courtroom	where	his	only	hope	will	be	a	hung	jury.
The	 road	 to	 justice	 is	 filled	 with	 barriers	 and	 land	 mines,	 most	 of	 them
created	by	men	and	women	who	claim	to	be	seeking	justice.

10.
My	little	cage	fighter,	Tadeo	Zapate,	has	won	his	last	four	fights,	all	by	brutal
knockouts.	That’s	eleven	in	a	row,	with	only	three	career	losses,	all	on	points.	He’s
now	 thirty-second	 in	 the	 world	 bantamweight	 rankings	 and	 moving	 up	 nicely.
UFC	promoters	are	taking	notice.	There’s	talk	of	a	fight	in	Vegas	in	six	months,	if
he	keeps	winning.	Oscar,	his	trainer,	and	Norberto,	his	manager,	tell	me	they	can’t
keep	the	kid	out	of	the	gym.	He	is	focused,	hungry,	almost	manic	in	his	quest	for	a
title	fight.	They	work	him	hard	and	are	convinced	he	can	be	a	top-five	contender.
Tonight	 he	 fights	 a	 tough	 black	 kid	 with	 the	 stage	 name	 of	 Crush.	 I’ve	 seen
Crush	 fight	 twice	 and	 he	 doesn’t	 worry	 me.	 He’s	 just	 a	 brawler,	 a	 street	 fighter
with	limited	training	in	mixed	martial	arts.	In	both	fights	he	got	knocked	out	late
in	the	third	round	because	of	fatigue.	He	starts	with	a	bang,	cannot	pace	himself,
and	pays	for	it	at	the	end.
I	wake	up	with	a	bad	case	of	butterflies,	thinking	of	nothing	but	the	fight,	and
cannot	 eat	 breakfast.	 I’m	 puttering	 around	 the	 apartment	 late	 in	 the	 afternoon
when	Judith	calls	my	cell.	There’s	an	emergency—her	college	roommate	has	been
seriously	 injured	 in	 an	 auto	 accident	 in	 Chicago.	 Judith	 is	 racing	 to	 the	 airport.
Ava,	her	partner,	is	out	of	town,	so	it’s	up	to	me	to	man	up	and	be	a	father.	I	bite
my	tongue	and	do	not	tell	her	that	I	have	plans.	It’s	fight	night!
We	meet	at	the	park	and	she	delivers	our	son,	his	duffel	bag,	and	a	barrage	of
warnings	and	instructions.	Normally,	I’d	snap	back	and	we’d	argue,	but	Starcher
seems	 to	 be	 in	 good	 spirits	 and	 eager	 to	 get	 away	 from	 her.	 I’ve	 never	 met	 her
college	 roommate,	 so	 I	 don’t	 inquire.	 She	 storms	 off,	 jumps	 in	 her	 car,	 and
disappears.	Over	pizza,	I	ask	Starcher	if	he’s	ever	seen	a	cage	fight	on	television.	Of
course	 not!	 His	 mothers	 monitor	 everything	 he	 reads,	 watches,	 eats,	 drinks,	 and
thinks.
Last	 month,	 though,	 he	 spent	 the	 night	 with	 a	 friend,	 Tony,	 who	 has	 a	 big
brother	 named	 Zack,	 and	 late	 that	 night	 Zack	 pulled	 out	 a	 laptop	 and	 they
watched	all	manner	of	evil,	including	an	Ultimate	Fight.
I	ask,	“How	was	it?”
“Pretty	cool,”	he	says	with	a	grin.	“You’re	not	mad?”
“Of	course	not.	I	love	those	fights.”
I	go	on	to	explain	how	our	night	will	go.	The	kid’s	face	lights	up	like	I’ve	never
seen.	I	make	him	swear	that	he	will	not,	under	any	circumstances,	tell	his	mothers
about	going	to	the	fights.	I	explain	that	I	have	no	choice;	that	I	have	to	be	there	as
part	of	a	team;	and	that	under	normal	circumstances	he	would	not	be	invited.	“Let
me	handle	your	mother,”	I	say,	without	much	confidence,	but	then	I	realize	he	will
be	grilled	mercilessly	about	the	evening.

“Let’s	just	say	we	had	pizza	and	watched	TV	in	my	apartment,	which	will	be
the	truth	because	we’re	eating	pizza	now	and	we’ll	turn	on	the	television	when	we
get	to	my	apartment.”
For	a	second	he	looks	confused,	then	lights	up	again.
Back	at	my	apartment,	he	watches	a	cartoon	while	I	change	clothes.	He	likes
my	 shiny	 yellow	 jacket	 with	 “Tadeo	 Zapate”	 emblazoned	 across	 the	 back,	 and	 it
takes	me	a	while	to	explain	that	I	work	the	corner.	Each	fighter	has	a	corner	team
to	help	him	between	rounds,	and,	well,	I’m	in	charge	of	water	and	anything	else
that	Tadeo	might	need.	No,	I’m	not	really	that	necessary,	but	it	sure	is	a	lot	of	fun.
Partner	picks	us	up	in	the	black	van	and	we	ride	to	the	city	auditorium.	For
the	 next	 two	 hours,	 Partner	 will	 do	 the	 babysitting,	 a	 new	 role	 for	 him.	 Driver,
bodyguard,	 errand	 boy,	 investigator,	 confidant,	 strategist,	 and	 now	 this.	 He
doesn’t	 mind.	 I	 pull	 some	 strings	 and	 get	 them	 two	 seats	 on	 the	 floor,	 six	 rows
back	from	the	cage.	Once	they	are	situated	with	popcorn	and	sodas,	I	tell	Starcher
that	I	have	to	go	check	on	my	fighter.	He’s	excited,	wide-eyed,	chattering	away	to
Partner,	 who’s	 already	 his	 best	 friend.	 Though	 I	 know	 the	 kid	 is	 safe,	 I’m	 still
worried.	 Worried	 that	 his	 mother	 will	 find	 out	 and	 sue	 me	 again	 for	 neglect,
corruption	 of	 a	 minor,	 and	 anything	 else	 she	 can	 possibly	 throw	 at	 me.	 Worried
also	 that	 with	 this	 crowd	 anything	 can	 happen.	 I	 watch	 a	 lot	 of	 fights	 and	 have
often	 thought	 that	 it’s	 safer	 inside	 the	 ring	 than	 out	 in	 the	 crowd.	 The	 fans	 are
drinking	and	rowdy	and	they	want	blood.
A	 city	 councilwoman	 in	 some	 place	 like	 Wichita	 tried	 to	 pass	 an	 ordinance
that	 would	 prohibit	 anyone	 under	 the	 age	 of	 eighteen	 from	 being	 admitted	 to	 a
cage	fight.	It	failed,	but	there	is	some	wisdom	behind	it.	Since	there’s	no	such	law
in	our	city,	young	Starcher	Whitly	has	a	ringside	seat.
Zapate	 versus	 Crush	 is	 the	 main	 event,	 which	 is	 fantastic,	 of	 course,	 right
where	we	want	to	be,	but	it	requires	a	long	wait	through	the	undercard.	Tonight
there	are	five	warm-ups,	so	the	evening	will	move	painfully	slowly.
I	 check	 in	 with	 Team	 Zapate	 and	 everyone	 is	 in	 good	 spirits.	 Subdued,	 as
always,	but	quite	confident.	Tadeo	is	still	in	street	clothes,	lying	on	a	table	with	his
headphones	on.	His	brother	Miguel	says	he’s	ready.	Oscar	whispers	that	it	will	be
a	 first-round	 knockout.	 I	 hang	 around	 for	 a	 few	 minutes	 but	 can’t	 stand	 the
tension.	I	leave	and	walk	through	a	tunnel	to	a	lower	level	where	my	little	gang	of
criminals	 is	 waiting	 in	 a	 supply	 room.	 Slide,	 the	 convicted	 murderer,	 has	 been
losing	lately	and	has	cut	back	on	his	wagers.	Nino,	the	meth	dealer,	has,	as	always,
a	 pocketful	 of	 cash	 and	 is	 splashing	 it	 around.	 Denardo,	 the	 Mafia	 wannabe,
doesn’t	 like	 any	 of	 the	 fights.	 Johnny	 is	 absent.	 Frankie,	 the	 old	 guy	 and	 our
scorekeeper,	is	nursing	a	double	scotch,	probably	not	his	first.	We	work	through
the	 undercard	 and	 place	 our	 bets.	 As	 usual,	 no	 one	 will	 bet	 against	 my	 man.	 I
chide	 them,	 taunt	 them,	 curse	 them,	 but	 they	 don’t	 budge.	 I	 offer	 $10,000	 for	 a
first-round	knockout	but	get	no	takers.	Frustrated,	I	leave	with	only	$5,000	on	the
table,	a	grand	for	each	bout	on	the	undercard.

I	pay	eight	bucks	for	a	watered-down	beer	and	climb	to	the	nosebleed	section,
which	is	packed.	A	sellout,	standing	room	only.	Tadeo	is	becoming	a	big	draw	in
his	 hometown,	 and	 I	 hammered	 the	 promoter	 for	 a	 guaranteed	 purse.	 Eight
thousand	dollars—win,	lose,	or	draw.	I	lean	on	a	steel	beam	above	the	top	row	and
watch	the	first	fight.	I	can	barely	see	my	kid	in	the	crowd,	way	down	there.
I	lose	my	bets	on	the	first	four	fights,	win	the	fifth,	then	hustle	to	the	dressing
room.	Team	Zapate	crowds	around	its	hero,	who	also	wears	bright	yellow.	We	look
like	a	sack	of	organic	lemons.	We	walk	him	through	the	tunnel	and	into	the	lights,
and	the	crowd	goes	wild.	I	wave	at	Starcher	and	he	waves	back	with	a	huge	smile
on	his	face.
Round	 1.	 Three	 minutes	 of	 boredom	 as	 Crush,	 to	 our	 surprise,	 does	 not
charge	 across	 the	 ring	 like	 a	 mad	 dog.	 Instead,	 he	 plays	 defense	 and	 escapes
serious	 damage.	 Using	 a	 left	 jab	 that	 at	 times	 is	 hard	 to	 see,	 Tadeo	 opens	 a	 cut
over	Crush’s	right	eye.	Late	in	the	round,	Crush	returns	the	favor	with	a	nasty	gash
across	Tadeo’s	forehead.	Oscar	manages	to	close	it	between	rounds.	Cuts	are	not
that	 critical	 in	 cage	 fighting	 because	 the	 fights	 are	 so	 short.	 In	 boxing,	 a	 firstround	cut	is	terrifying	because	it	becomes	a	target	for	the	next	half	hour.
Round	2.	They	hit	the	deck	and	grapple	for	the	first	half	of	the	round.	Crush
has	a	strong	upper	body	and	Tadeo	is	unable	to	pin	him.	Boos	can	be	heard.	Back
on	their	feet,	they	spar	and	kick	with	neither	scoring	much.	Just	before	the	bell,
Tadeo	lands	a	hard	right	to	the	jaw	that	would	have	flattened	any	of	the	last	dozen
or	 so	 men	 he’s	 faced,	 but	 Crush	 stays	 on	 his	 feet.	 As	 Tadeo	 goes	 in	 for	 the	 kill,
Crush	manages	to	grab	his	waist	and	hang	on	until	the	bell.	Suddenly	I	don’t	like
this	fight.	Tadeo	is	clearly	ahead	on	points,	but	I	don’t	trust	judges.
Perhaps	it’s	the	nature	of	my	profession.
I	like	knockouts,	not	decisions.
Round	3.	Having	paced	himself,	Crush	figures	he’s	got	some	gas	in	the	tank.
He	charges	across	the	ring	and	surprises	everyone	with	a	wild	flurry	that	ignites
the	crowd.	It’s	certainly	exciting,	but	not	damaging.	Tadeo	covers	well,	then	lands
a	 couple	 of	 hard	 jabs	 that	 draw	 more	 blood.	 Crush	 charges	 again,	 and	 again.
Tadeo,	 the	 boxer,	 picks	 his	 openings	 and	 shoots	 jabs	 that	 land	 beautifully.	 I’m
screaming,	the	crowd	is	screaming,	the	floor	seems	to	be	shaking.	Meanwhile,	the
clock	 is	 ticking	 and	 Crush	 is	 still	 out	 there,	 charging	 and	 charging,	 his	 face	 a
bloody	mess.	He	lands	a	wild	right	and	Tadeo	goes	down,	but	only	for	a	second.
Crush	leaps	on	top	of	him	and	they	kick	and	claw	and	finally	manage	to	untangle.
Tadeo	has	not	gone	this	late	in	a	fight	in	a	long	time,	and	he	begins	to	press.	Crush
charges	again,	and	for	the	final	minute	they	go	toe-to-toe	in	the	center	of	the	ring,
just	two	mad	dogs	beating	the	crap	out	of	each	other.
My	heart	is	pounding,	my	stomach	is	rolling,	and	I’m	just	the	water	boy.	We
assure	 Tadeo	 he’s	 won	 again	 as	 we	 wait	 and	 wait.	 Finally,	 the	 referee	 walks	 the
fighters	to	the	center	of	the	ring.	The	announcer	proclaims	a	split	decision,	with

Crush	winning	by	a	point.	A	thunderous	wave	of	booing	and	screaming	rocks	the
auditorium.	 Tadeo	 is	 stunned,	 shocked,	 his	 mouth	 wide	 open,	 his	 swollen	 eyes
filled	with	hate.	The	fans	are	throwing	things	at	the	cage	and	we’re	on	the	verge	of
a	riot.
The	next	fifteen	seconds	will	change	Tadeo’s	life	forever.
He	suddenly	whirls	and	throws	a	hard	right	into	the	left	side	of	Crush’s	face.
It’s	 a	 sucker	 punch,	 a	 vicious	 one	 that	 Crush	 never	 saw	 coming.	 He	 crumples	 to
the	 mat,	 out	 cold.	 Instantly,	 Tadeo	 attacks	 the	 referee,	 who’s	 also	 black,	 and
pummels	 him	 with	 a	 flurry.	 The	 ref	 stumbles	 and	 lands	 against	 the	 cage,	 half
sitting	up,	and	Tadeo	pounces	on	him	with	a	furious	barrage	of	punches.	For	a	few
seconds,	everyone	is	too	stunned	to	react.	They	are,	after	all,	in	a	cage,	and	it	takes
time	 to	 mount	 a	 rescue.	 By	 the	 time	 Norberto	 tackles	 Tadeo,	 the	 poor	 ref	 is
unconscious.
The	auditorium	erupts	as	fights	break	out	everywhere.	Tadeo’s	fans,	most	of
them	 Hispanic,	 and	 Crush’s	 fans,	 most	 of	 whom	 are	 black	 and	 heavily
outnumbered,	attack	each	other	like	gangs	in	the	street.	Cups	of	beer	and	cartons
of	popcorn	rain	down	like	confetti.	A	security	guard	nearby	gets	hit	over	the	head
with	a	folding	chair.	It’s	total	chaos	and	no	one	is	safe.	I	forget	about	the	carnage
inside	the	cage	and	sprint	for	my	son.	He’s	not	in	his	seat,	but	through	the	melee	I
see	the	hulking	figure	of	Partner	as	they	make	their	escape.	I	go	after	them,	and
within	seconds	we	are	safe.	As	we	duck	out	of	the	auditorium,	we	pass	panicked
police	running	toward	the	action.	In	the	van,	I	clutch	Starcher	in	the	front	seat	as
Partner	takes	the	side	streets.	I	say,	“Are	you	okay,	bud?”
He	says,	“Let’s	do	it	again.”
Minutes	later,	we	enter	my	apartment	and	take	a	deep	breath.	I	get	drinks—
beers	for	Partner	and	me	and	a	soda	for	Starcher—and	we	turn	on	the	local	news.
The	 story	 is	 still	 unfolding	 and	 the	 reporters	 are	 frantic.	 The	 kid	 is	 excited	 and
talks	 enough	 to	 let	 me	 know	 he’s	 not	 traumatized.	 I	 try	 in	 vain	 to	 explain	 what
happened.
Partner	sleeps	on	the	sofa.	I	wake	him	at	4:00	a.m.	to	talk	strategy.	He	leaves
for	the	city	jail,	to	try	and	find	Tadeo,	and	for	the	hospital,	to	dig	for	information
about	 the	 referee.	 I	 can’t	 shake	 the	 image	 of	 Tadeo	 pounding	 the	 guy’s	 face.	 He
was	 knocked	 cold	 from	 the	 first	 punch	 and	 there	 were	 dozens	 afterward,	 all
delivered	by	a	man	completely	out	of	his	mind.	I	try	not	to	think	about	what’s	next
for	my	fighter.
I	grind	beans,	and	while	the	coffee	is	brewing	I	go	online	to	check	the	news.
Fortunately,	 no	 one	 has	 died	 yet,	 but	 at	 least	 twenty	 people	 are	 in	 the	 hospital.
Rescue	personnel	are	still	on	the	scene.	And	the	blame	is	being	heaped	upon	one
Tadeo	 Zapate,	 age	 twenty-two,	 an	 up-and-coming	 cage	 fighter	 who’s	 now	 locked
away	in	the	city	jail.
Judith	calls	at	6:30	to	check	on	her	son.	She’s	hours	away	and	knows	nothing

about	the	riot	we	survived.	I	ask	about	her	college	roommate.	She	is	surviving	but
things	look	bad.	Judith	will	be	home	tomorrow,	Sunday,	and	I	assure	her	the	kid
will	be	just	fine.	All	is	well.
With	some	luck,	she’ll	never	know.
Luck,	though,	is	not	going	my	way.	A	few	minutes	after	our	brief	chat,	I	check
the	Chronicle	online.	The	late	edition	managed	to	catch	the	breaking	story	down
at	 the	 old	 auditorium,	 and	 on	 the	 front	 page	 is	 a	 rather	 large	 color	 photo	 of	 two
people	 racing	 toward	 an	 exit.	 One	 is	 Partner,	 and	 he’s	 holding	 a	 kid.	 Starcher
seems	to	be	staring	at	the	photographer,	as	if	posing	for	the	shot.	Their	names	are
not	 given;	 there	 was	 no	 time	 to	 ask.	 But	 to	 those	 who	 know	 him,	 his	 identity	 is
indisputable.
How	long	before	one	of	Judith’s	friends	sees	the	photo	and	gives	her	a	call?
How	long	before	she	opens	her	laptop	and	sees	for	herself?	While	I	wait,	I	turn	on
the	television	and	go	to	SportsCenter.	The	story	is	irresistible	because	it’s	all	right
there,	on	video,	blow	by	blow	by	blow.	I	get	sick	watching	it	again	and	again.
Partner	 calls	 from	 the	 hospital	 with	 the	 news	 that	 the	 referee,	 a	 guy	 named
Sean	 King,	 is	 still	 in	 surgery.	 It’s	 no	 surprise	 that	 Partner	 is	 not	 the	 only	 person
sniffing	around	the	corridors	waiting	for	any	bit	of	news.	He’s	heard	of	“massive
head	 wounds,”	 but	 has	 no	 details.	 He’s	 already	 been	 to	 the	 jail,	 where	 a	 contact
confirmed	that	Mr.	Zapate	is	safely	locked	away	and	not	receiving	visitors.
At	 8:00	 a.m.,	 our	 blundering	 chief	 of	 police	 decides	 the	 world	 should	 hear
from	him.	He	arranges	a	press	conference,	one	of	those	little	muscle	pageants	in
which	a	thick	wall	of	uniformed	white	men	line	up	behind	the	chief	and	scowl	at
the	reporters	while	acting	as	though	they	really	don’t	want	to	be	seen.	For	thirty
minutes	 the	 chief	 talks	 and	 answers	 questions	 and	 reveals	 not	 a	 single	 fact	 that
wasn’t	 posted	 online	 two	 hours	 earlier.	 He’s	 obviously	 enjoying	 the	 moment
because	 nothing	 can	 be	 blamed	 on	 him	 or	 his	 men.	 Just	 as	 I’m	 getting	 bored,
Judith	calls.
The	conversation	is	predictable—tense,	bitchy,	and	accusatory.	She’s	seen	the
front-page	photo	of	her	son	escaping	the	melee	and	she	wants	answers,	and	now,
dammit.	I	assure	her	our	son	is	sleeping	soundly	and	probably	dreaming	of	a	fine
day	with	his	father.	She	says	she’s	catching	an	early	flight	and	will	be	in	the	City	by
5:00	p.m.,	which	is	the	precise	moment	I’m	supposed	to	meet	her	in	the	park	and
hand	 him	 over.	 She’ll	 file	 papers	 first	 thing	 Monday	 morning	 to	 terminate	 all
visitation	 rights.	 File	 away,	 I	 say,	 because	 it	 won’t	 work.	 No	 judge	 in	 town	 will
totally	exclude	me	from	seeing	my	son	once	a	month.	And,	who	knows,	maybe	the
judge	we	draw	is	a	fan	of	cage	fighting.	She	curses	and	I	curse	back	and	we	finally
get	off	the	phone.
Looks	like	we’ve	just	begun	to	fight.

11.
The	Sunday	papers	rage	against	cage	fighting,	with	knee-jerk	condemnations
coming	from	all	directions.	The	Internet	burns	with	the	story.	A	YouTube	video	of
the	 attack	 on	 the	 referee	 has	 four	 million	 hits	 before	 noon,	 and	 Tadeo	 has
instantly	become	the	most	famous	cage	fighter	in	the	world,	though	he	will	never
fight	 again.	 Slowly,	 the	 wounded	 are	 released	 from	 hospitals,	 and,	 fortunately,
there	 were	 no	 serious	 injuries	 to	 the	 fans.	 Just	 a	 bunch	 of	 drunks	 throwing
punches	and	launching	chairs.	Sean	King	remains	in	a	coma,	in	serious	condition.
Crush	is	resting	comfortably	with	a	badly	fractured	jaw	and	a	concussion.
Late	 in	 the	 afternoon,	 I	 am	 allowed	 to	 visit	 my	 client	 in	 one	 of	 the	 jail’s
attorney	rooms.	He’s	sitting	on	the	other	side	of	a	thick	metal	screen	when	I	walk
in	and	take	a	seat.	His	face	is	cut	and	badly	swollen	from	the	fight,	but	that’s	the
least	of	his	problems.	He	is	so	subdued	I	wonder	if	he’s	been	drugged.	We	chat	for
a	moment.
“When	can	I	get	outta	here?”	he	asks.
You’d	 better	 get	 used	 to	 it,	 I	 want	 to	 say.	 “Your	 first	 appearance	 is	 in	 the
morning,	in	court.	I’ll	be	there.	Nothing	much	will	happen.	They’ll	wait	to	see	what
happens	with	the	referee.	If	he	dies,	then	you’re	really	up	shit	creek.	If	he	recovers,
they’ll	charge	you	with	a	bunch	of	stuff	but	it	won’t	be	murder.	Maybe	in	a	week	or
so	 we’ll	 go	 back	 to	 court	 and	 request	 a	 reasonable	 bond.	 I	 can’t	 guess	 what	 the
judge	will	do.	So,	to	answer	your	question,	there’s	a	chance	you	might	bond	out	in
a	few	days.	There’s	an	even	better	chance	you’ll	stay	in	jail	until	a	trial.”
“How	long	will	that	take?”
“A	trial?”
“Yes.”
“Hard	to	say.	Six	months	at	the	earliest;	probably	more	like	a	year.	The	trial
itself	won’t	last	very	long	because	there	won’t	be	many	witnesses.	They’ll	just	roll
the	video.”
He	looks	down,	as	if	he	wants	to	cry.	I	love	this	kid	but	there’s	not	much	I	can
do	for	him,	now	or	in	six	months.	“Do	you	remember	it?”	I	ask.
Slowly,	he	begins	to	nod.	He	says,	“I	just	snapped.	They	cheated	me	out	of	a
clear	 win.	 The	 ref	 made	 me	 fight	 his	 way,	 not	 mine.	 The	 ref	 kept	 getting	 in	 the
way,	you	know,	man,	I	just	couldn’t	fight	my	fight.	I	mean,	I	didn’t	want	to	hurt
the	ref,	but	I	just	snapped.	I	was	so	angry,	so	destroyed	when	he	raised	that	guy’s
hand.	I	kicked	his	ass,	didn’t	I?”
“Crush	or	the	referee?”
“Come	on,	man.	Crush.	I	kicked	his	ass,	right?”

“No,	you	did	not.	But	you	won	the	fight.”	I	saw	every	second	of	the	fight	and	I
never	 felt	 as	 though	 the	 ref	 was	 in	 the	 way.	 As	 far	 as	 legal	 defenses	 go,	 I	 don’t
think	much	of	this	one:	The	ref	held	me	back,	cost	me	the	match,	so	I	caved	in	his
face.	It	was	justified.
“They	took	it	away	from	me,”	he	says.
“The	referee	is	not	a	judge,	Tadeo.	The	three	judges	did	the	scoring.	You	went
after	the	wrong	guy.”
He	 picks	 at	 the	 stitches	 in	 his	 forehead	 and	 says,	 “I	 know,	 I	 know.	 I	 did
wrong,	Sebastian,	but	you	gotta	do	something,	okay?”
“You	know	I’ll	do	everything	possible.”
“Will	I	serve	some	time?”
You’re	serving	it	now;	get	used	to	it.	I’ve	already	played	with	the	numbers.	If
Sean	 King	 dies,	 I’m	 thinking	 twenty	 years	 for	 second-degree	 murder,	 maybe
fifteen	for	manslaughter.	If	he	lives,	three	to	five	for	aggravated	assault.	Since	I’m
not	ready	to	share	these	thoughts,	I	punt	by	saying,	“Let’s	worry	about	that	later.”
“Probably	so,	right?”
“Probably	so.”
There	 is	 a	 gap	 in	 the	 conversation	 as	 we	 hear	 doors	 clanging	 in	 the
background.	 A	 jailer	 yells	 an	 obscenity.	 A	 tear	 emerges	 through	 Tadeo’s	 swollen
left	 eye	 and	 runs	 down	 his	 bruised	 cheek.	 “I	 can’t	 believe	 it,	 man.	 I	 just	 can’t
believe	it.”	His	voice	is	soft	and	pained.
If	you	can’t	believe	it,	think	about	that	poor	ref	and	his	family.	“I	need	to	run,
Tadeo.	I’ll	see	you	in	the	morning,	in	court.”
“I	gotta	wear	this	in	court?”	he	asks,	tugging	at	his	orange	jumpsuit.
“Afraid	so.	It’s	just	a	first	appearance.”

12.
At	9:00	on	Monday	morning,	I’m	in	a	busy	courtroom	with	a	bunch	of	other
defense	 lawyers	 and	 prosecutors.	 In	 one	 corner	 there	 is	 a	 collection	 of	 shadylooking	men	in	orange	jumpsuits,	all	handcuffed	together	and	watched	by	armed
bailiffs.	These	are	the	new	arrestees,	and	this	is	their	second	stop	on	the	judicial
assembly	line.	The	first	stop	being	the	jail.	One	by	one	their	names	are	called,	and
after	being	uncuffed	they	saunter	over	to	a	spot	in	front	of	the	bench,	upon	which
sits	a	judge,	one	of	twenty	in	our	system	who	handles	the	preliminary	matters.	The
judge	 asks	 them	 some	 questions,	 the	 most	 important	 being	 “Do	 you	 have	 a
lawyer?”	 Very	 few	 of	 them	 do,	 and	 the	 judge	 then	 assigns	 them	 to	 the	 public
defender’s	 office.	 A	 rookie	 will	 pop	 up,	 stand	 beside	 his	 new	 client,	 and	 tell	 him
not	to	say	anything	else.	Dates	will	be	set	for	return	visits.
Tadeo	Zapate,	though,	has	a	lawyer.	They	call	his	name	and	we	meet	in	front
of	 the	 bench.	 His	 face	 looks	 even	 worse.	 Most	 of	 the	 hushed	 conversations	 stop
when	 the	 crowd	 realizes	 this	 is	 the	 guy	 everyone	 is	 talking	 about,	 the	 promising
mixed	martial	arts	fighter	who	is	now	the	YouTube	star.
“Are	 you	 Tadeo	 Zapate?”	 the	 judge	 asks	 with	 interest,	 the	 first	 time	 this
morning	he’s	seemed	engaged.
“Yes,	sir.”
“And	I	assume	Mr.	Sebastian	Rudd	is	your	lawyer.”
“Yes,	sir.”
An	assistant	prosecutor	eases	behind	him.
The	judge	continues,	“You	are	charged,	at	this	point,	with	aggravated	assault.
Do	you	understand	this?”
“Yes,	sir.”
“Mr.	Rudd,	have	you	explained	to	your	client	that	the	charges	might	change	to
something	more	serious?”
“Yes,	sir,	he	understands.”
“By	 the	 way,	 what	 is	 the	 latest	 on	 the	 referee?”	 he	 asks	 the	 assistant
prosecutor,	as	if	the	guy	were	the	treating	physician.
“Last	I	heard,	Mr.	King’s	condition	is	still	critical.”
“Very	well,”	His	Honor	says.	“Let’s	meet	back	here	in	a	week	and	see	where
things	stand.	Until	then,	Mr.	Rudd,	we	won’t	discuss	the	matter	of	bail.”
“Sure,	Judge,”	I	say.
We	 are	 dismissed.	 As	 Tadeo	 walks	 away,	 I	 whisper,	 “I’ll	 see	 you	 at	 the	 jail

tomorrow.”
“Thanks,”	he	says,	then	looks	at	the	spectators	and	nods	at	his	mother,	who’s
sitting	 with	 an	 entire	 pack	 of	 crying	 relatives.	 She	 emigrated	 from	 El	 Salvador
twenty-five	years	ago,	has	her	green	card,	works	a	late	shift	in	a	cafeteria,	and	is
raising	a	flock	of	children,	grandchildren,	and	other	assorted	relatives.	Tadeo	and
his	cage	skills	were	her	ticket	to	a	better	life.	Miguel	holds	her	hand	and	whispers
in	Spanish.	He’s	been	chewed	up	by	our	judicial	system	a	few	times	and	knows	the
score.
I	 speak	 to	 them	 briefly,	 assure	 them	 I’m	 doing	 whatever	 can	 be	 done,	 then
walk	with	them	out	of	the	courtroom	and	into	a	hallway	where	some	reporters	are
waiting,	two	with	cameras.	This	is	what	I	live	for.

13.
Quite	the	busy	morning.	While	I’m	in	court	with	Tadeo,	Judith	does	exactly	as
she	promised	and	files	a	nasty	motion	to	terminate	all	of	my	visitation	rights,	even
the	three	hours	I	get	on	Christmas	Eve	and	the	two	hours	on	my	son’s	birthday.
She	 claims	 I’m	 an	 unfit	 parent,	 a	 danger	 to	 his	 physical	 safety,	 and	 a	 “horrible
influence”	 on	 the	 child’s	 life.	 She	 demands	 an	 expedited	 hearing.	 Such	 theatrics.
As	if	the	kid	were	in	danger.
Harry	 &	 Harry	 prepare	 a	 vicious	 response,	 and	 I	 file	 it	 Monday	 afternoon.
Once	again,	we	square	off	in	her	ongoing	crusade	to	teach	me	valuable	lessons.	No
judge	will	grant	her	demands,	and	she	knows	it.	But	she’s	doing	it	because	she’s
angry	and	she	thinks	that	if	she	drags	me	through	the	meat	grinder	once	more	I’ll
finally	 surrender	 and	 get	 out	 of	 their	 lives.	 I’m	 almost	 looking	 forward	 to	 the
hearing.
First,	 though,	 we	 have	 another	 problem.	 On	 Wednesday,	 she	 calls	 my	 cell
around	noon	and	announces	rudely,	“We	have	a	meeting	at	school	this	afternoon.”
Oh	 really?	 This	 is	 maybe	 the	 second	 time	 I’ve	 been	 asked	 to	 show	 up	 at	 the
school	and	act	like	a	parent.	Until	now,	Judith	has	done	a	fine	job	of	keeping	me
out	of	our	son’s	business.
I	ask,	“Okay,	what’s	up?”
“Starcher	is	in	trouble.	He	got	in	a	fight	at	school,	punched	another	kid.”
I	 am	 overwhelmed	 with	 fatherly	 pride	 and	 I	 almost	 laugh.	 But	 I	 bite	 my
tongue	and	say,	“Oh,	gosh,	what	happened?”	I	want	to	add	questions	such	as	“Did
he	 win?”	 “How	 many	 times	 did	 he	 punch	 him?”	 and	 “Was	 the	 other	 kid	 a	 third
grader?”	But	I	manage	to	control	my	excitement.
“That’s	 what	 the	 meeting	 is	 all	 about.	 I’ll	 see	 you	 in	 the	 principal’s	 office	 at
four.”
“Four,	today?”
“Yes,”	she	says,	bitchy	and	firm.
“Okay.”	I’ll	have	to	move	a	court	appearance	but	it’s	no	problem.	I	wouldn’t
miss	this	meeting	for	the	world.	My	kid—a	soft	little	boy	who’s	never	had	a	chance
to	be	tough—punched	somebody!
I	 smile	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 school.	 The	 principal	 has	 a	 big	 office	 with	 several
chairs	 around	 a	 coffee	 table.	 We	 meet	 there,	 very	 casual.	 Her	 name	 is	 Doris—a
frazzled	 veteran	 of	 at	 least	 forty	 years	 in	 public	 education.	 But	 she	 has	 an	 easy
smile	 and	 a	 comforting	 voice.	 Who	 knows	 how	 many	 meetings	 like	 this	 she’s
suffered	 through.	 Judith	 and	 Ava	 are	 already	 there	 when	 I	 arrive.	 I	 nod	 at	 them
without	 speaking.	 Judith	 is	 wearing	 a	 designer	 dress	 and	 is	 stunning.	 Ava,	 the

former	lingerie	model,	is	wearing	supertight	leather	pants	and	a	tight	blouse.	She
may	have	the	brains	of	a	gerbil	but	she	still	has	a	body	that	belongs	on	magazine
covers.	Both	women	look	fabulous,	and	it’s	obvious,	at	least	to	me,	that	they	spent
some	time	dressing	up	for	this	occasion.	But	why?
Then	Ms.	Tarrant	arrives,	and	things	become	clearer.	She’s	Starcher’s	teacher,
a	 thirty-three-year-old	 knockout	 who	 got	 a	 divorce	 recently	 and,	 according	 to	 a
source,	 is	 already	 back	 in	 the	 game.	 She	 has	 short	 blond	 hair,	 cut	 smartly,	 and
large	 brown	 eyes	 that	 force	 everyone	 she	 meets	 to	 do	 at	 least	 one	 double	 take.
Judith	and	Ava	are	no	longer	the	hottest	babes	in	the	room.	In	fact,	they’re	getting
smoked.	 I	 stand	 and	 make	 a	 fuss	 over	 Ms.	 Tarrant,	 who	 enjoys	 the	 attention.
Judith	 immediately	 goes	 into	 total-bitch	 mode—she’s	 halfway	 there	 by	 nature—
but	Ava’s	eyes	sort	of	linger	when	she	looks	at	the	teacher.	Mine	are	lingering	like
crazy.
Doris	 gives	 us	 the	 basics:	 During	 recess	 yesterday	 afternoon,	 some	 secondgrade	 boys	 were	 playing	 kickball	 on	 the	 playground.	 There	 were	 words,	 then	 a
scuffle,	then	a	boy	named	Brad	pushed	Starcher,	who	then	smacked	Brad	on	the
mouth.	 It	 caused	 a	 slight	 cut,	 thus	 blood,	 thus	 it’s	 a	 major	 incident.	 Not
surprisingly,	 the	 boys	 clammed	 up	 when	 the	 teachers	 arrived	 and	 haven’t	 said
much.
I	blurt	out,	“Sounds	pretty	harmless.	Just	boys	being	boys.”
None	 of	 the	 four	 women	 agree,	 not	 that	 I	 expect	 them	 to.	 Ms.	 Tarrant	 says,
“One	of	the	boys	told	me	that	Brad	was	making	fun	of	Starcher	because	his	picture
was	in	the	newspaper.”
“Who	threw	the	first	punch?”	I	ask,	almost	rudely.
They	 squirm	 and	 don’t	 like	 the	 question.	 “Does	 that	 really	 matter?”	 Judith
shoots	back.
“Damn	right	it	does.”
Sensing	 trouble,	 Doris	 rushes	 in	 with	 “We	 have	 strict	 rules	 against	 fighting,
Mr.	Rudd,	regardless	of	who	starts	the	altercation.	Our	students	are	taught	not	to
engage	in	this	type	of	activity.”
“I	 get	 that,	 but	 you	 can’t	 expect	 a	 kid	 to	 get	 bullied	 without	 standing	 up	 for
himself.”
The	word	“bullied”	is	a	hot	one.	With	my	kid	now	the	victim,	they’re	not	sure
how	to	respond.	Ms.	Tarrant	says,	“Well,	I’m	not	sure	he	was	being	bullied.”
“Is	Brad	a	bad	apple?”	I	ask	the	teacher.
“No,	he	certainly	is	not.	I	have	a	great	group	of	kids	this	year.”
“Sure	 you	 do.	 Including	 mine.	 These	 are	 little	 boys,	 okay?	 They	 can’t	 hurt
each	other.	So	they	push	and	shove	on	the	playground.	They	are	boys,	dammit!	Let
them	be	boys.	Don’t	punish	them	every	time	they	disagree.”

“We’re	teaching	them	lessons,	Mr.	Rudd,”	Doris	says	piously.
Judith	snarls,	“Have	you	talked	to	him	about	fighting?”
“Yes	 I	 have.	 I’ve	 told	 him	 that	 fighting	 is	 wrong,	 never	 start	 a	 fight,	 but	 if
someone	else	happens	to	start	one,	then	by	all	means	protect	himself.	And	what,
exactly,	is	wrong	with	that?”
None	of	the	four	take	a	crack	at	answering	this,	so	I	shove	on.	“You’d	better
teach	him	now	to	stand	up	for	himself,	or	he’ll	get	bullied	for	the	rest	of	his	life.
These	 are	 kids.	 They’ll	 fight.	 They’ll	 win	 some,	 lose	 some,	 but	 they’ll	 outgrow	 it.
Believe	 me,	 when	 a	 boy	 gets	 older	 and	 gets	 punched	 a	 few	 times,	 he	 loses	 his
enthusiasm	for	fighting.”
For	the	second	time,	I	catch	Ava	glancing	at	Ms.	Tarrant’s	legs.	I’m	glancing
too;	can’t	help	it.	They	deserve	a	lot	of	attention.	Doris	is	watching	these	mating
rituals.	She’s	seen	it	all	before.
She	says,	“Brad’s	parents	are	quite	upset.”
I	 jump	 in	 with	 “Then	 I’ll	 be	 happy	 to	 talk	 to	 them,	 to	 apologize	 and	 to	 have
Starcher	apologize	too.	How	about	that?”
“I’ll	handle	this,”	Judith	barks.
“Then	why	did	you	invite	me	to	this	little	party?	I’ll	tell	you	why.	You	want	to
make	sure	all	blame	is	properly	laid	at	my	feet.	Five	days	ago	I	took	the	kid	to	the
cage	fights;	now	he’s	brawling	on	the	playground.	Clear	proof	it’s	all	my	fault.	You
win.	You	wanted	some	witnesses.	So	here	we	are.	Do	you	feel	better	now?”
This,	 of	 course,	 sucks	 the	 air	 out	 of	 the	 room.	 Judith’s	 eyes	 glaze	 over	 with
hatred	and	I	can	almost	see	steam	coming	out	of	her	ears.	Doris,	the	pro,	rushes	in
with	“Okay,	okay.	I	like	the	idea	of	one	of	you	having	a	chat	with	Brad’s	parents.”
“One	of	the	two	of	us,	or	one	of	the	three	of	us?”	I	ask.	What	a	smart-ass.	“I’m
sorry,	but	it	gets	kind	of	crowded.”
Ava	 shoots	 daggers	 at	 me.	 I	 glance	 at	 the	 teacher’s	 legs.	 What	 a	 ridiculous
meeting.
Doris	shows	some	spine	by	looking	at	me	and	saying,	“I	think	you	should	do
it.	You’re	right;	it’s	a	boy	thing.	Call	Brad’s	parents	and	apologize.”
“Done.”
“What’s	 the	 punishment	 for	 Starcher?”	 Ava	 asks	 because	 Judith	 can’t	 speak
right	now.
Doris	says,	“What	do	you	think,	Ms.	Tarrant?”
“Well,	there	has	to	be	a	punishment.”
I	make	matters	worse	by	saying,	“Don’t	tell	me	you’re	going	to	expel	the	kid.”
Ms.	 Tarrant	 says,	 “No,	 he	 and	 Brad	 are	 friends	 and	 I	 think	 they’ve	 already

moved	on.	What	about	a	week	with	no	recess?”
“Can	he	still	have	lunch?”	I	ask,	just	trying	to	clog	the	wheels	of	justice.	I’m	a
lawyer;	it’s	instinctive.
She	smiles	but	ignores	this.	We	hammer	out	an	agreement	and	I’m	the	first
one	to	leave.	As	I	drive	away	from	the	parking	lot,	I	realize	I’m	smiling.	Starcher
stood	his	ground!
Late	that	night,	I	e-mail	Ms.	Tarrant—Naomi	is	her	first	name—and	thank	her
for	doing	such	a	fine	job.	Ten	minutes	later,	she	e-mails	me	back	and	says	thanks.
I	fire	right	back	and	ask	her	to	dinner.	Twenty	minutes	later	she	informs	me	it’s
not	a	good	idea	to	date	parents	of	her	kids.	In	other	words,	not	now,	maybe	in	the
future.
It’s	 Wednesday	 and	 raining.	 We’ve	 played	 Dirty	 Golf	 many	 times	 in	 bad
weather,	but	Alan	said	no	tonight;	no	more	ruts	in	the	fairways.	Old	Rico	is	closed
for	 the	 evening.	 I’m	 wide	 awake,	 bored,	 worried	 about	 Tadeo	 and	 Doug	 Renfro,
and	I’m	also	fairly	revved	up	at	the	slim	prospects	of	chasing	Ms.	Tarrant.	Sleep
eludes	 me,	 again,	 so	 I	 grab	 an	 umbrella	 and	 hustle	 down	 to	 The	 Rack.	 At
midnight,	I’m	losing	ten	bucks	a	game	in	nine	ball	to	a	kid	who	looks	no	more	than
fifteen.	I	asked	him	if	he	goes	to	school,	to	which	he	answered,	“Occasionally.”
Curly	 is	 watching	 us,	 and	 at	 one	 point	 whispers	 to	 me,	 “Never	 seen	 him
before.	 Amazing.”	 Mercifully,	 Curly	 closes	 the	 place	 at	 1:00	 a.m.	 The	 kid	 has
picked	my	pockets	for	$90.	I’ll	avoid	him	next	time.	At	2:00,	I	manage	to	close	my
eyes	and	fall	asleep.

14.
Partner	 calls	 me	 at	 four.	 Sean	 King	 died	 of	 a	 cerebral	 hemorrhage.	 I	 make
coffee	and	drink	it	in	the	dark	while	gazing	down	on	the	City,	still	and	quiet	at	this
hour.	The	moon	is	full	and	its	light	reflects	off	the	tall	buildings	downtown.
What	a	tragedy.	Tadeo	Zapate	will	now	spend	at	least	the	next	decade	or	so
behind	bars.	He’s	twenty-two,	so	he’ll	be	too	old	to	fight	when	he	gets	out.	Too	old
for	 many	 things.	 I	 think	 about	 the	 money,	 but	 just	 for	 a	 minute.	 I	 invested
$30,000	in	the	kid	for	a	quarter	share	of	his	career	earnings,	which	to	date	total
about	 $80,000.	 Plus,	 I’ve	 picked	 up	 another	 $20,000	 betting	 on	 him.	 So	 I’m
slightly	ahead	on	the	cash	side.	I	try	not	to	think	about	his	future	earnings,	which
were	going	to	be	substantial.	All	that	seems	trivial	now.
Instead,	I	think	about	his	family,	their	hard	life	and	the	hope	he	gave	them.
He	was	their	ticket	out	of	the	street	life	and	the	violence,	to	the	middle	class	and
beyond.	Now	they’ll	sink	even	deeper	into	poverty	while	he	rots	away	in	prison.
There	 is	 no	 defense,	 no	 credible	 legal	 strategy	 to	 save	 him.	 I’ve	 watched	 the
video	 a	 hundred	 times	 now.	 The	 last	 flurry	 of	 blows	 to	 Sean	 King’s	 face	 were
absorbed	 while	 he	 was	 unconscious.	 It	 won’t	 be	 difficult	 to	 find	 an	 expert	 who’ll
say	 those	 were	 the	 shots	 that	 did	 the	 fatal	 damage.	 But	 an	 expert	 will	 not	 be
needed.	 This	 case	 is	 not	 going	 to	 trial.	 I’ll	 serve	 my	 client	 well	 if	 I	 can	 somehow
pressure	 the	 State	 to	 make	 us	 a	 decent	 offer.	 I	 just	 hope	 it’s	 ten	 years	 and	 not
thirty,	but	something	tells	me	I’m	dreaming.	No	prosecutor	in	this	country	would
pass	up	the	opportunity	to	nail	such	a	high-profile	murderer.
I	force	myself	to	think	about	Sean	King,	but	I	never	knew	the	guy.	I’m	sure	his
family	is	devastated	and	all	that,	but	my	thoughts	return	to	Tadeo.
At	six	I	shower,	get	dressed,	and	head	for	the	jail.	I	have	to	tell	Tadeo	that	his
life,	as	he	knew	it,	is	over.

15.
The	following	Monday,	Tadeo	Zapate	and	I	appear	in	court	again,	though	the
mood	is	quite	different.	He’s	charged	with	murder	now,	and	thanks	to	the	Internet
he’s	famous.	It	seems	as	though	few	people	can	resist	the	temptation	of	watching
him	kill	Sean	King	with	his	bare	hands.
As	 expected,	 the	 judge	 denies	 bail	 and	 they	 take	 Tadeo	 away.	 I’ve	 had	 two
brief	 chats	 with	 the	 prosecutor	 and	 it	 looks	 like	 they’re	 out	 for	 blood.	 Seconddegree	 murder	 carries	 a	 max	 of	 thirty	 years.	 For	 a	 plea,	 they’ll	 agree	 to	 twenty.
Under	our	screwed-up	parole	system,	he’ll	serve	at	least	ten.	I	have	yet	to	explain
this	to	my	client.	He’s	still	in	denial,	still	in	that	fog	where	he’s	sorry	it	happened,
can’t	explain	it,	but	still	believing	that	a	good	lawyer	can	pull	some	strings	and	get
him	off.
It’s	a	sad	day,	but	not	a	complete	waste.	In	the	large	open	hallway	outside	the
courtroom,	 there	 is	 a	 crowd	 of	 reporters	 and	 they’re	 waiting	 for	 me.	 There	 is	 no
gag	 order	 yet,	 so	 I’m	 free	 to	 say	 all	 the	 ridiculous	 things	 that	 lawyers	 say	 long
before	the	trials.	My	client	is	a	good	person	who	snapped	when	he	got	a	raw	deal.
Now	 he	 is	 devastated	 by	 what	 happened.	 He	 cries	 in	 sympathy	 for	 the	 family	 of
Sean	King.	He	would	give	anything	to	have	those	few	precious	seconds	back.	We
will	 mount	 a	 vigorous	 defense.	 Yes,	 of	 course,	 he	 hopes	 to	 fight	 again.	 He	 was
helping	his	poor	mother	support	her	family	and	a	house	full	of	relatives.
And	so	on.

16.
With	 Harry	 &	 Harry	 churning	 out	 the	 paperwork,	 and	 with	 Judge	 Samson
haranguing	the	City’s	lawyers	whenever	they	get	close	to	his	courtroom,	the	civil
action	moved	ahead	at	an	unusually	rapid	pace.
We	 are	 in	 a	 race	 here,	 one	 that	 we	 will	 not	 win.	 I	 would	 love	 to	 try	 Doug
Renfro’s	 civil	 case	 in	 a	 packed	 courtroom	 before	 his	 criminal	 case	 is	 called.	 The
problem	 is	 that	 we	 have	 a	 speedy-trial	 rule	 in	 criminal	 cases,	 but	 not	 in	 civil.	 In
theory,	 a	 criminal	 case	 must	 be	 brought	 to	 trial	 or	 otherwise	 disposed	 of	 within
120	days	of	indictment,	though	this	is	routinely	waived	by	the	defendant’s	lawyer
because	more	time	is	needed	to	prepare.	There	is	no	such	rule	in	civil	cases,	which
often	drag	on	for	years.	In	my	perfect	scenario,	we	would	try	the	civil	case	first,	get
a	 huge	 verdict	 that	 would	 be	 front-page	 news	 and,	 more	 important,	 influence
prospective	jurors	in	the	criminal	case.	The	press	can’t	get	enough	of	the	Renfro
debacle,	 and	 I	 relish	 the	 chance	 to	 grill	 the	 cops	 on	 the	 witness	 stand	 for	 the
benefit	of	the	entire	city.
If	 the	 criminal	 prosecution	 goes	 first,	 and	 if	 Doug	 Renfro	 is	 convicted,	 then
the	civil	case	will	be	much	more	difficult	to	win.	As	a	witness,	he’ll	be	impeachable
because	of	his	conviction.
Judge	Samson	understands	this	and	is	trying	to	help.	Less	than	three	months
after	the	botched	SWAT	raid,	he	orders	all	eight	cops	to	appear	in	his	chambers	to
be	deposed	by	me.	No	judge,	federal	or	otherwise,	would	ever	consider	suffering
through	a	single	deposition;	it	would	be	far	beneath	his	or	her	dignity.	But	to	set
the	mood	and	deliver	the	message	to	the	cops	and	their	lawyers	that	he	is	highly
suspicious	of	them,	Judge	Samson	orders	the	depositions	to	be	taken	on	his	turf,
with	his	law	clerk	and	his	magistrate	in	the	room.
It	is	a	brutal	marathon	that	pushes	me	to	the	limits.	I	begin	with	Lieutenant
Chip	 Sumerall,	 the	 leader	 of	 the	 SWAT	 team.	 I	 elicit	 testimony	 regarding	 his
experience,	training,	and	participation	in	other	home	invasions.	I	am	deliberately
dull,	 tedious,	 poker-faced.	 It’s	 just	 a	 deposition,	 the	 purpose	 of	 which	 is	 to
establish	sworn	testimony.	Using	maps,	photos,	and	videos,	we	walk	through	the
Renfro	affair	for	hours.
It	takes	six	full	days	to	depose	the	eight	cops.	But	they’re	on	the	record	now,
and	they	cannot	change	their	stories	at	either	the	criminal	or	the	civil	trials.

17.
The	only	time	I	spend	in	Domestic	Relations	Court	is	when	I’m	dragged	in	to
account	for	my	sins.	I	wouldn’t	handle	a	divorce	or	adoption	at	gunpoint.	Judith,
though,	makes	her	living	in	the	gutter	warfare	of	divorce	trials	and	this	is	her	turf.
His	Honor	today	is	one	Stanley	Leef,	a	cranky	old	veteran	who	lost	interest	years
ago.	Judith	represents	herself,	as	do	I.	For	the	occasion	she’s	dragged	in	Ava,	who
sits	as	the	lone	spectator,	in	a	skirt	so	short	you	can	see	her	name	and	address.	I
catch	Judge	Leef	gazing	at	her,	enjoying	the	scenery.
Since	 we’re	 both	 lawyers,	 and	 representing	 ourselves,	 Judge	 Leef	 dispenses
with	the	formalities	and	allows	us	to	just	sit	and	talk,	as	if	we’re	in	arbitration.	We
are	on	the	record,	though,	and	a	stenographer	is	taking	it	all	down.
Judith	goes	first,	states	the	facts,	and	makes	it	sound	as	though	I’m	the	worst
parent	in	history	because	I	took	my	son	to	the	cage	fights.	Then,	four	days	later,
Starcher	 got	 in	 his	 first	 fight	 at	 school.	 Clear	 proof	 that	 I’ve	 turned	 him	 into	 a
monster.
Judge	Leef	frowns	as	if	this	is	just	awful.
With	 as	 much	 drama	 as	 she	 can	 muster,	 Judith	 proclaims	 that	 all	 visitation
rights	 should	 be	 terminated	 so	 the	 kid	 will	 never	 again	 be	 subjected	 to	 my
influence.	Judge	Leef	shoots	me	a	quick	glance	that	says,	“Is	she	crazy?”
But	 we’re	 not	 here	 for	 justice,	 we’re	 here	 for	 a	 show.	 Judith	 is	 an	 angry
mother	and	she’s	once	again	dragged	me	into	court.	My	punishment	is	not	the	loss
of	visitation	rights;	rather,	it’s	just	the	hassle	of	dealing	with	her.	She	will	not	be
pushed	around!	She	will	protect	her	child	at	all	costs!
From	my	seat,	I	tell	my	side	of	the	story	without	embellishing	a	single	word.
She	produces	a	copy	of	the	newspaper,	with	“her	son”	on	the	front	page.	What
humiliation!	He	could	have	been	seriously	injured.	Judge	Leef	is	almost	asleep.
She	 produces	 an	 expert,	 a	 child	 psychologist.	 Dr.	 Salabar,	 female	 of	 course,
informs	 the	 court	 that	 she	 has	 interviewed	 Starcher,	 spent	 an	 entire	 hour	 with
him,	 talked	 about	 the	 cage	 fights	 and	 the	 playground	 “brawl,”	 and	 is	 now	 of	 the
opinion	 that	 the	 carnage	 he	 witnessed	 while	 under	 my	 supervision	 had	 a
detrimental	effect	on	him	and	encouraged	him	to	start	a	fight	of	his	own.	Judith
manages	to	string	this	testimony	out	until	Judge	Leef	is	practically	comatose.
On	cross-examination,	I	ask,	“Are	you	married?”
“Yes.”
“Do	you	have	a	son	or	sons?”
“Two	boys,	yes.”

“Did	you	ever	take	either	son	to	boxing	matches,	wrestling	matches,	or	cage
fights?”
“No.”
“Did	either	son	ever	get	into	a	fight	with	another	kid?”
“Well,	I’m	sure	they	did,	but	then	I	really	can’t	say.”
The	 fact	 that	 she	 won’t	 answer	 the	 question	 speaks	 volumes.	 Judge	 Leef
shakes	his	head.
“Did	your	boys	ever	get	into	a	fight	with	one	another?”
“I	don’t	recall.”
“You	 don’t	 recall?	 Were	 you	 a	 loving	 mother	 who	 gave	 your	 sons	 all	 the
attention	possible?”
“I’d	like	to	think	so.”
“So	you	were	there	for	them?”
“As	much	as	possible,	yes.”
“And	you	can’t	remember	a	single	time	when	one	of	them	got	into	a	fight?”
“Well,	no,	not	at	this	time.”
“What	 about	 some	 other	 time?	 Strike	 that.	 Nothing	 further.”	 I	 glance	 at	 the
judge	 and	 he’s	 frustrated.	 But	 things	 brighten	 up	 considerably	 when	 the	 next
witness	takes	the	stand.	It’s	Naomi	Tarrant,	Starcher’s	teacher,	and	she’s	wearing
a	 tight	 dress	 and	 stilettos.	 By	 the	 time	 she	 promises	 to	 tell	 the	 truth,	 old	 Judge
Leef	is	wide	awake.	So	am	I.
Schoolteachers	hate	to	get	dragged	into	custody	and	visitation	battles.	Naomi
is	 no	 exception,	 though	 she	 knows	 how	 to	 handle	 this	 situation.	 We’ve	 been
swapping	e-mails	for	a	month	now.	She	still	won’t	agree	to	dinner,	but	I’m	making
progress.	She	testifies	that	Starcher	had	never	shown	any	violent	tendencies	until
a	 few	 days	 after	 his	 first	 trip	 to	 the	 cage	 fights.	 She	 describes	 the	 playground
incident	without	referring	to	it	as	a	fight	or	a	brawl.	Just	a	couple	of	boys	who	had
a	misunderstanding.
Judith	calls	her	as	a	witness	not	to	help	in	her	search	for	the	truth	but	to	show
Naomi,	 as	 well	 as	 everyone	 else,	 that	 she	 has	 the	 power	 to	 drag	 them	 into	 court
and	bully	them.
On	cross,	I	get	Naomi	to	admit	that,	sooner	or	later,	almost	every	normal	boy
she	has	ever	taught	has	been	involved	in	some	type	of	scuffle	on	the	playground.
She’s	 on	 and	 off	 the	 witness	 stand	 in	 fifteen	 minutes,	 and	 when	 Judge	 Leef
dismisses	her	he	looks	a	bit	disappointed.
In	closing,	Judith	repeats	what’s	already	been	said	and	makes	a	strident	plea
to	terminate	all	visitation	rights.

Judge	Leef	stops	her	cold	with	“But	the	father	is	getting	only	thirty-six	hours
a	month.	That’s	not	very	much.”
“Thank	you,”	I	say.
“That’s	enough,”	Judith	scolds	me.
“Sorry.”
The	judge	looks	at	me	and	asks,	“Mr.	Rudd,	will	you	agree	to	keep	the	child
away	from	cage	fighting,	as	well	as	boxing	and	wrestling	matches?”
“Yes,	I	promise.”
“And	will	you	also	agree	to	teach	the	child	that	fighting	is	a	bad	way	to	settle
disputes?”
“Yes,	I	promise.”
He	glares	at	Judith	and	says,	“Your	petition	is	denied.	Anything	else?”
Judith	hesitates	for	a	second,	then	says,	“Well,	I’ll	just	have	to	appeal.”
“You	have	that	right,”	he	says	as	he	taps	his	gavel.	“This	hearing	is	over.”

18.
The	 criminal	 trial	 of	 Doug	 Renfro	 begins	 on	 a	 Monday	 morning,	 and	 the
courtroom	is	packed	with	potential	jurors.	As	they	are	processed	and	seated	by	the
courtroom	 bailiffs,	 the	 lawyers	 meet	 in	 the	 chambers	 of	 the	 Honorable	 Ryan
Ponder,	 a	 ten-year	 veteran	 of	 our	 circuit	 courts	 and	 one	 of	 our	 better	 presiding
judges.	As	always	on	the	first	day	of	a	significant	trial,	the	mood	is	tense;	everyone
is	on	edge.	The	lawyers	look	as	though	they	haven’t	slept	all	weekend.
We	sit	around	a	large	table	and	cover	some	preliminary	matters.	As	we	wrap
things	 up,	 Judge	 Ponder	 looks	 at	 me	 and	 says,	 “I	 want	 to	 get	 this	 straight,	 Mr.
Rudd.	 The	 State	 is	 offering	 a	 deal	 whereby	 your	 client	 pleads	 guilty	 to	 a	 lesser
charge,	a	ramped-up	misdemeanor,	and	gets	no	jail	time.	He	walks.	And	in	return,
he	 agrees	 to	 drop	 his	 civil	 suit	 against	 the	 City	 and	 all	 of	 the	 other	 defendants.
Correct?”
“That’s	correct,	sir.”
“And	he	is	saying	no	to	this	deal?”
“Correct.”
“Let’s	get	this	on	the	record.”
Doug	 Renfro	 is	 retrieved	 from	 a	 witness	 room	 and	 led	 into	 the	 judge’s
chambers.	 He	 is	 wearing	 a	 dark	 wool	 suit,	 white	 shirt,	 dark	 tie,	 and	 is	 dressed
better	than	anyone	in	the	room,	with	the	possible	exception	of	me.	He	stands	tall,
erect,	and	proud,	an	old	soldier	itching	for	a	fight.	It	has	been	ten	months	since	his
home	was	invaded	by	the	police,	and	though	he	has	aged	considerably,	his	wounds
have	healed	and	he	carries	himself	with	confidence.
Judge	 Ponder	 swears	 him	 to	 tell	 the	 truth.	 He	 says,	 “Now,	 Mr.	 Renfro,	 the
State	is	offering	you	a	deal,	a	plea	agreement.	It	is	in	writing.	Have	you	read	it	and
discussed	it	with	your	lawyer?”
“I	have,	yes,	sir.”
“And	you	realize	that	if	you	take	this	plea	agreement	you	will	avoid	this	trial,
walk	out	of	here	a	free	man,	and	never	worry	about	going	to	prison?”
“Yes,	 I	 understand	 that.	 But	 I	 will	 not	 plead	 guilty	 to	 anything.	 The	 police
broke	 into	 my	 home	 and	 killed	 my	 wife.	 They	 will	 not	 be	 charged	 and	 that	 is
wrong.	I’ll	take	my	chances	with	the	jury.”	He	glares	at	the	prosecutor,	gives	him	a
look	of	disgust,	and	returns	his	gaze	to	Judge	Ponder.
The	 prosecutor,	 a	 veteran	 named	 Chuck	 Finney,	 hides	 his	 face	 behind	 some
paperwork.	 Finney	 is	 not	 a	 bad	 guy	 and	 does	 not	 want	 to	 be	 where	 he	 is	 now
sitting.	His	problem	is	simple	and	obvious—an	eager-beaver	cop	got	wounded	in	a
botched	raid,	and	the	law,	in	black	and	white,	says	the	guy	who	shot	him	is	guilty.

It’s	a	bad	law	written	by	clueless	people,	and	now	Finney	is	compelled	to	enforce
it.	 He	 cannot	 simply	 drop	 the	 charges.	 The	 police	 union	 is	 breathing	 down	 his
neck.
A	word	here	about	Max	Mancini.	Max	is	the	City’s	chief	prosecutor,	appointed
by	the	mayor	and	approved	by	the	city	council.	He’s	loud,	flamboyant,	ambitious,
a	 driven	 man	 who’s	 going	 places,	 though	 it’s	 not	 clear	 exactly	 where.	 He	 loves
cameras	as	much	as	I	do	and	will	knock	folks	out	of	the	way	to	get	in	front	of	one.
He’s	crafty	in	the	courtroom	and	boasts	of	a	99	percent	conviction	rate,	same	as
every	 other	 prosecutor	 in	 America.	 Because	 he’s	 the	 boss,	 he	 gets	 to	 manipulate
the	numbers,	so	he	has	real	proof	that	his	99	percent	is	legitimate.
Normally,	 in	 a	 case	 as	 big	 as	 Doug	 Renfro’s,	 with	 front-page	 coverage
guaranteed	and	live-action	shots	morning,	noon,	and	night,	Max	would	be	dressed
in	his	finest	and	hogging	the	spotlight.	However,	this	case	is	dangerous	and	Max
knows	 it.	 Everybody	 knows	 it.	 The	 cops	 were	 wrong.	 The	 Renfros	 are	 victims.	 A
guilty	verdict	seems	unlikely,	and	if	there’s	one	thing	Max	Mancini	cannot	risk	it’s
the	wrong	verdict.
So,	he’s	hiding.	Not	a	peep	out	of	our	chief	prosecutor.	I’m	sure	he’s	lurking
around	somewhere	in	the	shadows,	gawking	at	all	the	cameras	and	dying	inside,
but	Max	will	not	be	seen	during	this	trial.	Instead,	he	dumped	it	on	Chuck	Finney.

19.
It	takes	three	days	to	pick	a	jury,	and	it’s	clear	that	all	twelve	know	a	lot	about
the	 case.	 I	 have	 wrestled	 with	 the	 strategy	 of	 requesting	 a	 change	 of	 venue,	 but
decided	 against	 it.	 There	 are	 a	 couple	 of	 reasons	 for	 this,	 one	 legitimate	 and	 the
other	based	on	pure	ego.	The	first	is	that	many	people	in	this	city	are	fed	up	with
the	 cops	 and	 their	 brutal	 tactics.	 The	 second	 is	 that	 there	 are	 reporters	 and
cameras	 everywhere,	 and	 this	 is	 my	 turf.	 Most	 important,	 though,	 my	 client
prefers	to	be	tried	by	a	jury	of	his	fellow	citizens.
In	 a	 crowded	 courtroom,	 Judge	 Ponder	 says,	 “Ladies	 and	 gentlemen	 of	 the
jury,	 we	 will	 now	 begin	 this	 trial	 with	 the	 opening	 statements.	 First,	 the	 State’s
attorney,	 Mr.	 Finney,	 then	 the	 defense,	 Mr.	 Rudd.	 I	 caution	 you	 that	 nothing
you’re	 about	 to	 hear	 is	 actually	 evidence.	 The	 evidence	 comes	 from	 only	 one
source,	and	that’s	this	witness	chair	right	here.	Mr.	Finney.”
The	 prosecutor	 rises	 solemnly	 from	 his	 seat	 at	 the	 table,	 a	 table	 filled	 with
deputy	prosecutors	and	useless	assistants.	It’s	a	show	of	legal	muscle,	an	attempt
to	 impress	 the	 jury	 with	 the	 gravity	 of	 the	 case	 against	 Mr.	 Renfro.	 I	 have	 a
different	strategy.	Doug	and	I	sit	alone,	just	the	two	of	us.	Two	little	guys	facing
the	 depthless	 resources	 of	 the	 government.	 The	 defense	 table	 seems	 almost
deserted	when	compared	to	the	army	across	the	aisle.	I	live	for	this	David	versus
Goliath	image.
Chuck	 Finney	 is	 fiercely	 dull,	 and	 he	 begins	 with	 a	 grave	 “Ladies	 and
gentlemen,	this	is	a	tragic	case.”	No	kidding,	Chuck.	Is	that	the	best	you	can	do?
Finney	 may	 not	 have	 his	 heart	 in	 this	 case,	 but	 he’s	 not	 about	 to	 roll	 over.
There	are	too	many	people	watching,	too	much	at	stake.	Now	that	the	opening	bell
has	 sounded,	 the	 game	 is	 on.	 And	 the	 game	 is	 not	 about	 justice;	 from	 this	 point
forward	 it’s	 all	 about	 winning.	 He	 does	 a	 fair	 job	 of	 describing	 the	 dangers	 of
police	 work,	 especially	 in	 this	 day	 and	 age	 of	 assault	 weapons,	 sophisticated
criminals,	drug	gangs,	and	terrorists.	Today’s	policemen	are	often	targets,	victims
of	 extremely	 violent	 thugs	 who	 have	 no	 respect	 for	 authority.	 There’s	 a	 war	 out
there,	a	war	on	drugs,	a	war	on	terror,	a	war	on	pretty	much	everything,	and	our
brave	 law	 enforcement	 officers	 have	 every	 right	 to	 arm	 themselves	 to	 the	 hilt.
That’s	 why	 the	 smart	 people	 we	 elect	 to	 make	 our	 laws	 decided	 six	 years	 ago	 to
make	it	a	crime	for	a	person,	yes	even	a	homeowner,	to	fire	upon	our	police	when
they	are	simply	doing	their	jobs.	That’s	why	Doug	Renfro	is	guilty	as	a	matter	of
law.	 He	 fired	 upon	 our	 police,	 and	 he	 wounded	 Officer	 Scott	 Keestler,	 a	 veteran
who	was	just	doing	his	job.
Finney	is	striking	the	right	chords	and	scoring	some	points	here.	A	couple	of
the	 jurors	 glance	 disapprovingly	 at	 my	 client.	 After	 all,	 he	 did	 shoot	 a	 cop.	 But
Finney	is	careful.	The	facts	are	not	in	his	favor,	regardless	of	what	the	law	says.	He

is	 concise,	 to	 the	 point,	 and	 sits	 down	 after	 only	 ten	 minutes.	 A	 record	 for	 a
prosecutor.
Judge	Ponder	says,	“Mr.	Rudd,	for	the	defense.”
As	a	criminal	defense	lawyer,	I	rarely	have	the	facts	in	my	favor.	But	when	I
do,	 I	 find	 it	 impossible	 to	 be	 subtle.	 Hit	 ’em	 fast	 and	 hard,	 and	 watch	 them
scramble.	I	have	believed	since	day	one	that	I	can	win	this	case	with	the	opening
statement.	I	toss	my	legal	pad	on	the	podium	and	look	at	the	jurors.	Eye	contact
with	every	one	of	them.
I	begin,	“First	they	shot	his	dog	Spike,	a	twelve-year-old	yellow	Lab	who	was
fast	asleep	on	his	bed	in	the	kitchen.	What	did	Spike	do	to	deserve	getting	killed?
Nothing,	 he	 was	 just	 in	 the	 right	 place	 at	 the	 wrong	 time.	 Why	 would	 they	 kill
Spike?	They	will	attempt	to	answer	this	question	with	one	of	their	standard	lies.
They	 will	 tell	 you	 that	 Spike	 threatened	 them,	 same	 as	 every	 other	 dog	 they	 kill
when	they	invade	private	homes	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	In	the	last	five	years,
ladies	and	gentlemen,	our	gallant	SWAT	boys	have	killed	at	least	thirty	innocent
dogs	in	this	city,	from	old	mutts	to	young	puppies,	all	of	whom	were	just	minding
their	own	business.”
Behind	 me,	 Chuck	 Finney	 stands	 and	 says,	 “Objection,	 Your	 Honor.
Relevancy.	Not	sure	why	the	other	SWAT	maneuvers	are	relevant	to	this	case.”
I	 turn	 to	 the	 judge,	 and	 before	 he	 can	 rule	 I	 say,	 “Oh,	 it’s	 relevant,	 Your
Honor.	Let’s	allow	the	jury	to	hear	exactly	how	these	raids	go	down.	We	will	prove
that	these	cops	are	trigger-happy	and	ready	to	shoot	anything	that	moves.”
Judge	Ponder	raises	a	hand	and	says,	“That’s	enough,	Mr.	Rudd.	I’ll	overrule
the	objection.	It’s	just	an	opening	statement	and	not	evidence.”
True,	but	the	jurors	have	already	heard	me.	I	return	to	them	and	say,	“Spike
didn’t	 have	 a	 chance.	 The	 SWAT	 team	 kicked	 in	 the	 front	 and	 back	 doors
simultaneously,	and	eight	heavily	armed	warrior	cops	raced	into	the	Renfro	home.
By	the	time	Spike	could	get	to	his	feet	and	bark	he	was	dead,	blown	away	by	three
bullets	from	a	semiautomatic	handgun,	the	same	kind	used	by	Army	Rangers.	And
the	killing	had	just	begun.”
I	 pause	 and	 look	 at	 the	 jurors,	 some	 of	 whom	 are	 no	 doubt	 more	 distressed
over	the	dead	dog	than	anything	else	that	happened	that	night.
“Eight	 cops,	 eight	 SWAT	 team	 members,	 all	 equipped	 with	 more	 gear	 and
armor	 than	 any	 American	 soldier	 who	 fought	 in	 Vietnam	 or	 World	 War	 II.
Bulletproof	 vests,	 night-vision	 goggles,	 highly	 sophisticated	 weapons,	 even	 black
face	paint	to	add	a	little	drama.	But	why?	Why	were	they	there?”	I’m	pacing	now,
back	 and	 forth	 in	 front	 of	 the	 jury	 box.	 I	 glance	 at	 the	 spectators,	 the	 place	 is
packed,	 and	 I	 see	 the	 chief	 of	 police	 in	 the	 front	 row,	 hating	 me.	 Their	 usual
routine	in	any	case	involving	the	police	is	to	line	up	about	two	dozen	uniformed
cops	 on	 the	 front	 rows,	 where	 they	 sit	 with	 folded	 arms	 and	 glare	 at	 the	 jurors.

Judge	 Ponder,	 though,	 would	 have	 none	 of	 it.	 I	 filed	 a	 motion	 to	 keep	 cops	 in
uniforms	 out	 of	 the	 courtroom,	 and	 he	 agreed.	 The	 eight	 SWAT	 boys	 are	 being
kept	in	witness	rooms	and	missing	the	fun.
“This	 disaster	 began	 with	 the	 boy	 next	 door,	 a	 troubled	 kid	 named	 Lance,
nineteen	years	old	and	going	nowhere.	Lance	was	rightfully	unemployed	but	not
altogether	unproductive.	He	made	good	money	selling	illegal	narcotics,	primarily
the	drug	Ecstasy.	He	was	too	smart	to	work	the	streets,	so	Lance	used	the	Internet.
But	 not	 the	 Internet	 we	 know.	 Lance	 lived	 in	 the	 murky	 and	 forbidden	 world	 of
the	Dark	Web,	a	place	where	Google	and	Yahoo	and	the	other	great	search	engines
do	not	go.	Lance	had	been	buying	and	selling	drugs	on	the	Dark	Web	for	two	years
when	he	realized	the	Renfros	had	an	unsecured	wireless	router.	For	a	clever	boy
like	 Lance	 it	 was	 easy	 to	 piggyback.	 For	 a	 year	 Lance	 bought	 and	 sold	 Ecstasy,
using	 the	 Renfros’	 wireless	 system,	 and	 of	 course	 they	 didn’t	 have	 a	 clue.	 This
case,	 though,	 is	 not	 about	 drug	 trafficking,	 so	 don’t	 be	 deceived.	 It’s	 about	 a
gargantuan	 screwup	 by	 our	 police	 department.	 The	 state	 investigators	 were
rounding	up	online	drug	dealers	and	came	across	the	Renfros’	IP	address.	With	no
other	 evidence,	 and	 no	 real	 investigation,	 they	 launched	 a	 sting.	 They	 got	 two
warrants:	an	arrest	warrant	for	Doug	Renfro,	and	a	search	warrant	for	his	home.”
I	 pause	 here	 and	 get	 a	 drink	 of	 water.	 I	 have	 never	 felt	 such	 stillness	 in	 a
courtroom.	All	eyes	are	on	me.	All	ears	are	listening.	I	return	to	the	jury	box	and
lean	 on	 the	 podium,	 as	 if	 I’m	 having	 a	 friendly	 chat	 with	 my	 grandfather.	 “Now,
back	in	the	old	days	and	not	too	long	ago,	back	when	police	work	was	done	by	cops
who	 knew	 their	 beat	 and	 knew	 how	 to	 handle	 criminals,	 back	 when	 the	 police
knew	they	were	police	and	not	Navy	SEALs,	back	then,	ladies	and	gentlemen,	an
arrest	warrant	would	be	served	by	a	couple	of	officers	who	would	drive	over	to	Mr.
Renfro’s	home,	at	a	decent	hour,	ring	his	doorbell,	step	inside	his	house,	and	tell
him	he	was	under	arrest.	They	would	handcuff	him	and	take	him	away,	and	do	so
with	a	great	deal	of	professionalism.	Another	pair	of	officers	would	show	up	with
the	search	warrant	and	get	Mr.	Renfro’s	computer.	Within	a	couple	of	hours,	the
police	would	realize	their	mistake.	They	would	apologize	profusely	to	Mr.	Renfro
and	take	him	home.	Then	they	would	solve	their	crime.	Compare	then	with	now.
Now,	 at	 least	 in	 this	 city	 with	 its	 current	 leadership,	 the	 police	 launch	 surprise
attacks	on	unsuspecting	and	law-abiding	citizens	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	And
they	shoot	them,	and	their	dogs,	and	when	they	realize	they	have	the	wrong	house,
they	lie	and	cover	up.”	Another	long	pause	as	I	step	behind	the	podium,	glance	at
some	 notes	 I	 don’t	 need,	 and	 return	 my	 gaze	 to	 the	 jurors.	 If	 any	 of	 them	 are
breathing,	 I	 can’t	 tell	 it.	 “Ladies	 and	 gentlemen,	 we	 have	 a	 bad	 law	 in	 this	 state
that	says	that	a	homeowner,	one	like	Doug	Renfro,	who	fires	upon	an	officer	of	the
law,	even	if	the	cop	is	at	the	wrong	house,	is	automatically	guilty.	So	why	bother
with	this	trial?	Why	doesn’t	someone	simply	read	the	statute	and	tell	Mr.	Renfro
to	 go	 to	 prison	 for	 the	 next	 forty	 years?	 Well,	 because	 there	 is	 no	 such	 thing	 as
automatic	guilt.	That’s	why	we	have	juries,	and	your	job	will	be	to	decide	if	Doug
Renfro	knew	what	he	was	doing.	Did	he	know	the	police	were	in	his	house?	When

he	scrambled	into	the	hallway	and	saw	figures	moving	in	the	darkness,	what	was
he	 thinking?	 I’ll	 tell	 you.	 He	 was	 terrified.	 He	 was	 convinced	 some	 dangerous
criminals	 had	 broken	 in	 and	 began	 shooting.	 And,	 most	 important,	 he	 did	 not
know	they	were	police	officers.	If	he	didn’t	know,	then	he	cannot	be	found	guilty.
They	 couldn’t	 be	 police	 officers,	 could	 they?	 Why	 would	 the	 cops	 come	 to	 his
house	 when	 he’d	 done	 nothing	 wrong?	 Why	 would	 they	 show	 up	 at	 three	 in	 the
morning,	when	everyone	was	sound	asleep?	Why	didn’t	they	knock	on	the	door	or
ring	the	bell?	Why	did	they	kick	in	the	front	door,	and	the	back?	Why,	why,	why?
Policemen	don’t	behave	in	such	an	outrageous	manner.	Or	do	they?”

20.
The	first	witness	is	a	big	shot	from	the	state	police.	Ruskin	is	his	name,	and	he
is	put	on	the	stand	to	begin	the	impossible	task	of	justifying	what	the	police	were
doing	 the	 night	 they	 raided	 the	 Renfros’	 home.	 With	 Finney	 serving	 up	 direct
questions	that	have	been	so	overly	rehearsed	they	have	no	spontaneity,	they	plow
through	 the	 “insidious”	 rise	 of	 drug	 trafficking	 on	 the	 Internet,	 the	 “distressing”
rise	in	the	number	of	teenagers	who	buy	and	sell	there,	and	so	on.	I’m	on	my	feet
constantly	with	“Your	Honor,	I	object	on	the	grounds	of	relevancy.	What	does	this
testimony	have	to	do	with	Doug	Renfro?”
After	 Judge	 Ponder	 overrules	 me	 three	 times,	 he	 begins	 to	 get	 frustrated.
Finney	 senses	 this	 and	 moves	 on.	 They	 walk	 through	 a	 tedious	 narrative	 in	 an
attempt	 to	 explain	 how	 the	 state	 police	 set	 up	 an	 Internet	 scam	 to	 catch	 drug
dealers.	 All	 in	 all,	 it	 was	 fairly	 successful.	 They	 caught	 about	 forty	 people	 in	 our
state.	Aren’t	they	smart	cops?
“Did	you	kill	anybody	else?”	is	my	first	question,	fired	from	my	seat	as	I	jump
into	what	will	be	a	contentious	cross-examination.
I	 ask	 Ruskin	 about	 the	 other	 arrests.	 Were	 SWAT	 teams	 used	 to	 serve
warrants?	 Were	 there	 home	 invasions	 at	 three	 in	 the	 morning?	 Did	 anyone	 else
lose	a	dog?	Did	you	send	in	the	tanks?	Halfway	through	my	cross-examination,	I
force	 him	 to	 admit	 what	 the	 world	 has	 known	 for	 months:	 They	 got	 the	 wrong
house.	His	reluctance	to	admit	it,	though,	damages	his	credibility.
In	two	hours	I	reduce	Ruskin	to	a	babbling	fool,	one	who	can’t	wait	to	get	off
the	witness	stand.
I	am	often	a	sanctimonious	asshole	when	my	clients	are	dead	guilty.	Give	me
an	 innocent	 man,	 though,	 and	 I	 reek	 of	 arrogance	 and	 superiority.	 I	 realize	 this
and	struggle	mightily	to	give	the	impression,	to	the	jury	anyway,	that	I	am	actually
likeable.	 I	 don’t	 really	 care	 if	 they	 hate	 me,	 as	 long	 as	 they	 don’t	 hate	 my	 client.
But	when	representing	a	saint	like	Doug	Renfro,	it’s	imperative	that	I	come	across
as	zealous,	but	not	offensive.	Incredulous	at	the	injustice,	but	also	trustworthy.
Their	 next	 witness	 is	 Chip	 Sumerall,	 the	 leader	 of	 the	 invasion,	 a	 lieutenant
on	the	force.	He’s	brought	in	from	a	witness	room	and	sworn	to	tell	the	truth.	As
always,	 he’s	 wearing	 his	 uniform	 with	 as	 many	 patches	 and	 medals	 as	 possible.
Full	uniform	and	regalia	and	finery,	but	minus	his	service	revolver	and	handcuffs.
He’s	a	cocky	ass	with	a	strut,	thick	arms,	and	a	crew	cut.	We	had	words	during	his
deposition	 and	 I	 glare	 at	 him	 as	 if	 he’s	 already	 lying.	 Finney	 walks	 him	 through
their	narrative.	They	dwell	on	his	extensive	training	and	experience,	his	glorious
record.	 They	 walk	 methodically	 through	 the	 time	 line	 of	 the	 Renfro	 episode.	 He
passes	the	buck	as	best	he	can,	saying	more	than	once	that	he	was	just	following
orders.

I	 get	 a	 sense	 the	 entire	 courtroom	 is	 waiting	 for	 me	 to	 annihilate	 him	 on
cross,	and	I	struggle	to	control	myself.	I	begin	by	commenting	on	his	uniform,	how
nice	 and	 professional	 it	 is.	 How	 often	 does	 he	 wear	 it?	 What	 do	 some	 of	 the
medals	signify?	Then	I	ask	him	to	describe	the	uniform	he	was	wearing	the	night
he	kicked	in	the	door	of	the	Renfro	home.	Layer	by	layer,	article	by	article,	weapon
by	weapon,	from	his	steel-toed	jackboots	to	his	panzer-style	combat	helmet,	we	go
through	 every	 bit	 of	 it.	 I	 ask	 him	 about	 his	 submachine	 gun,	 a	 Heckler	 &	 Koch
MP5,	designed	for	close	combat	and	the	finest	in	the	world,	he	says	proudly.	I	ask
him	if	he	used	it	that	night	and	he	says	he	did.	I	grill	him	on	whether	he	fired	the
shots	 that	 killed	 Kitty	 Renfro,	 and	 he	 claims	 he	 doesn’t	 know.	 It	 was	 dark	 and
things	happened	fast.	Bullets	were	flying;	the	police	were	“taking	fire.”
As	I	walk	around	the	courtroom,	I	glance	at	Doug.	His	face	is	in	his	hands	as
he	relives	the	nightmare.	I	glance	at	the	jurors;	some	are	in	disbelief.
“You	say	it	was	dark,	Officer.	But	you	were	outfitted	with	night-vision	glasses,
weren’t	you?”
“Yes.”	He’s	been	well	coached	and	keeps	his	answers	as	short	as	possible.
“And	these	are	designed	to	allow	officers	to	see	in	the	dark,	right?”
“Yes.”
“Okay,	then	why	couldn’t	you	see	in	the	dark?”
The	 answer	 is	 obvious;	 he	 squirms	 a	 bit,	 but	 he’s	 a	 tough	 one.	 He	 tries	 to
evade	with	“Well,	again,	it	all	happened	so	fast.	Before	I	could	focus,	shots	were
fired	and	we	just	responded.”
“And	you	couldn’t	see	Kitty	Renfro	at	the	end	of	the	hallway,	thirty	feet	away,
in	her	white	pajamas?”
“I	didn’t	see	her,	no.”
I	 badger	 him	 relentlessly	 on	 what	 he	 saw	 or	 should	 have	 seen.	 When	 I’ve
scored	every	point	possible	on	this,	I	jump	back	to	the	issue	of	police	procedure.
Who	authorized	the	SWAT	mission?	Who	was	in	the	room	when	the	decision	was
made?	 Did	 he	 or	 anyone	 else	 have	 the	 common	 sense	 to	 say	 perhaps	 such	 a
mission	was	not	necessary?	Why	did	you	wait	until	three	in	the	morning	to	go	in,
when	 it	 was	 dark?	 What	 led	 you	 to	 believe	 Doug	 Renfro	 was	 such	 a	 dangerous
man?	He	starts	to	crack,	to	lose	his	cool.	He	looks	to	Finney	for	help	but	there’s
nothing	he	can	do.	He	glances	at	the	jury	and	sees	nothing	but	suspicion.
I	 grind	 away	 and	 expose	 the	 idiocy	 of	 their	 procedures.	 We	 talk	 about	 their
training	 and	 their	 equipment.	 I	 even	 manage	 to	 bring	 the	 tank	 into	 the
proceedings,	and	Judge	Ponder	allows	me	to	show	the	jury	an	enlarged	photo	of	it.
The	 real	 fun	 begins	 when	 I’m	 allowed	 to	 explore	 other	 botched	 raids.
Sumerall	 has	 been	 suspended	 on	 two	 prior	 occasions	 for	 excessive	 force,	 and	 I
walk	 him	 through	 those	 episodes.	 At	 times	 his	 face	 gets	 red.	 At	 other	 times	 he’s

sweating.	 Finally,	 at	 6:00	 p.m.,	 after	 Sumerall	 has	 spent	 four	 grueling	 hours	 on
the	stand,	Judge	Ponder	asks	me	if	I’m	almost	finished.
“No,	sir,	just	getting	started,”	I	say,	real	chipper,	glaring	at	Sumerall.	I’m	so
pumped	I	could	go	until	midnight.
“Very	well,	then,	we’ll	stand	in	recess	until	nine	in	the	morning.”

21.
At	 nine	 sharp	 on	 Friday	 morning,	 the	 jurors	 are	 led	 in	 and	 welcomed	 by
Judge	 Ponder.	 Officer	 Sumerall	 is	 called	 and	 takes	 the	 stand	 again.	 Some	 of	 his
cockiness	is	gone,	but	not	all	of	it.
“Please	 continue	 your	 cross-examination,	 Mr.	 Rudd,”	 Ponder	 says.	 With	 the
assistance	of	a	clerk,	I	unfold	and	mount	a	large	diagram	of	the	Renfro	home,	both
first	and	second	floors.	I	ask	Sumerall,	as	the	leader	of	this	team,	to	enlighten	us
about	 how	 the	 eight	 men	 were	 selected.	 Why	 were	 they	 divided	 into	 two	 teams,
one	 for	 the	 front	 door,	 one	 for	 the	 back?	 What	 was	 each	 man’s	 role?	 What
weapons	did	each	cop	have?	Who	made	the	decision	not	to	ring	the	doorbell,	but
instead	just	go	crashing	in?	How	were	the	doors	opened?	Who	opened	them?	Who
were	the	first	cops	in?	Who	shot	Spike,	and	why?
Sumerall	 cannot,	 or	 will	 not,	 answer	 most	 of	 my	 questions,	 and	 before	 long
he’s	 looking	 like	 an	 idiot.	 He	 was	 the	 commander,	 and	 proud	 of	 it,	 but	 on	 the
stand	he’s	not	sure	of	a	lot	of	details.	I	hammer	him	for	two	hours	and	we	take	a
break.	Over	a	quick	coffee,	Doug	tells	me	the	jurors	are	skeptical	and	suspicious;	a
few	seemed	to	be	seething.	“We	got	’em,”	he	says,	but	I	caution	him.	Two	of	the
jurors	 in	 particular	 worry	 me	 because	 they	 have	 ties	 to	 the	 police	 department,
according	to	my	old	pal	Nate	Spurio.	We	met	last	night	for	a	drink	and	he	says	the
cops	are	leaning	on	numbers	four	and	seven.	I’ll	deal	with	it	later.
I	 resist	 the	 urge	 to	 hound	 Sumerall	 for	 the	 entire	 day,	 something	 I	 do	 more
often	than	I	should.	There	is	an	art	to	cross-examination,	and	quitting	while	you’re
ahead	is	part	of	the	skill.	I	haven’t	learned	it	yet	because	my	instinct	is	to	kick	a
brute	like	Sumerall	repeatedly	when	he’s	already	down.
Doug	says,	wisely,	“I	think	you’ve	done	enough	with	this	witness.”
He’s	right,	so	I	tell	the	judge	I’m	finished	with	Sumerall.	The	next	witness	is
Scott	Keestler,	the	cop	who	got	shot,	apparently	by	Doug	Renfro.	Finney	takes	him
first	on	direct	and	tries	his	best	to	evoke	some	sympathy.	The	truth	is—and	I	have
all	 the	 medical	 reports—the	 bullet	 wound	 to	 his	 neck	 was	 only	 slightly	 more
serious	than	superficial.	In	combat,	he	would	have	been	given	a	couple	of	BandAids	 and	 sent	 back	 to	 the	 front.	 But	 the	 prosecution	 needs	 to	 score	 here,	 and
Keestler	sounds	like	he	took	a	bullet	between	the	eyes.	They	drag	this	out	far	too
long,	and	we	finally	break	for	lunch.
When	 we’re	 back	 in	 the	 courtroom,	 Finney	 says,	 “No	 more	 questions,	 Your
Honor.”
“Mr.	Rudd.”
At	 full	 volume,	 I	 pounce	 on	 Keestler	 with	 “Officer,	 did	 you	 murder	 Kitty
Renfro?”

Talk	 about	 sucking	 the	 air	 out	 of	 a	 room.	 Finney	 stumbles	 to	 his	 feet,
objecting.	Judge	Ponder	says,	“Mr.	Rudd,	if	you—”
“We’re	 talking	 about	 murder	 here,	 Judge,	 aren’t	 we?	 Kitty	 Renfro	 was
unarmed	when	someone	shot	and	killed	her	in	her	own	home.	That’s	murder.”
Finney	says	loudly,	“It	is	not.	We	have	a	statute	on	this	point.	Peace	officers
are	not	liable—”
“Maybe	not	liable,”	I	interrupt.	“But	it’s	still	murder.”	I	wave	my	arms	at	the
jury	 and	 demand,	 “What	 else	 do	 you	 call	 it?”	 Three	 or	 four	 actually	 nod
affirmatively.
Judge	Ponder	says,	“Please	refrain	from	using	the	word	‘murder,’	Mr.	Rudd.”
I	take	a	deep	breath;	so	does	everyone	else.	Keestler	looks	like	a	man	facing	a
firing	squad.	I	return	to	the	podium,	stare	at	him,	and	say	politely,	“Peace	Officer
Keestler,	on	the	night	of	this	SWAT	raid,	what	were	you	wearing?”
“I’m	sorry.”
“What	 were	 you	 wearing,	 please?	 Tell	 the	 jury	 everything	 that	 was	 on	 your
body.”
He	 swallows	 hard,	 then	 begins	 clicking	 off	 the	 armor,	 weaponry,	 and	 so	 on.
It’s	a	long	list.	“Keep	going,”	I	say.	He	finishes	with	“Boxer	shorts,	T-shirt,	white
athletic	socks.”
“Thank	you.	Is	that	all?”
“Yes.”
“Are	you	sure?”
“Yes.”
“Absolutely	certain?”
“Yes,	I’m	certain.”
I	stare	at	him	as	though	he’s	a	filthy	liar,	then	I	walk	to	the	exhibit	table	and
pick	 up	 a	 large	 color	 photograph	 of	 Keestler	 on	 a	 stretcher	 as	 he’s	 being	 rushed
into	the	ER.	His	face	is	clearly	visible.	Since	the	photo	has	already	been	introduced
into	evidence,	I	hand	it	to	Keestler	and	ask,	“That	you?”
He	looks	at	it,	confused,	says,	“That’s	me.”
The	 judge	 allows	 me	 to	 pass	 the	 photo	 to	 the	 jurors.	 They	 take	 their	 time,
absorb	the	image,	then	I	take	it	back.	“Now,	Peace	Officer	Keestler,	looking	at	you
in	this	photograph,	what	is	this	black	stuff	you’re	wearing	on	your	face?”
He	smiles,	relieved.	Aw	shucks.	“Oh	that,	that’s	just	black	camouflage	paint.”
“Also	known	as	war	paint?”
“I	guess.	It	has	several	names.”

“What’s	the	purpose	of	war	paint?”
“It’s	for	camouflage	purposes.”
“So	it’s	pretty	important,	huh?”
“Sure	is,	yes.”
“It’s	necessary	to	insure	the	safety	of	the	men	on	the	ground,	right?”
“Absolutely.”
“How	many	of	the	eight	peace	officers	in	your	SWAT	team	that	night	covered
their	faces	with	black	war	paint?”
“I	didn’t	count.”
“Did	all	of	our	peace	officers	wear	black	war	paint	that	night?”
He	knows	the	answer	and	he	figures	I	do	too.	He	says,	“I’m	really	not	sure.”
I	 walk	 to	 my	 table	 and	 pick	 up	 a	 thick	 deposition.	 I	 make	 sure	 he	 sees	 it.
“Now,	Peace	Officer	Keestler—”
Finney	 stands	 and	 says,	 “Now,	 Your	 Honor,	 I’ll	 object	 here.	 He	 keeps	 using
the	term	‘peace	officer.’	I	think	that—”
“You	used	it	first,”	Judge	Ponder	fires	back.	“You	used	it	first.	Overruled.”
We	eventually	establish	that	four	of	the	cops	decorated	themselves	with	black
war	paint,	and	by	the	time	I	move	on	Keestler	looks	as	dumb	as	a	teenager	playing
with	crayons.	It’s	time	for	some	real	fun.	I	say,	“Now,	Peace	Officer	Keestler,	you
play	a	lot	of	video	games,	right?”
Finney	is	back	on	his	feet.	“Objection,	Your	Honor.	Relevancy.”
“Overruled,”	His	Honor	says	harshly	without	even	looking	at	the	prosecutor.
Judge	Ponder	has	become	increasingly,	and	obviously,	fed	up	with	the	police	and
their	 lies	 and	 tactics.	 We	 have	 all	 the	 momentum—a	 rarity	 for	 me—and	 I’m	 not
sure	how	to	handle	it.	Do	I	speed	things	along	and	get	the	case	to	the	jury	while
they’re	on	our	side?	Or	do	I	plod	along,	scoring	every	possible	point?
Scoring	 is	 so	 much	 fun,	 plus	 I	 have	 a	 hunch	 the	 jury	 is	 squarely	 on	 my	 side
and	 enjoying	 this	 train	 wreck.	 “What	 are	 some	 of	 the	 video	 games	 you	 enjoy
playing?”
He	names	a	few—benign,	almost	kiddie-like	games	that	make	him	sound	like
an	overgrown	fifth	grader.	He	and	Finney	know	what’s	coming	and	they’re	trying
to	soften	the	blow.	In	doing	so,	Keestler	looks	even	worse.
“How	old	are	you,	Mr.	Keestler?”
“Twenty-six,”	he	says	with	a	smile,	finally	an	honest	answer.
“And	you’re	still	playing	video	games?”

“Well,	yes,	sir.”
“In	fact,	you’ve	spent	thousands	of	hours	playing	video	games,	right?”
“I	guess.”
“And	 one	 of	 your	 favorites	 is	 Mortal	 Attack	 Three,	 right?”	 I’m	 holding	 his
deposition,	 a	 thick	 sworn	 statement	 in	 which	 I	 managed	 to	 hammer	 out	 the	 fact
that	he	got	hooked	on	video	games	when	he	was	a	kid	and	still	loves	them.
“I	guess,	yes,”	he	says.
I	 wave	 his	 deposition	 like	 it’s	 poison	 and	 say,	 “Well,	 haven’t	 you	 already
testified,	in	a	sworn	deposition,	that	you’ve	been	playing	Mortal	Attack	Three	for
the	past	ten	years?”
“Yes,	sir.”
I	look	at	Judge	Ponder	and	say,	“Your	Honor,	I	would	like	to	show	the	jury	a
clip	from	Mortal	Attack	Three.”
Finney	 is	 turning	 flips.	 We’ve	 been	 arguing	 about	 this	 for	 a	 month,	 with
Ponder	 withholding	 a	 ruling	 until	 this	 very	 moment.	 Finally,	 he	 says,	 “I’m
intrigued.	Let’s	take	a	look.”
Finney	 tosses	 a	 legal	 pad	 on	 his	 table	 in	 total	 frustration.	 Ponder	 growls,
“Enough	of	the	theatrics,	Mr.	Finney.	Take	a	seat!”
I	rarely	have	the	judge	on	my	side	and	I’m	not	sure	how	to	act.
The	 courtroom	 lights	 are	 dimmed	 while	 a	 screen	 drops	 from	 the	 ceiling.	 A
tech	 guy	 has	 edited	 a	 five-minute	 clip	 of	 the	 video	 game.	 At	 my	 instruction,	 he
cranks	up	the	volume,	and	the	jury	is	jolted	by	the	sudden	image	of	a	bulky	soldier
kicking	in	a	door	as	explosions	rip	through	the	background.	An	animal	resembling
a	 dog	 but	 with	 shining	 teeth	 and	 huge	 talons	 lunges	 forward	 and	 our	 hero	 guns
him	down.	Villains	appear	in	doors	and	windows,	and	they’re	all	blown	to	hell	and
back.	Bullets,	the	kind	you	can	see,	blast	and	ricochet.	Body	parts	are	ripped	off.
Blood	is	knee-deep.	People	scream	and	shoot	and	die	with	great	drama,	and	after
two	minutes	we’ve	seen	enough.
After	five	minutes,	the	entire	courtroom	needs	a	break.	The	screen	goes	blank
and	 the	 lights	 come	 on.	 I	 glare	 at	 Keestler,	 who’s	 still	 on	 the	 witness	 stand,	 and
say,	“All	fun	and	games,	right,	Peace	Officer	Keestler?”
He	 does	 not	 respond.	 I	 watch	 him	 drown	 for	 a	 few	 seconds,	 then	 say,	 “And
you	also	enjoy	playing	a	game	called	Home	Invasion,	right?”
He	shrugs,	looks	toward	Finney	for	help,	and	finally	grunts,	“I	guess.”
Finney	stands	and	says,	“Judge,	is	this	really	relevant?”	The	judge	is	leaning
on	his	elbows	and	ready	for	more.	He	says,	“Oh,	I	think	this	is	very	relevant,	Mr.
Finney.	Let’s	roll	the	tape.”

The	 lights	 go	 down,	 and	 for	 three	 minutes	 we	 watch	 the	 same	 mindless
mayhem	and	gore.	If	I	caught	Starcher	playing	this	garbage,	I’d	lock	him	away	in
rehab.	At	one	point,	juror	number	six	whispers	loudly,	“Good	God!”	I	watch	them
as	they	stare	at	the	screen,	thoroughly	disgusted.
When	the	videos	are	over,	I	force	Keestler	to	admit	that	he	also	likes	a	game
called	Crack	House—Special	Ops.	 He	 admits	 the	 cops	 have	 a	 locker	 room	 in	 the
basement	of	the	police	department.	Courtesy	of	the	taxpayers,	it	is	equipped	with
a	fifty-four-inch	flat-screen	television,	and	for	fun	the	boys	gather	there	between
SWAT	 maneuvers	 and	 play	 video	 game	 tournaments.	 Over	 Finney’s	 lame
objections,	I	drag	this	out	of	Keestler,	bit	by	bit.	By	now,	he	doesn’t	want	to	talk
about	it,	and	this	makes	matters	worse	for	him	and	the	prosecution.	When	I	finish
with	him,	he	is	destroyed	and	discredited.
As	I	sit	down,	I	look	at	the	gallery.	The	chief	of	police	is	gone,	and	for	good.
Judge	Ponder	asks,	“Who’s	your	next	witness,	Mr.	Finney?”
Finney	 has	 the	 hangdog	 look	 of	 a	 prosecutor	 who	 doesn’t	 want	 to	 call	 any
more	witnesses.	What	he	does	want	to	do	is	catch	the	next	train	out	of	town.	He
looks	at	a	notepad	and	says,	“Officer	Boyd.”	Boyd	fired	seven	rounds	that	night.	At
the	 age	 of	 seventeen,	 he	 was	 convicted	 of	 a	 DUI	 but	 managed	 to	 get	 his	 record
expunged	later.	Finney	doesn’t	know	about	the	DUI,	but	I	do.	At	the	age	of	twenty,
Boyd	received	a	dishonorable	discharge	from	the	Army.	When	he	was	twenty-four,
his	 girlfriend	 called	 911	 and	 complained	 of	 domestic	 abuse.	 Things	 were	 swept
under	 the	 rug;	 no	 charges	 stuck.	 Boyd	 is	 also	 the	 veteran	 of	 two	 other	 botched
SWAT	raids,	and	he’s	enthralled	with	the	same	video	games	that	keep	Keestler	so
occupied.
Getting	 Boyd	 on	 cross-examination	 could	 well	 be	 the	 highlight	 of	 my	 legal
career.
Judge	Ponder	suddenly	says,	“We’re	going	to	recess	until	Monday	morning	at
nine.	I	want	to	see	the	lawyers	in	my	chambers.”

22.
As	soon	as	the	door	closes,	Judge	Ponder	glares	at	Finney	and	growls,	“Your
case	sucks.	The	wrong	person	is	on	trial.”
Poor	Finney	knows	it	but	cannot	say	so.	In	fact,	at	this	moment	he’s	unable	to
say	anything	at	all.	The	judge	hammers	away.	“Do	you	plan	to	put	all	eight	of	the
SWAT	team	on	the	witness	stand?”
“As	of	now,	the	answer	is	no,”	Finney	manages	to	say.
I	pounce	with	“Great,	then	I’ll	call	them	as	adverse	witnesses.	I	want	all	eight
to	 face	 the	 jury.”	 The	 judge	 looks	 at	 me	 fearfully.	 I	 have	 the	 absolute	 right	 to	 do
this	and	they	know	it.	Seconds	pass	as	they	try	and	imagine	the	nightmare	of	the
other	six	toy	soldiers	facing	the	jury	as	I	pound	them	like	a	madman.
His	Honor	looks	at	Finney	and	asks,	“Have	you	thought	about	dismissing	the
charges?”
Of	course	not.	Finney	may	be	demoralized	but	he’s	still	a	prosecutor.
Normally,	 in	 a	 criminal	 trial	 the	 judge	 has	 the	 right	 to	 exclude	 the	 State’s
evidence	and	direct	a	verdict	in	favor	of	the	defendant.	This	rarely	happens.	In	this
case,	though,	the	statute	declares	that	any	person	who	fires	upon	a	policeman	who
is	 entering	 his	 or	 her	 home,	 whether	 the	 cops	 have	 the	 correct	 address	 or	 the
wrong	 one,	 is	 guilty	 of	 the	 attempted	 murder	 of	 an	 officer.	 It’s	 a	 bad	 statute,
poorly	conceived	and	dreadfully	written,	but	in	Judge	Ponder’s	opinion	it	does	not
afford	him	the	option	of	dismissing	the	case.
We’re	headed	for	a	final	verdict.

23.
Over	 the	 weekend,	 one	 of	 the	 remaining	 six	 SWAT	 cops	 is	 suddenly
hospitalized	and	cannot	testify.	One	simply	vanishes.	It	takes	me	a	day	and	a	half
to	annihilate	the	remaining	four.	We’re	getting	front-page	coverage	and	the	police
department	has	never,	ever	looked	so	bad.	I’m	trying	my	best	to	savor	this	glorious
moment	because	it’s	unlikely	to	happen	again.
On	the	last	day	of	testimony,	I	meet	the	Renfro	family	for	an	early	breakfast.
The	 topic	 is	 whether	 or	 not	 Doug	 should	 testify.	 His	 three	 adult	 children—
Thomas,	Fiona,	and	Susanna—are	present.	They	have	watched	the	entire	trial	and
have	no	doubt	our	jury	will	not	convict	their	father,	regardless	of	what	some	lousy
statute	says.
I	 explain	 the	 worst-case	 scenario:	 Finney	 will	 get	 under	 his	 skin	 on	 crossexamination	and	try	to	irritate	him.	He’ll	make	Doug	admit	that	he	fired	five	shots
from	his	handgun	and	deliberately	tried	to	kill	the	officers.	The	only	way	the	State
can	win	the	case	is	for	Doug	to	melt	down	on	the	stand,	something	we	simply	do
not	expect.	The	guy	is	solid,	and	he	insists	on	testifying.	At	this	point	in	any	trial,
the	 defendant	 has	 the	 right	 to	 testify,	 regardless	 of	 what	 his	 lawyer	 thinks.	 They
press	 me	 on	 this.	 My	 instincts	 are	 the	 same	 as	 any	 criminal	 defense	 attorney:	 If
the	State	has	failed	to	prove	its	case,	keep	the	client	off	the	stand.
But	Doug	Renfro	will	not	be	denied.

24.
I	begin	by	asking	Doug	about	his	military	career.	Fourteen	years	in	uniform,
proudly	serving	his	country,	without	a	blemish.	Two	tours	in	Vietnam,	one	Purple
Heart,	 two	 weeks	 as	 a	 prisoner	 before	 being	 rescued.	 Half	 a	 dozen	 medals,	 an
honorable	discharge.	A	real	soldier,	not	the	dime-store	variety.
A	law-abiding	citizen	with	only	one	speeding	ticket	on	his	record.
The	contrasts	are	stark	and	speak	for	themselves.
On	 the	 night	 in	 question	 he	 and	 Kitty	 watched	 television	 until	 10:00,	 then
read	for	a	few	minutes	until	they	turned	off	the	lights.	He	kissed	her	good	night,
told	her	he	loved	her	as	always,	and	they	fell	asleep.	They	were	jolted	from	their
dreams	 when	 the	 assault	 began.	 The	 house	 shook,	 shots	 were	 fired.	 Doug
scrambled	for	his	pistol	and	told	Kitty	to	call	911.	In	the	frenzy	that	followed,	he
ran	into	the	dark	hallway	and	saw	two	shadows	rising	quickly	from	the	stairwell.
Voices	 were	 coming	 from	 downstairs.	 He	 hit	 the	 floor	 and	 began	 firing.	 He	 was
immediately	hit	in	the	shoulder.	No,	he	said	emphatically,	no	one	ever	yelled	out
anything	 about	 the	 police.	 Kitty	 screamed	 and	 ran	 into	 the	 hallway	 and	 into	 a
volley	of	bullets.
Doug	breaks	down	when	he	describes	the	sounds	of	his	wife	being	hit.
Half	of	the	jurors	are	crying	too.

25.
Finney	 wants	 no	 part	 of	 Doug	 Renfro.	 He	 attempts	 to	 prove	 that	 Doug
deliberately	fired	upon	the	police,	but	Doug	crushes	him	by	saying	over	and	over,
“I	 didn’t	 know	 they	 were	 cops.	 I	 thought	 they	 were	 criminals	 breaking	 into	 my
house.”
I	call	no	other	witnesses.	I	don’t	need	them.
Finney	 walks	 through	 a	 halfhearted	 closing	 argument,	 during	 which	 he
refuses	to	make	eye	contact	with	any	of	the	jurors.	When	it’s	my	turn,	I	recap	the
important	facts	and	manage	to	control	myself.	It	would	be	easy	to	flay	the	cops,	to
engage	in	unbridled	overkill,	but	the	jury	has	had	enough.
Judge	Ponder	instructs	the	jurors	as	to	the	applicable	law,	then	says	it’s	time
for	them	to	retire	and	deliberate.	But	no	one	moves.	What	happens	next	borders
on	historic.
Juror	 number	 six	 is	 a	 man	 named	 Willie	 Grant.	 Slowly,	 he	 stands	 and	 says,
“Judge,	I’ve	been	elected	as	the	foreman	of	this	jury,	and	I	have	a	question.”
The	judge,	a	jurist	of	great	composure,	is	startled	and	looks	wildly	at	Finney
and	me.	The	courtroom	is	again	perfectly	silent.	Me,	I’m	not	breathing.	His	Honor
says,	“Well,	I’m	not	sure	at	this	point.	I	have	instructed	the	jury	to	retire	and	begin
deliberations.”	The	jurors	have	not	moved.
Mr.	 Grant	 says,	 “We	 don’t	 need	 to	 deliberate,	 Your	 Honor.	 We	 know	 what
we’re	going	to	do.”
“But	I	have	repeatedly	warned	you	against	discussing	the	case,”	Ponder	says
sternly.
Unfazed,	 Mr.	 Grant	 replies,	 “We	 haven’t	 discussed	 the	 case,	 but	 we	 have	 a
verdict.	There’s	nothing	to	discuss	or	deliberate.	My	question	is,	why	is	Mr.	Renfro
on	trial	and	not	the	cops	who	killed	his	wife?”
There	is	an	instant	wave	of	gasping	and	chattering	throughout	the	courtroom.
Judge	Ponder	attempts	to	regain	control	by	clearing	his	throat	loudly	and	asking,
“Is	your	verdict	unanimous?”
“Damned	right	it	is.	We	find	Mr.	Renfro	not	guilty,	and	we	think	these	cops
should	be	charged	with	murder.”
“I’m	 going	 to	 ask	 the	 jurors	 to	 raise	 your	 hands	 if	 you	 agree	 with	 the	 notguilty	verdict.”
Twelve	hands	shoot	into	the	air.
I	put	my	arm	around	Doug	Renfro	as	he	breaks	down	again.

PART	FOUR

THE	EXCHANGE

1.
I	often	disappear	after	a	big	trial,	especially	one	that	gets	front-page	coverage
and	plenty	of	airtime.	It’s	not	that	I	don’t	love	the	attention.	I’m	a	lawyer;	it’s	in
my	genes.	But	in	the	Renfro	trial	I	humiliated	the	police	department,	embarrassed
some	cops,	some	really	tough	guys	who	are	not	accustomed	to	answering	for	their
misdeeds.	As	they	say,	“The	streets	are	hot	right	now,”	and	it’s	time	for	a	break.	I
load	 some	 clothes	 into	 the	 van,	 along	 with	 my	 golf	 clubs,	 some	 paperbacks,	 and
half	a	case	of	small-batch	bourbon,	and	ease	out	of	town	the	day	after	the	verdict.
The	 weather	 is	 raw	 and	 windy,	 too	 cold	 for	 golf,	 so	 I	 head	 south	 like	 countless
other	 snowbirds	 in	 search	 of	 the	 sun.	 I	 have	 learned	 through	 my	 meandering
travels	that	almost	every	small	town	with	a	population	above	ten	thousand	has	a
public	 golf	 course.	 These	 are	 usually	 packed	 on	 weekends	 but	 not	 too	 crowded
during	 the	 week.	 I	 play	 my	 way	 south,	 hitting	 at	 least	 one	 course	 per	 day,
sometimes	 two,	 playing	 alone	 with	 no	 caddie	 and	 no	 scorecard,	 paying	 cash	 for
inexpensive	 motel	 rooms,	 eating	 little,	 and	 sipping	 bourbon	 late	 at	 night	 while	 I
read	the	latest	James	Lee	Burke	or	Michael	Connelly.	If	I	had	a	pile	of	money,	I
could	spend	the	rest	of	my	life	doing	this.
But	 I	 don’t,	 so	 I	 eventually	 return	 to	 the	 City,	 where	 my	 notoriety	 instantly
catches	up	to	me.

2.
About	a	year	ago,	a	young	woman	named	Jiliana	Kemp	was	abducted	as	she
was	leaving	a	hospital	after	visiting	a	friend.	Her	car	was	found	untouched	on	the
third	 floor	 of	 a	 parking	 garage	 next	 to	 the	 hospital.	 Surveillance	 cameras	 caught
her	walking	toward	her	car	but	lost	her	as	she	stepped	out	of	range.	The	footage
from	 all	 fourteen	 cameras	 was	 analyzed.	 It	 captured	 the	 license	 plates	 of	 every
vehicle	 coming	 and	 going	 for	 a	 twenty-four-hour	 period,	 and	 revealed	 only	 one
significant	clue.	An	hour	after	Jiliana	was	seen	walking	to	her	car,	a	blue	Ford	SUV
left	 the	 parking	 deck.	 The	 driver	 was	 a	 white	 male	 wearing	 a	 baseball	 cap	 and
glasses.	 The	 SUV	 had	 stolen	 license	 plates	 from	 Iowa.	 During	 the	 night,	 the
attendants	saw	nothing	suspicious,	and	the	one	who	took	the	ticket	from	the	white
male	did	not	remember	him.	Forty	vehicles	had	passed	through	the	exit	gate	in	the
hour	preceding	the	SUV’s	departure.
Detectives	scoured	every	inch	of	the	garage	and	found	nothing.	Her	abductor
made	 no	 demand	 for	 ransom.	 The	 search	 went	 from	 frantic	 to	 futile.	 An	 initial
reward	 of	 $100,000	 provoked	 no	 response.	 Two	 weeks	 later,	 the	 blue	 SUV	 was
found	 abandoned	 in	 a	 state	 park	 a	 hundred	 miles	 away.	 It	 had	 been	 stolen	 a
month	earlier	in	Texas.	Its	license	plates	were	from	Pennsylvania,	stolen	of	course.
The	abductor	was	playing	games.	He	had	wiped	the	SUV	clean;	no	prints,	no
hairs,	 no	 blood,	 nothing.	 His	 range,	 along	 with	 his	 planning,	 terrified	 the
investigators.	They	were	not	chasing	an	ordinary	criminal.
Adding	 to	 the	 urgency	 was	 the	 fact	 that	 Jiliana	 Kemp’s	 father	 is	 one	 of	 the
City’s	two	assistant	chiefs	of	police.	Needless	to	say,	the	case	was	given	the	highest
priority	by	the	department.	What	was	not	made	public	at	the	time	was	that	Jiliana
was	three	months	pregnant.	As	soon	as	she	disappeared,	her	live-in	boyfriend	told
her	parents	about	the	pregnancy.	They	kept	this	quiet	as	the	police	worked	around
the	clock	to	find	her.
Jiliana	has	not	been	heard	from.	Her	body	has	not	been	found.	She’s	probably
dead,	 but	 when	 was	 she	 murdered?	 The	 worst	 possible	 scenario	 is	 also	 the	 most
obvious:	 She	 wasn’t	 killed	 immediately	 but	 was	 held	 captive	 until	 after	 she	 gave
birth.
Nine	months	after	her	disappearance,	as	the	reward	money	continued	to	pile
up,	a	tip	led	the	police	to	a	pawnshop	not	far	from	my	apartment	building.	A	gold
necklace	with	a	small	Greek	coin	had	been	pawned	for	$200.	Jiliana’s	boyfriend
identified	the	necklace	as	the	one	he’d	given	her	the	previous	Christmas.	In	a	fullcourt	press,	detectives	worked	furiously	to	establish	a	chain	of	possession.	It	led	to
another	 pawnshop,	 to	 another	 transaction,	 and	 finally	 to	 a	 suspect	 named	 Arch
Swanger.
A	 thirty-one-year-old	 drifter	 with	 no	 apparent	 means	 of	 support,	 Swanger

had	 a	 history	 of	 petty	 thievery	 and	 small-time	 drug	 dealing.	 He	 lived	 in	 a	 rundown	 trailer	 park	 with	 his	 mother,	 who	 was	 a	 drunk	 drawing	 disability	 checks.
After	a	month	of	intense	surveillance	and	scrutiny,	Swanger	was	finally	brought	in
for	 questioning.	 He	 was	 evasive	 and	 coy,	 and	 after	 two	 hours	 of	 fruitless
interrogation	clammed	up	and	demanded	a	lawyer.	With	little	hard	evidence,	the
police	let	him	go	but	continued	to	monitor	his	every	movement.	Still,	he	managed
to	slip	away	several	times,	but	always	returned	home.
Last	week,	they	picked	him	up	again	for	questioning.	He	demanded	a	lawyer.
“Okay,	who’s	your	lawyer?”	the	detective	asked.
“That	guy	named	Rudd,	Sebastian	Rudd.”

3.
The	 last	 thing	 I	 need	 is	 more	 trouble	 with	 the	 police.	 But,	 as	 we	 say	 in	 the
trade,	we	don’t	always	get	to	choose	our	clients.	And	every	defendant,	regardless
of	 how	 despicable	 the	 person	 or	 his	 crime,	 is	 entitled	 to	 a	 lawyer.	 Most	 laymen
don’t	 understand	 this	 and	 don’t	 care.	 I	 don’t	 care	 either.	 This	 is	 my	 job.	 To	 be
honest,	I’m	initially	thrilled	Swanger	picked	me,	thrilled	to	be	allowed	to	stick	my
nose	smack	in	the	middle	of	another	sensational	case.
This	 one,	 though,	 will	 haunt	 me	 forever.	 I’ll	 curse	 the	 day	 I	 hustled	 over	 to
Central	to	have	my	first	chat	with	Arch	Swanger.
The	police	department	has	more	leaks	than	old	plumbing,	and	by	the	time	I
arrive	at	Central	word	is	out.	A	reporter	with	a	cameraman	catches	me	as	I	enter
the	building	and	demands	to	know	if	I	represent	Arch	Swanger.	I	offer	a	rude	“No
comment”	 and	 keep	 walking.	 From	 that	 moment	 on,	 though,	 everyone	 in	 town
knows	I’m	his	lawyer.	It’s	a	perfect	fit,	right?	A	monstrous	murderer	and	the	rogue
lawyer	who’ll	defend	anyone.
I’ve	 strolled	 through	 Central	 many	 times,	 and	 the	 place	 is	 always	 bustling
with	 an	 urgent	 energy.	 Street	 cops	 in	 uniforms	 rush	 around,	 bantering	 crudely
with	 those	 stuck	 behind	 desks.	 Detectives	 in	 cheap	 suits	 swagger	 through	 the
halls,	scowling	as	if	they’re	pissed	at	the	world.	Frightened	families	sit	on	benches
waiting	for	bad	news.	And	there’s	always	a	lawyer	huddled	up	with	a	cop	in	a	tense
negotiation,	or	hurrying	to	get	to	a	client	before	he	spills	his	guts.
Today,	 the	 air	 is	 especially	 heavy,	 the	 mood	 tense.	 I	 get	 more	 stares	 than
usual	when	I	walk	through	the	front	door.	And	why	not?	They’ve	caught	the	killer;
he’s	 just	 down	 the	 hall.	 And	 here	 comes	 his	 lawyer	 to	 save	 him.	 Both	 should	 be
grabbed	and	put	on	the	rack.
Present	 too	 is	 the	 lingering	 rawness	 of	 the	 Renfro	 trial.	 It	 was	 only	 three
weeks	ago	and	cops	have	long	memories.	Some	of	these	guys	would	like	to	take	a
nightstick	and	break	a	few	of	my	bones,	or	worse.
They	 lead	 me	 through	 the	 maze	 to	 the	 interrogation	 rooms.	 Down	 the	 hall,
smoking	and	looking	into	a	one-way	mirror,	are	two	homicide	detectives.	One	is
Landy	Reardon,	the	cop	who	called	me	with	the	news	that,	out	of	all	the	lawyers	in
the	 City,	 I	 had	 been	 chosen.	 Reardon	 is	 the	 best	 homicide	 detective	 in	 the
department.	He’s	nearing	retirement	now	and	the	years	have	taken	their	toll.	He’s
about	sixty	but	looks	ten	years	older,	with	thick	white	hair	that	goes	untouched	for
the	most	part.	He	still	smokes	and	has	the	jagged	wrinkles	as	proof.
He	sees	me	and	nods.	Come	on	over.	The	other	detective	disappears.
The	good	thing	about	Landy	Reardon	is	that	he	is	brutally	honest	and	will	not
waste	time	on	a	case	he	can’t	prove.	He	digs	hard	for	the	evidence,	but	if	it’s	not

there,	 then	 it’s	 not	 there.	 In	 thirty	 years,	 he’s	 never	 charged	 the	 wrong	 murder
suspect.	But	if	Landy	collars	you	for	murder,	the	judge	and	jury	will	fall	in	line	and
you’ll	probably	die	in	prison.
He’s	had	the	Jiliana	Kemp	case	since	the	beginning.	Four	months	ago,	he	had
a	mild	heart	attack	and	his	doctor	told	him	to	retire.	He	found	another	doctor.	I
stand	beside	him	and	both	of	us	look	through	the	mirror.	We	do	not	say	hello.	He
thinks	all	defense	lawyers	are	scum	and	would	never	stoop	to	shake	my	hand.
Swanger	 is	 alone	 in	 the	 interrogation	 room.	 He’s	 kicked	 back	 in	 his	 folding
chair	and	has	his	feet	on	the	table,	totally	bored	with	everything.	“What’s	he	said?”
I	ask.
“Nothing.	 Name,	 rank,	 and	 serial	 number,	 and	 after	 that	 he	 called	 for	 you.
Said	he	saw	your	name	in	the	newspaper.”
“So	he	can	read?”
“IQ	of	130,	I’d	guess.	He	just	looks	stupid.”
Indeed	he	does.	Plump	with	a	double	chin;	large	brown	freckles	from	the	neck
up;	 head	 practically	 shaved	 but	 for	 a	 few	 waxed	 bristles,	 like	 the	 old	 butch	 crew
cut	from	sixty	years	ago,	pre-Beatles.	To	attract	either	attention	or	ridicule,	he	is
wearing	a	pair	of	round-frame	glasses,	absurdly	large	and	aqua	blue	in	color.
“About	those	glasses,”	I	say.
“Drugstore,	 cheap	 and	 fake.	 He	 doesn’t	 need	 glasses	 but	 he	 fancies	 himself
clever	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 disguises.	 Actually,	 he’s	 pretty	 good.	 He’s	 slipped	 our
surveillance	a	few	times	in	the	past	month	but	always	comes	home.”
“What	do	you	have	on	him?”
Landy	exhales	in	fatigue	and	frustration.	“Not	much,”	he	says,	and	I	admire
the	guy’s	honesty.	He’s	a	brilliant	cop	and	knows	better	than	to	level	with	me,	but
he	inspires	confidence.
“Enough	for	an	indictment?”
“I	wish.	We’re	not	even	close	to	an	arrest.	Chief	wants	to	hold	him	for	a	week
or	two.	Crank	up	the	pressure,	you	know,	see	if	the	guy’ll	break.	But	really	to	see	if
lightning	will	strike	and	we	get	lucky.	Fat	chance.	We’ll	probably	let	him	go	again.
Between	me	and	you,	Rudd,	we	ain’t	got	much.”
“Seems	like	you	have	plenty	of	suspicion.”
Landy	 grunts	 and	 laughs.	 “We’re	 good	 at	 that.	 Look	 at	 him,	 talk	 about
suspicious.	I’d	give	him	ten	years	in	solitary	just	based	on	the	first	impression.”
“Maybe	five,”	I	say.
“Talk	to	him,	and	if	you	want,	I’ll	show	you	the	file	tomorrow.”
“Okay,	 I’m	 going	 in,	 but	 I’ve	 never	 met	 this	 guy	 and	 I’m	 not	 sure	 I’ll	 be	 his

lawyer.	 There’s	 always	 the	 issue	 of	 getting	 paid	 and	 he	 doesn’t	 look	 too
prosperous.	If	he’s	indigent,	PD	takes	over	and	I’m	out	of	the	picture.”
“Have	fun.”

4.
Swanger	 takes	 his	 feet	 off	 the	 desk,	 stands,	 and	 we	 make	 our	 introductions.
Firm	handshake,	eye	contact,	easy	voice	with	no	trace	of	concern.	Playing	it	cool,	I
restrain	myself	from	telling	him	to	take	off	those	damned	glasses.	If	he	likes	’em
then	I’m	crazy	about	’em.
“I	 saw	 you	 on	 TV,”	 he	 says.	 “That	 cage	 fighter	 that	 killed	 the	 ref.	 Whatever
happened	to	him?”
“The	case	is	still	pending,	waiting	for	a	trial.	You	go	to	cage	fights?”
“No.	 I	 watch	 ’em	 on	 TV	 with	 my	 mum.	 I	 thought	 about	 getting	 into	 it	 a	 few
years	back.”
I	 almost	 laugh.	 Even	 if	 he	 dropped	 thirty	 pounds	 and	 trained	 eight	 hours	 a
day,	 this	 guy	 wouldn’t	 last	 ten	 seconds	 in	 a	 cage.	 He’d	 probably	 faint	 in	 the
dressing	room.	I	sit	at	the	table,	empty-handed,	and	ask,	“Now,	what	did	you	want
to	talk	about?”
“That	 girl,	 man,	 you	 know	 the	 case.	 These	 guys	 think	 I’m	 involved	 in	 some
way	 and	 they’re	 hassling	 me.	 They’ve	 been	 on	 my	 ass	 for	 months	 now,	 always
hiding	in	the	shadows	as	if	I	don’t	know	what’s	going	on.	This	is	the	second	time
they’ve	hauled	me	in	here	like	something	on	television.	You	watch	Law	&	Order?
Well,	these	guys	have	watched	way	too	much	and	they’re	really	bad	actors,	know
what	I	mean?	That	old	one	with	the	white	hair,	Reardon	I	think,	he’s	the	good	guy,
always	just	looking	for	the	truth	and	trying	to	find	ways	to	help	me.	Right.	Then
the	skinny	one,	Barkley,	he’ll	come	in	and	start	yelling.	Back	and	forth.	Good	cop,
bad	cop,	like	I	don’t	know	the	game.	Ain’t	my	first	rodeo,	pal.”
“Your	first	murder	charge,	right?”
“Hang	on,	Superman.	I	ain’t	been	charged	yet.”
“Okay,	 assuming	 you	 are	 charged	 with	 murder,	 I	 take	 it	 you	 want	 me	 to
represent	you.”
“Well,	gee,	why	else	would	I	call	you,	Mr.	Rudd?	I’m	not	sure	I	need	a	lawyer
right	now	but	it	damned	sure	feels	like	it.”
“Understood.	Are	you	employed?”
“Here	and	there.	How	much	do	you	charge	for	a	murder	case?”
“Depends	 on	 how	 much	 a	 person	 can	 pay.	 A	 case	 like	 this,	 I’ll	 need	 ten
thousand	up	front	and	that’ll	just	get	us	through	the	indictment	phase.	Once	we’re
looking	 at	 a	 trial,	 then	 we	 get	 to	 the	 serious	 fee.	 If	 we	 can’t	 agree,	 then	 you	 go
elsewhere.”
“Where’s	elsewhere?”

“Public	defender’s	office.	They	handle	virtually	all	murders.”
“Figures.	But	what	you’re	not	factoring	in	here,	Mr.	Rudd,	is	all	the	publicity.
Ain’t	 too	 many	 cases	 as	 big	 as	 this	 one.	 Pretty	 girl,	 important	 family,	 and	 that
thing	with	the	baby.	If	she	had	a	kid,	then	where	is	it,	right?	That’ll	drive	the	press
crazy.	 So	 you	 gotta	 figure	 that	 this	 thing	 is	 front-page	 news,	 starting	 right	 about
now.	I’ve	seen	you	on	television.	I	know	how	much	you	love	to	bark	and	growl	and
strut	in	front	of	the	cameras.	This	case	will	be	a	gold	mine	for	my	defense	lawyer.
Don’t	you	agree,	Mr.	Rudd?”
He’s	 hammering	 the	 nail	 on	 the	 head,	 but	 I	 can’t	 admit	 this.	 I	 say,	 “I	 don’t
work	 for	 free,	 Mr.	 Swanger,	 regardless	 of	 the	 publicity.	 I	 have	 too	 many	 other
clients.”
“Of	course	you	do.	Big	lawyer	like	you.	I	didn’t	call	no	rookie	in	here	to	save
my	ass.	They’re	talking	death	penalty,	man,	and	they	mean	it.	I’ll	get	the	money,
one	way	or	the	other.	The	question	is,	will	you	take	my	case?”
Usually,	by	this	point	in	the	first	meeting,	the	accused	has	already	denied	the
charges.	 I	 make	 a	 mental	 note	 that	 Swanger	 has	 not	 done	 so,	 has	 not	 ventured
anywhere	 near	 the	 issue	 of	 his	 guilt	 or	 innocence.	 In	 fact,	 he	 seems	 to	 be
welcoming	an	indictment,	with	a	big	trial	to	follow.	I	say,	“Yes,	I’ll	represent	you,
assuming	we	can	come	to	terms	on	the	money	and	assuming	they	actually	indict
you.	I	think	they	have	a	ways	to	go.	In	the	meantime,	don’t	say	a	word	to	the	cops,
any	cop.	Understood?”
“Got	it,	man.	Can	you	get	them	to	back	off,	stop	the	harassment?”
“I’ll	see	what	I	can	do.”	We	shake	hands	again	and	I	leave	the	room.	Detective
Reardon	 has	 not	 moved.	 He’s	 watched	 our	 little	 meeting,	 and	 he’s	 probably
listened	 to	 it	 too,	 though	 that	 would	 be	 illegal.	 Standing	 next	 to	 him,	 in	 casual
clothes,	 is	 Roy	 Kemp,	 father	 of	 the	 missing	 girl.	 He	 glares	 at	 me	 with	 unbridled
hatred,	as	if	the	few	minutes	I	just	spent	with	their	first	and	rather	weak	suspect	is
clear	proof	that	I’m	involved	in	his	daughter’s	disappearance.
I	have	sympathy	for	the	man	and	his	family,	but	right	now	he	wants	to	put	a
bullet	in	the	back	of	my	head.
Outside	the	building,	more	reporters	have	gathered.	When	they	see	me	they
start	hopping	and	shoving.	I	brush	by	them	with	“No	comment,	no	comment,	no
comment,”	 as	 they	 lob	 their	 idiotic	 questions.	 One	 actually	 yells,	 “Mr.	 Rudd,	 did
your	client	abduct	Jiliana	Kemp?”	I	want	to	stop,	walk	over	to	this	clown,	and	ask
him	if	he	might	possibly	come	up	with	a	dumber	question.	But	instead	I	push	by
them	and	hop	in	the	van	with	Partner.

5.
At	six	o’clock,	the	anchormen	scream	the	news	that	the	police	have	a	suspect
in	the	Kemp	case.	They	show	footage	of	Arch	Swanger	being	mobbed	by	reporters
as	he	tries	to	leave	Central	not	long	after	I	did.	According	to	sources,	unnamed	of
course	 but	 undoubtedly	 from	 within	 the	 building,	 he’s	 been	 interrogated	 by	 the
police	 and	 will	 soon	 be	 arrested	 and	 charged	 with	 kidnapping	 and	 murder.	 To
prove	his	guilt,	he’s	hired	Sebastian	Rudd	to	defend	him!	They	show	me	scowling
at	the	cameras.
Finally,	the	City	can	breathe	easier.	The	police	have	the	killer.	To	relieve	the
enormous	pressure	on	them,	and	to	begin	the	process	of	poisoning	public	opinion,
and	 to	 establish	 the	 presumption	 of	 guilt,	 they	 are	 manipulating	 the	 press,	 as
always.	 A	 leak	 here	 and	 there	 and	 cameras	 show	 up	 to	 capture	 the	 face	 that
everyone	 has	 been	 desperate	 to	 see.	 The	 “journalists”	 chase	 their	 tails,	 and	 Arch
Swanger	is	as	good	as	convicted.
Why	bother	with	a	trial?
If	 the	 cops	 can’t	 convict	 with	 evidence,	 they	 use	 the	 media	 to	 convict	 with
suspicion.

6.
I	 spend	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 in	 a	 building	 officially	 and	 affectionately	 known	 as	 the
Old	 Courthouse.	 It’s	 a	 grand	 old	 structure,	 built	 around	 the	 turn	 of	 the	 century,
with	 soaring	 Gothic	 columns	 and	 high	 ceilings,	 wide	 marble	 hallways	 lined	 with
busts	 and	 portraits	 of	 dead	 judges,	 winding	 staircases,	 and	 four	 levels	 of
courtrooms	 and	 offices.	 It’s	 usually	 crawling	 with	 people—lawyers	 doing	 their
business,	 litigants	 searching	 for	 the	 right	 courtroom,	 families	 of	 criminal
defendants	wandering	fearfully	about,	potential	jurors	clutching	their	summonses,
and	 cops	 waiting	 to	 testify.	 There	 are	 five	 thousand	 lawyers	 in	 this	 city,	 and	 at
times	it	seems	as	though	every	one	of	us	is	hustling	around	the	Old	Courthouse.
As	I	leave	a	hearing	one	morning,	a	man	who	looks	vaguely	familiar	falls	in
beside	me	and	says,	“Hey,	Rudd,	got	a	minute?”
I	 don’t	 like	 his	 looks,	 his	 tone,	 or	 his	 rudeness.	 What	 about	 “Mr.	 Rudd”	 to
start	with?	I	keep	walking;	so	does	he.	“Have	we	met?”	I	ask.
“It	doesn’t	matter.	We	have	something	to	discuss.”
I	 glance	 at	 him	 as	 we	 walk.	 Bad	 suit,	 maroon	 shirt,	 hideous	 tie,	 a	 couple	 of
small	scars	on	his	face,	the	kind	left	behind	by	fists	and	beer	bottles.	“Oh	really,”	I
say	as	rudely	as	possible.
“Need	to	talk	about	Link.”
My	 brain	 tells	 me	 to	 keep	 walking	 but	 my	 feet	 simply	 stop	 moving.	 My
stomach	does	a	long,	nauseous	flip	as	my	heart	races	away.	I	stare	at	the	thug	and
say,	“Well,	well,	where	is	Link	these	days?”
It’s	been	two	months	since	his	dramatic	escape	from	death	row	and	I	haven’t
heard	 a	 word.	 Not	 that	 I	 would;	 however,	 I’m	 not	 completely	 surprised.
Frightened,	 maybe,	 but	 not	 shocked.	 We	 move	 to	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 hallway	 for
privacy.	The	thug	says	his	name	is	Fango,	and	there’s	a	10	percent	chance	Fango	is
the	name	on	his	birth	certificate.
In	 a	 corner,	 with	 my	 back	 to	 the	 wall	 so	 I	 can	 observe	 the	 foot	 traffic,	 we
converse	in	voices	that	are	low,	our	lips	barely	moving.	Fango	says,	“Link’s	having
a	 hard	 time	 of	 it,	 you	 know.	 Money’s	 tight,	 real	 tight,	 because	 the	 cops	 are
watching	 everybody	 even	 remotely	 connected	 to	 the	 businesses.	 They	 watch	 his
son,	his	people,	me,	everybody.	If	I	bought	a	plane	ticket	today	for	Miami,	the	cops
would	know	about	it.	Suffocating,	you	know	what	I	mean?”
Not	 really,	 but	 I	 just	 nod.	 He	 goes	 on,	 “Anyway,	 Link	 figures	 you	 owe	 him
some	 money.	 He	 paid	 you	 a	 pile,	 got	 nothing	 in	 return,	 you	 really	 screwed	 him,
you	know,	and	now	Link	wants	a	refund.”
I	fake	a	laugh	like	this	is	just	the	funniest	thing.	And	it	is	laughable—a	client

who	loses	wants	his	money	back	when	the	case	is	over.	Fango,	though,	is	not	in	a
humorous	mood.
“That’s	funny,”	I	say.	“And	how	much	of	a	refund?”
“All	of	it.	A	hundred	grand.	Cash.”
“I	see.	So	all	of	the	work	I	did	was	really	for	free,	is	that	it,	Fango?”
“Link	 would	 say	 that	 all	 of	 your	 work	 really	 sucked.	 Got	 him	 nowhere.	 He
hired	 you	 because	 you’re	 a	 hotshot	 gunslinger	 who	 was	 supposed	 to	 reverse	 his
conviction	and	get	him	off.	Didn’t	happen,	of	course,	in	fact	he	got	slammed	every
which	way.	He	thinks	you	did	a	lousy	job,	thus	the	refund.”
“Link	 got	 slammed	 because	 he	 killed	 a	 judge.	 Oddly	 enough,	 when	 this
happens,	and	it’s	quite	rare,	it	really	pisses	off	the	other	judges.	I	explained	all	this
to	Link	before	he	hired	me.	I	even	put	it	in	writing.	I	told	him	his	case	would	be
very	difficult	to	win	because	of	the	overwhelming	proof	the	State	had.	Sure	he	paid
me	in	cash,	but	I	put	it	on	the	books	and	sent	Uncle	Sam	about	a	third	of	it.	The
rest	of	it	was	spent	a	long	time	ago.	So,	there’s	nothing	left	for	Link.	Sorry.”
Partner	approaches	and	I	give	him	the	nod.	Fango	sees	him,	recognizes	him,
says,	“You	got	one	pit	bull,	Rudd,	Link	still	has	a	few	more.	You	got	thirty	days	to
get	the	money	together.	I’ll	be	back.”	He	turns	and	deliberately	brushes	by	Partner
as	 he	 leaves.	 Partner	 could	 break	 his	 neck,	 but	 I	 gesture	 for	 him	 to	 be	 cool.	 No
sense	 starting	 a	 fistfight	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 Old	 Courthouse,	 though	 I’ve	 seen
several	here.
Most	involved	angry	lawyers	taking	swings	at	each	other.

7.
Not	 long	 after	 Tadeo	 got	 famous	 for	 killing	 a	 referee,	 I	 began	 receiving
solicitations	from	doctors	claiming	to	be	expert	witnesses,	all	wanting	a	part	in	the
show.	There	were	a	total	of	four,	all	with	medical	degrees	and	impressive	résumés,
all	with	experience	in	courtrooms	in	front	of	juries.	They	had	read	about	the	case,
seen	the	video,	and,	to	varying	degrees,	all	offered	the	same	opinion;	to	wit,	Tadeo
was	legally	insane	when	he	attacked	Sean	King	in	the	ring.	He	did	not	understand
right	from	wrong,	nor	did	he	appreciate	the	nature	of	what	he	was	doing.
“Insanity”	is	a	legal	term,	not	a	medical	one.
I	talked	to	all	four,	did	some	research,	called	other	lawyers	who’d	used	them,
and	 settled	 upon	 a	 guy	 named	 Dr.	 Taslman,	 out	 of	 San	 Francisco.	 For	 $20,000,
plus	 expenses,	 he	 is	 willing	 to	 testify	 on	 Tadeo’s	 behalf	 and	 work	 his	 magic	 with
the	 jury.	 Though	 he	 has	 yet	 to	 meet	 the	 defendant,	 he’s	 already	 convinced	 he
knows	the	truth.
The	truth	can	be	expensive,	especially	when	it	comes	from	expert	witnesses.
Our	 system	 is	 chock-full	 of	 “experts”	 who	 do	 little	 in	 the	 way	 of	 teaching,
researching,	or	writing.	Instead,	they	roam	the	country	as	hired	guns	testifying	for
fat	 fees.	 Pick	 an	 issue,	 a	 set	 of	 facts,	 a	 mysterious	 cause,	 an	 unexplained	 result,
anything,	 really,	 and	 you	 can	 find	 a	 truckload	 of	 PhDs	 willing	 to	 testify	 with	 all
sorts	 of	 wild	 theories.	 They	 advertise.	 They	 solicit.	 They	 chase	 cases.	 They	 hang
around	conventions	where	lawyers	gather	to	drink	and	compare	notes.	They	brag
about	“their	verdicts.”
Their	losses	are	rarely	mentioned.
They	are	occasionally	discredited	by	nasty	cross-examinations,	in	open	court,
but	they	stay	in	business	because	they	are	so	often	effective.	In	a	criminal	trial,	an
expert	has	to	convince	only	one	juror	to	hang	things	up	and	cause	a	mistrial.	Hang
it	again	on	the	retrial,	and	the	State	will	usually	throw	in	the	towel.
I	 meet	 Tadeo	 in	 a	 visiting	 room	 at	 the	 jail,	 our	 usual	 spot,	 and	 discuss	 Dr.
Taslman’s	 possible	 role	 in	 his	 defense.	 The	 expert	 will	 testify	 that	 he,	 Tadeo,
blacked	 out,	 went	 crazy,	 and	 has	 no	 recollection	 of	 what	 happened.	 Tadeo	 likes
this	new	theory.	Yes,	come	to	think	of	it,	he	really	was	insane.	I	mention	the	fee
and	 he	 says	 he’s	 broke.	 I’ve	 already	 mentioned	 my	 fee,	 and	 he	 was	 even	 broker.
Needless	to	say,	I’ll	represent	Tadeo	Zapate	simply	because	I	love	him.	That,	and
the	publicity.
It’s	the	O.	J.	Simpson	theory	of	legal	fees:	I’m	not	paying	you;	you’re	lucky	to
be	here;	go	make	a	buck	with	your	book.
Using	 Harry	 &	 Harry’s	 paperwork,	 I	 file	 the	 proper	 notice	 telling	 the	 court
that	we	will	be	relying	on	an	insanity	defense.	Mr.	Ace	Prosecutor,	Max	Mancini,

howls	 in	 response,	 as	 always.	 Max	 is	 fully	 in	 control	 of	 the	 Zapate	 matter,
primarily	because	of	the	overwhelming	proof	of	guilt,	as	well	as	the	publicity.	He’s
still	offering	fifteen	years	for	second-degree	murder.	I’m	stuck	on	ten,	though	I’m
not	sure	my	client	would	plead	to	that.	As	the	weeks	have	passed	and	Tadeo	has
become	the	beneficiary	of	hours	of	free	jailhouse	legal	advice,	he	has	become	even
more	rigid	in	his	belief	that	I	can	somehow	pull	the	right	strings	and	walk	him	out.
He	wants	one	of	those	technicalities	all	of	his	cell	mates	know	about.
Dr.	 Taslman	 comes	 to	 town	 and	 we	 have	 lunch.	 He’s	 a	 retired	 psychiatrist
who	never	liked	to	teach	or	listen	to	patients.	Legal	insanity	has	always	fascinated
him—the	crime	of	passion,	the	irresistible	impulse,	the	moment	when	the	mind	is
so	filled	with	emotion	and	hate	that	it	commands	the	body	to	act	violently	and	in	a
way	never	contemplated.	He	prefers	to	do	all	the	talking.	It’s	his	way	of	convincing
me	 how	 brilliant	 he	 is.	 I	 listen	 to	 his	 bullshit	 as	 I	 try	 to	 analyze	 how	 a	 jury	 will
react	to	him.	He’s	likeable,	intense,	smart,	and	a	good	conversationalist.	Plus,	he’s
from	California,	two	thousand	miles	away.	All	trial	lawyers	know	that	the	greater
the	distance	an	expert	travels,	the	more	credibility	he	has	with	the	jury.
I	write	him	a	check	for	half	of	his	fee.	The	other	half	will	be	due	at	trial.
He	 spends	 two	 hours	 evaluating	 Tadeo,	 and,	 surprise,	 surprise,	 he	 is	 now
certain	 the	 kid	 blacked	 out,	 went	 crazy,	 and	 does	 not	 remember	 pummeling	 the
referee.
So	we	now	have	a	defense,	shaky	as	it	is.	I’m	not	that	encouraged	because	the
State	will	haul	in	two	or	three	experts,	all	at	least	as	credible	as	Taslman,	and	they
will	overwhelm	us	with	their	brilliance.	Tadeo	will	testify	and	do	a	credible	job	on
direct,	perhaps	even	manage	some	tears,	then	he’ll	get	chewed	up	by	Mancini	on
cross-examination.
But	the	video	doesn’t	lie.	I’m	still	convinced	the	jurors	will	watch	it	over	and
over	and	see	the	truth.	They	will	silently	scoff	at	Taslman	and	laugh	at	Tadeo,	and
they	will	return	a	verdict	of	guilty.	Guilty	means	twenty	to	thirty	years.	On	the	day
of	the	trial,	I’ll	probably	get	the	prosecutor	down	to	twelve	to	fifteen	years.
How	 can	 I	 convince	 a	 headstrong	 twenty-two-year-old	 to	 plead	 guilty	 to
fifteen	years?	Scare	him	with	thirty?	I	doubt	it.	The	great	Tadeo	Zapate	has	never
scared	easily.

8.
Today	is	Starcher’s	eighth	birthday.	The	battered	and	abused	court	order	that
dictates	the	time	I	spend	with	my	son	clearly	says	that	I	get	two	hours	with	him	on
each	of	his	birthdays.
Two	 hours	 is	 too	 much,	 according	 to	 his	 mother.	 She	 thinks	 one	 hour	 is
plenty;	 actually,	 no	 time	 would	 be	 her	 preference.	 Shoving	 me	 out	 of	 his	 life
completely	is	her	goal,	but	I	won’t	let	that	happen.	I	may	be	a	pathetic	father,	but	I
am	trying.	And,	there	might	come	a	day	when	the	kid	wants	to	spend	time	with	me
in	order	to	get	away	from	his	quarreling	mothers.
So	 I’m	 sitting	 at	 a	 McDonald’s,	 waiting	 to	 begin	 my	 two	 hours.	 Judith
eventually	pulls	up	in	her	Jaguar,	her	lawyer	car,	and	gets	out	with	Starcher.	She
marches	 him	 inside,	 sees	 me,	 scowls	 as	 if	 she’d	 rather	 be	 anywhere	 else,	 and
hands	him	over.	“I’ll	be	back	at	five	o’clock,”	she	hisses	at	me.
“It’s	 already	 four-fifteen,”	 I	 say,	 but	 she	 doesn’t	 acknowledge	 me.	 She	 huffs
away,	and	he	takes	a	seat	opposite	me.	I	smile	and	say,	“How’s	it	going,	bud?”
“Okay,”	 he	 mumbles,	 almost	 afraid	 to	 speak	 to	 his	 father.	 I	 cannot	 imagine
the	 strict	 orders	 she	 hit	 him	 with	 during	 the	 drive	 over.	 Do	 not	 eat	 the	 food.	 Do
not	 drink	 the	 drinks.	 Do	 not	 play	 on	 the	 playground.	 Wash	 your	 hands.	 Do	 not
answer	questions	if	“he”	quizzes	you	about	me	or	Ava	or	anything	to	do	with	our
home.	Do	not	have	a	good	time.
It	 usually	 takes	 him	 a	 few	 minutes	 to	 shake	 off	 this	 drubbing	 before	 he	 can
relax	around	me.
“Happy	birthday,”	I	say.
“Thanks.”
“Mom	 tells	 me	 you’re	 having	 a	 big	 party	 on	 Saturday.	 Lots	 of	 kids	 and	 cake
and	stuff	like	that.	Should	be	fun.”
“I	guess,”	he	says.
I	 wasn’t	 invited	 to	 the	 party,	 of	 course.	 It’s	 at	 his	 home,	 the	 place	 where	 he
lives	half	his	life	with	Judith	and	Ava.	A	place	I’ve	never	seen.
“Are	you	hungry?”
He	 looks	 around.	 It’s	 a	 McDonald’s,	 a	 kid’s	 paradise,	 where	 everything	 is
carefully	designed	to	make	people	crave	the	food	that	looks	far	more	delicious	on
the	 walls	 than	 on	 the	 tables.	 He	 zeroes	 in	 on	 a	 large	 poster	 hawking	 a	 new	 ice
cream	float	called	the	McGlacier.	Looks	pretty	good.	I	say,	“I	think	I’ll	try	one	of
those.	You?”
“Mom	says	I	shouldn’t	eat	anything	here.	Says	it’s	all	bad	for	me.”

This	 is	 my	 time,	 not	 Judith’s.	 I	 smile	 and	 lean	 forward	 as	 if	 we’re	 now
conspirators.	“But	Mom’s	not	here,	right?	I	won’t	tell,	you	won’t	tell.	Just	us	boys,
okay?”
He	grins	and	says,	“Okay.”
From	under	the	table	I	pull	out	a	box	that’s	covered	in	birthday	wrapping	and
place	it	on	the	table.	“This	is	for	you,	bud.	Happy	birthday.	Go	ahead	and	open	it.”
He	grabs	it	as	I	head	toward	the	counter.
When	I	return	with	the	floats,	he’s	staring	at	a	small	backgammon	board	on
the	 table.	 When	 I	 was	 a	 boy,	 my	 grandfather	 taught	 me	 to	 play	 checkers,	 then
backgammon,	then	chess.	I	was	fascinated	with	board	games	of	all	varieties.	As	a
kid,	I	received	board	games	for	birthdays	and	Christmas.	By	the	time	I	was	ten,	I
had	stacks	of	them	in	my	room,	a	vast	collection	that	I	took	meticulous	care	of.	I
seldom	 lost	 at	 any	 of	 the	 games.	 My	 favorite	 became	 backgammon,	 and	 I	 would
pester	my	grandfather,	my	mother,	my	friends,	anyone,	really,	to	play.	When	I	was
twelve,	I	came	in	third	place	in	a	city	tournament	for	kids.	When	I	was	eighteen,	I
was	competing	well	in	adult	tournaments.	In	college,	I	played	for	money	until	the
other	students	stopped	gambling	with	me.
I’m	hoping	some	of	this	might	rub	off	on	my	son.	It’s	becoming	apparent	that
he	 will	 almost	 certainly	 look	 like	 me,	 walk	 like	 me,	 and	 talk	 like	 me.	 He’s	 very
bright,	though	I	must	admit	he	gets	a	lot	of	that	from	his	mother.	Judith	and	Ava
are	 keeping	 him	 away	 from	 video	 games.	 After	 the	 Renfro	 trial,	 I	 am	 thrilled	 by
this.
“What’s	this?”	he	asks,	taking	his	McGlacier	and	looking	at	the	board.
“It’s	called	backgammon,	a	board	game	that’s	been	around	for	centuries.	I’m
going	to	teach	you	how	to	play.”
“Looks	hard,”	he	says	as	he	takes	a	spoonful.
“It’s	not.	I	started	playing	it	when	I	was	eight	years	old.	You’ll	catch	on.”
“All	right,”	he	says,	ready	for	the	challenge.	I	arrange	the	checkers	and	start
with	the	basics.

9.
Partner	parks	our	van	in	a	crowded	lot	and	walks	into	the	mall.	He’ll	enter	a
two-story	 restaurant	 that	 anchors	 one	 wing	 of	 the	 mall,	 and	 he’ll	 find	 a	 window
seat	in	a	small	bar	area	on	the	upper	level.	From	there,	he’ll	watch	the	van	to	see
who	else	is	watching	the	van.
At	4:00	p.m.,	Arch	Swanger	knocks	on	the	sliding	door.	I	open	it.	Welcome	to
my	office.	He	takes	a	seat	in	a	comfortable	recliner	and	looks	around.	He	smiles	at
the	 leather,	 the	 television,	 the	 stereo,	 the	 sofa,	 the	 refrigerator.	 “Pretty	 cool,”	 he
says.	“Is	this	really	your	office?”
“It	is.”
“I	 figured	 a	 big	 shot	 like	 you	 would	 have	 a	 fancy	 office	 in	 one	 of	 those	 tall
buildings	downtown.”
“I	had	one	once,	but	it	got	firebombed.	Now	I	prefer	a	moving	target.”
He	 stares	 at	 me	 for	 a	 second	 as	 if	 he’s	 not	 sure	 I’m	 serious.	 The	 goofy	 blue
glasses	have	been	replaced	by	black	readers	that	actually	succeed	in	making	him
appear	somewhat	more	intelligent.	He’s	wearing	a	black	felt	driving	cap	that	looks
authentic.	It’s	a	nice	look,	an	effective	disguise.	From	ten	feet	away	you	wouldn’t
know	it	was	the	same	guy.	He	says,	“Really,	your	office	was	firebombed?”
“It	 was,	 about	 five	 years	 ago.	 Don’t	 ask	 who	 because	 I	 don’t	 know.	 It	 was
either	a	drug	dealer	or	some	undercover	cops.	Personally,	I	think	it	was	the	narcs
because	 the	 police	 showed	 little	 enthusiasm	 when	 it	 came	 to	 investigating	 the
fire.”
“You	see,	that’s	what	I	like	about	you,	Mr.	Rudd.	Can	I	call	you	Sebastian?”
“I	prefer	Mr.	Rudd,	until	I’m	hired.	After	that,	you	can	call	me	Sebastian.”
“Okay,	 Mr.	 Rudd,	 I	 like	 it	 that	 the	 cops	 don’t	 like	 you	 and	 you	 don’t	 like
them.”
“I	 know	 a	 lot	 of	 the	 guys	 on	 the	 force	 and	 we	 get	 along	 fine,”	 I	 say,	 fudging
just	a	little.	I	like	Nate	Spurio	and	a	couple	of	others.	“Let’s	talk	business.	I’ve	had
a	chat	with	the	detective,	our	pal	Landy	Reardon,	and	they	don’t	have	much	in	the
way	of	evidence.	They’re	pretty	sure	you’re	the	guy;	they	just	can’t	prove	it	yet.”
This	 would	 be	 the	 perfect	 time	 for	 him	 to	 deny	 his	 guilt.	 Something	 simple
and	 thoroughly	 unoriginal	 like	 “They	 got	 the	 wrong	 guy”	 would	 be	 appropriate.
Instead,	he	says,	“I’ve	had	lawyers	before,	several	of	them,	most	appointed	by	the
court,	and	I	never	felt	like	I	could	trust	them,	you	know?	But	I	feel	like	I	can	trust
you,	Mr.	Rudd.”
“Back	 to	 the	 deal,	 Arch.	 For	 a	 fee	 of	 $10,000	 I’ll	 represent	 you	 through	 the

indictment	stage.	Once	you’re	indicted,	and	facing	a	trial,	my	representation	will
end.	At	that	point	we’ll	sit	down	to	discuss	our	future	together.”
“I	 don’t	 have	 $10,000	 and	 I	 think	 that’s	 too	 much	 just	 to	 get	 to	 the
indictment.	I	know	how	the	system	works.”
He’s	not	completely	wrong	about	this.	Ten	grand	for	the	initial	skirmishes	is	a
bit	steep,	but	I	always	start	on	the	high	side.	“I’m	not	going	to	negotiate,	Arch.	I’m
a	busy	lawyer	with	a	lot	of	clients.”
From	his	shirt	pocket	he	pulls	out	a	folded	check.	“Here’s	five	thousand,	from
my	mother’s	account.	It’s	the	best	we	can	do.”
I	unfold	the	check.	Local	bank.	Five	grand.	Signed	by	Louise	Powell.	He	says,
“Powell	 was	 her	 third	 husband,	 dead.	 My	 parents	 divorced	 when	 I	 was	 a	 kid.
Haven’t	seen	my	dear	old	dad	in	a	long	time.”
Five	grand	keeps	me	in	the	game	and	in	the	news	and	it’s	not	a	bad	fee	for	the
first	 round	 or	 two.	 I	 refold	 the	 check,	 stick	 it	 in	 my	 shirt	 pocket,	 and	 pull	 out	 a
contract	 for	 legal	 services.	 My	 cell	 phone	 is	 sitting	 on	 the	 small	 table	 in	 front	 of
me.	It	vibrates.	Partner’s	calling.	“Excuse	me	a	second.	I	gotta	take	this.”
“It’s	your	office.”
Partner	says,	“You	got	two	cops	in	a	white	Jeep	fifty	feet	away,	just	pulled	in
and	watching	the	van.”
“Thanks.	Keep	me	posted.”	I	tell	Swanger,	“Your	buddies	picked	up	your	tail.
They	 know	 you’re	 here	 and	 they	 know	 my	 van.	 Nothing	 wrong	 with	 a	 lawyer
meeting	with	his	client.”
He	 shakes	 his	 head	 and	 says,	 “They	 follow	 me	 everywhere.	 You	 gotta	 help
me.”
I	slowly	walk	him	through	the	contract.	When	everything	is	clear,	both	of	us
sign	 it.	 For	 good	 measure	 I	 say,	 “I’m	 going	 straight	 to	 the	 bank.	 If	 the	 check
doesn’t	clear,	the	contract	is	void.	Understand?”
“You	think	I’d	write	a	bad	check?”
I	can’t	help	but	smile.	I	reply,	“Your	mother	wrote	it.	I	don’t	take	chances.”
“She	drinks	too	much	but	she’s	not	a	crook.”
“I’m	sorry,	Arch.	I	didn’t	mean	to	imply	that.	It’s	just	that	I	see	my	share	of
bad	checks.”
He	waves	me	off	and	says,	“Whatever.”
We	stare	at	the	table	for	a	minute	or	so,	and	I	finally	say,	“Is	there	something
you’d	like	to	talk	about,	now	that	you	have	a	lawyer?”
“You	got	a	beer	in	that	cute	little	fridge?”
I	reach	over,	open	the	door,	and	pull	out	a	can	of	beer.	He	pops	the	top	and

takes	a	long	swig.	He	likes	it,	says	with	a	laugh,	“I	guess	this	is	the	most	expensive
beer	I’ve	ever	had.”
“That’s	 one	 way	 of	 looking	 at	 it.	 Keep	 in	 mind	 that	 no	 other	 lawyer	 would
serve	you	a	drink	in	his	office.”
“Got	that	right.	You’re	the	first.”	Another	gulp.	“So,	Sebastian,	it	is	Sebastian
now,	right,	now	that	I’ve	forked	over	the	fee	and	we’ve	signed	a	contract?”
“Sebastian	works.”
“Okay,	 Sebastian,	 in	 addition	 to	 some	 beer,	 what	 do	 I	 get	 for	 five	 thousand
bucks?”
“Legal	advice,	for	starters.	And	protection—the	cops	won’t	be	tempted	to	drag
you	in	and	rough	you	up	in	one	of	their	infamous	ten-hour	interrogations.	It’ll	be
hands	off	as	they	play	it	by	the	book.	I	have	a	relationship	with	Detective	Reardon
and	I’ll	try	to	convince	him	that	they	don’t	have	enough	evidence	to	move	forward.
If	they	find	any	evidence,	chances	are	I’ll	know	about	it.”
He	 turns	 the	 can	 up,	 drains	 it,	 wipes	 his	 mouth	 with	 a	 sleeve.	 A	 thirsty	 frat
boy	 could	 not	 have	 finished	 the	 beer	 any	 faster.	 It’s	 another	 perfect	 moment	 for
him	 to	 say	 something	 like	 “There	 is	 no	 evidence.”	 Instead,	 he	 belches	 and	 says,
“And	if	I’m	arrested?”
“Then	 I’ll	 be	 at	 the	 jail	 trying	 to	 get	 you	 out,	 which	 will	 be	 impossible.	 A
charge	of	murder	in	this	city	means	no	bail.	I’ll	file	a	bunch	of	motions	and	make
some	 noise.	 I	 have	 friends	 at	 the	 newspaper	 and	 I’ll	 leak	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 police
have	little	in	the	way	of	evidence.	I’ll	start	intimidating	the	prosecutor.”
“Doesn’t	sound	like	much	for	$5,000.	Could	I	have	another	beer?”
I	hesitate	for	a	second	and	quickly	decide	that	two	will	be	his	limit,	at	least	in
my	office.	I	hand	him	another	can	and	say,	“I’ll	refund	the	money	right	now,	Arch,
if	you’re	unhappy	with	our	arrangement.	As	I’ve	said,	I’m	a	busy	lawyer	with	a	lot
of	clients.	Five	thousand	bucks	is	not	going	to	change	my	life.”
He	pops	the	top	and	takes	a	reasonable	sip.
I	ask,	“You	want	the	check	back?”
“No.”
“Then	stop	bitching	about	the	fee.”
He	glares	at	me	and	for	the	first	time	I	catch	the	cold,	hollow	stare	of	a	killer.
I’ve	 seen	 it	 before.	 He	 says,	 “They’re	 gonna	 kill	 me,	 Sebastian.	 The	 cops	 can’t
prove	 anything,	 they	 can’t	 find	 their	 man,	 and	 they’re	 under	 a	 ton	 of	 pressure.
They’re	afraid	of	me	because	if	they	arrest	me	then	they	have	to	deal	with	you,	and
since	 they	 have	 no	 evidence	 they	 don’t	 want	 to	 go	 to	 trial.	 Imagine	 a	 not-guilty
verdict	after	a	huge	trial.	So,	to	sort	of	short-circuit	everything,	they’re	just	gonna
take	me	out	and	save	everyone	the	trouble.	I	know	this	because	they’ve	told	me.

Not	 Detective	 Reardon.	 Not	 the	 big	 shots	 down	 at	 Central.	 But	 the	 cops	 on	 the
street,	some	of	those	guys	who	follow	me	nonstop,	twenty-four	seven.	They	even
watch	 the	 trailer	 when	 I’m	 asleep.	 They	 harass	 me,	 cuss	 me,	 threaten	 me.	 And	 I
know	 they’re	 gonna	 kill	 me,	 Sebastian.	 You	 know	 how	 rotten	 this	 department
really	is.”	He	goes	silent	as	he	takes	another	drink.
“I	doubt	that,”	I	say.	“Sure,	we	have	some	bad	apples,	but	I’ve	never	known
them	to	rub	out	a	murder	suspect	just	because	they	couldn’t	nail	him.”
“I	know	a	guy	they	killed,	a	drug	dealer.	Made	it	look	like	a	botched	delivery.”
“I’m	not	going	to	argue	about	this.”
“Here’s	 the	 problem,	 Sebastian.	 If	 they	 put	 a	 bullet	 in	 my	 head,	 then	 they’ll
never	find	that	girl’s	body.”
My	stomach	flips	but	I	remain	stone-faced.	It’s	customary	for	the	accused	to
deny	guilt.	It’s	unheard	of	for	him	to	admit	to	the	crime,	especially	at	such	an	early
stage.	I	never	ask	criminal	defendants	if	they’re	guilty;	it’s	a	waste	of	time	and	they
lie	anyway.	I	proceed	carefully	with	“So	you	know	where	her	body	is?”
“Let	me	get	this	straight,	Sebastian.	You’re	now	my	lawyer	and	I	can	tell	you
anything,	right?	If	I	killed	ten	girls	and	hid	their	bodies	and	told	you	all	about	it,
you	couldn’t	repeat	a	word,	right?”
“That’s	right.”
“Never?”
“There’s	 only	 one	 exception	 to	 the	 rule.	 If	 you	 tell	 me	 something	 in
confidence,	and	I	believe	that	it	will	endanger	other	people,	then	I	am	allowed	to
repeat	it	to	the	authorities.	Other	than	that,	I	can	never	tell.”
Satisfied,	he	smiles	and	takes	a	drink.	“Relax,	I	didn’t	kill	ten	girls.	And	I’m
not	saying	I	killed	Jiliana	Kemp	either,	but	I	know	where	she’s	buried.”
“Do	you	know	who	killed	her?”
He	 pauses,	 says	 yes,	 then	 goes	 silent	 again.	 It’s	 obvious	 he’s	 not	 naming
names.	 I	 reach	 into	 the	 fridge	 and	 get	 a	 beer	 for	 myself.	 We	 drink	 for	 a	 few
minutes.	 He	 watches	 every	 move,	 as	 if	 he	 knows	 my	 heart	 is	 pounding	 away.
Finally,	 I	 say,	 “Okay,	 I’m	 not	 asking	 for	 any	 information,	 but	 do	 you	 think	 it’s
important	for	someone,	maybe	me,	to	know	where	she	is?”
“Yes,	but	I	have	to	think	about	it.	Maybe	I’ll	tell	you	tomorrow.	Maybe	not.”
My	 thoughts	 turn	 directly	 to	 the	 Kemp	 family	 and	 their	 unspeakable
nightmare.	At	this	moment	I	hate	this	guy	and	would	love	to	see	him	locked	up,	or
worse.	Sipping	a	beer	in	my	van	like	he’s	Joe	Cool	while	the	family	suffers.
“When	was	she	killed?”	I	asked,	pushing	it.
“I’m	not	sure.	I	didn’t	do	it,	I	swear.	But	she	did	not	give	birth	in	captivity,	if

that’s	what	you	want	to	know.	There	was	no	baby	sold	on	the	black	market.”
“You	know	a	lot,	don’t	you?”
“I	know	too	much	and	it’s	about	to	get	me	killed.	I	may	have	to	disappear,	you
know?”
“Taking	 flight	 is	 a	 clear	 sign	 of	 guilt.	 It	 will	 be	 used	 against	 you	 in	 court.	 I
wouldn’t	advise	it.”
“So	you	want	me	to	stay	here	and	take	a	bullet.”
“The	cops	do	not	kill	murder	suspects,	okay,	Arch?	Trust	me	on	this.”
He	crushes	his	can	and	leaves	it	on	the	table.	“I	got	nothing	else	to	say	right
now,	Sebastian.	I’ll	see	you	later.”
“You	have	my	number.”
He	opens	the	door	and	gets	out.	Partner	watches	him	as	he	glances	around,
looks	for	the	cops,	then	enters	the	mall	and	disappears.
Partner	and	I	drive	straight	to	the	bank.	The	check	is	no	good.	I	call	Arch	for
an	 hour	 and	 finally	 get	 him.	 He	 apologizes	 and	 promises	 the	 check	 will	 be	 good
tomorrow.	Something	tells	me	I’d	be	a	fool	to	believe	him.

10.
It’s	4:33	in	the	morning	and	my	phone	is	ringing.	I	grab	it	and	don’t	recognize
the	number.	This	is	always	trouble.	“Hello,”	I	say.
“Hey,	Sebastian,	it’s	me,	Arch.	Got	a	minute?”
Of	course,	Arch.	Oddly	enough,	I’m	not	that	busy	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	I
take	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 say,	 “Sure,	 Arch,	 I	 have	 a	 minute.	 But	 it’s	 four	 in	 the
morning,	so	this	better	be	good.”
“I’m	 out	 of	 town,	 okay,	 officially	 on	 the	 run.	 I	 shook	 ’em	 off	 and	 slipped
through	their	net,	and	I’m	not	coming	back,	so	they’ll	never	catch	me.”
“Big	mistake,	Arch.	Better	find	yourself	a	new	lawyer.”
“You’re	my	lawyer,	Sebastian.”
“The	check	is	rubber,	Arch.	Remember	what	I	said?”
“You	still	have	it,	run	it	through	today.	I	swear	it’ll	clear.”	His	words	are	fast
and	clipped,	and	he	sounds	as	though	he’d	been	running.	“Look,	Sebastian,	I	want
you	to	know	where	that	girl	is,	okay?	Just	in	case	something	happens	to	me.	There
are	others	involved,	and	I	could	easily	end	up	on	the	short	end	of	the	stick,	know
what	I	mean?”
“Not	really.”
“I	can’t	explain	all	of	it,	Sebastian.	It’s	complicated.	I	got	folks	after	me,	cops
as	well	as	some	guys	who	make	cops	look	like	Cub	Scouts.”
“Too	bad,	Arch.	I	can’t	help	you.”
“You	ever	see	that	billboard	down	the	interstate,	about	an	hour	south	of	here,
big	 bright	 sign	 in	 a	 cornfield,	 says,	 ‘Vasectomy	 Reversals.’	 You	 ever	 see	 it,
Sebastian?”
“I	 don’t	 think	 so.”	 Every	 reasonable	 thought	 and	 instinct	 tells	 me	 to	 cancel
this	 call	 immediately.	 Just	 hang	 up,	 stupid.	 And	 never	 speak	 to	 him	 again.
Physically,	though,	I	freeze	and	cannot	do	it.
His	 voice	 is	 animated	 now,	 as	 if	 he’s	 thoroughly	 enjoying	 this.	 “ ‘Vasectomy
Reversals	by	Dr.	Woo.	All	insurance	accepted.	Call	twenty-four	hours	a	day.	Tollfree	number.’	That’s	where	she’s	buried,	Sebastian,	under	that	billboard,	right	next
to	 a	 cornfield.	 My	 father	 had	 a	 vasectomy	 two	 years	 before	 I	 was	 born,	 not	 sure
what	went	wrong	and	my	mother	was	certainly	perplexed.	Maybe	she	was	seeing
someone	on	the	side.	So	who’s	my	daddy,	right?	I	guess	we’ll	never	know.	Anyway,
I’ve	 always	 had	 this	 fascination	 with	 vasectomies.	 A	 snip	 here	 and	 a	 snip	 there,
drive	 yourself	 home	 and	 shoot	 blanks	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 your	 life.	 Such	 a	 simple
procedure	but	such	dramatic	results.	You	had	the	Big	V,	Sebastian?”

“No.”
“Didn’t	think	so.	You’re	such	a	stud.”
“So	you	buried	her,	is	that	what	you’re	saying,	Arch?”
“Ain’t	 saying	 anything,	 Sebastian.	 Except	 good-bye	 and	 thanks	 for	 keeping
this	a	secret.	I’ll	check	in	later.”

11.
I	wrap	myself	in	a	blanket	and	sit	outside	on	the	small	terrace.	It’s	cold	and
dark	 and	 the	 streets	 far	 below	 are	 quiet	 and	 empty.	 In	 moments	 like	 these,	 I
wonder	why	I	became	a	criminal	defense	lawyer.	Why	have	I	chosen	to	spend	my
life	 trying	 to	 protect	 people	 who,	 for	 the	 most	 part,	 have	 done	 horrible	 things?	 I
can	justify	it	on	the	usual	grounds,	but	at	times	like	this	my	heart	is	not	really	in	it.
I	 think	 about	 architecture	 school,	 my	 second	 choice.	 But	 then,	 I	 know	 some
architects	and	they	have	their	own	issues.
First	scenario:	Swanger	is	telling	the	truth.	In	that	case,	am	I	bound	by	ethics
and	duty	to	stay	quiet?	Hand	in	hand	is	the	question,	am	I	really	his	lawyer?	No
and	yes.	We	signed	a	contract,	but	he	breached	the	contract	by	paying	with	a	bad
check.	No	contract	means	no	representation,	but	it’s	never	that	clear.	I	met	with
him	 on	 two	 occasions,	 and	 during	 both	 he	 considered	 me	 to	 be	 his	 lawyer.	 Both
were	 clearly	 lawyer-client	 meetings.	 He	 asked	 for	 advice.	 I	 gave	 it.	 He	 followed
most	 of	 it.	 He	 confided	 in	 me.	 When	 he	 told	 me	 about	 the	 body,	 he	 certainly
thought	he	was	talking	to	his	lawyer.
Second	scenario:	Let’s	say	I’m	his	lawyer,	I	never	see	him	again,	and	I	decide
to	 tell	 the	 police	 what	 he	 told	 me.	 It	 would	 be	 a	 serious	 breach	 of	 client	 trust,
probably	enough	to	get	me	disbarred.	But	who	will	complain?	If	he’s	on	the	run,	or
dead,	how	much	trouble	can	he	cause	me?
Third	scenario:	Plenty.	If	the	body	is	where	he	says	it	is,	and	I	tell	the	police,
then	Swanger	will	be	hunted,	found,	tried,	convicted,	and	given	death.	He	would
blame	me,	and	he	would	be	correct.	My	career	would	be	over.
Fourth	scenario:	I	cannot	tell	the	police,	under	any	circumstances.	They	don’t
know	what	I	know,	and	I’m	not	about	to	tell	them.	I	think	about	the	Kemp	family
and	 their	 nightmare,	 but	 there’s	 no	 way	 I	 can	 break	 a	 confidential	 relationship.
With	luck,	the	family	will	never	know	that	I	know.
Fifth	 scenario:	 Swanger	 is	 lying.	 He	 seemed	 too	 anxious	 to	 tell	 me.	 He’s
playing	games	and	sucking	me	into	some	awful	scheme	that	will	only	end	badly.
He	knew	the	check	would	bounce.	His	poor	mother	has	never	seen	$5,000	in	her
life,	nor	has	he.
Sixth	 scenario:	 Swanger	 is	 not	 lying.	 I	 can	 leak	 the	 information	 to	 Nate
Spurio,	my	mole	deep	in	the	department.	The	body	will	be	found.	Swanger	will	be
caught	and	put	on	trial	and	I	will	be	nowhere	near	the	courthouse.	If	he	killed	the
girl,	I	want	him	locked	up.
I	 kick	 around	 several	 other	 scenarios	 and	 things	 get	 foggier,	 not	 clearer.	 At
5:30,	 I	 put	 on	 the	 coffee.	 While	 it	 brews	 I	 rack	 all	 fifteen	 balls	 and	 break	 with	 a
rather	 soft	 shot.	 The	 neighbor	 next	 door	 has	 complained	 about	 the	 noise	 of

clacking	balls	at	weird	hours,	so	I	work	on	my	finesse	game.	I	run	the	table,	sink
the	8	ball	in	a	corner,	pour	a	cup	of	strong	coffee,	and	run	the	table	again.	Another
rack,	and	I	leave	the	4	ball	an	inch	from	the	pocket.	Thirty-three	in	a	row.	Not	bad.
Vasectomy	reversals?

12.
The	police	follow	me,	but	halfheartedly.	Partner	says	they’re	tailing	me	about
half	the	time,	that	they	got	fired	up	when	Swanger	met	me	in	the	van,	but	that	was
over	a	week	ago.	Partner	drops	me	off	at	Ken’s	Kars,	a	cheap	secondhand	lot	in	the
Hispanic	part	of	town.	I’ve	done	some	work	for	Ken,	kept	him	out	of	jail,	and	he
and	I	both	know	that	our	tag-teaming	days	are	not	over.	He	loves	shady	deals,	the
darker	the	better,	and	it’s	just	a	matter	of	time	before	a	SWAT	team	shows	up	with
another	arrest	warrant.
For	twenty	bucks	cash,	per	day,	Ken	will	“lease”	me	a	serviceable	car	from	his
sad	 inventory,	 no	 questions	 asked.	 I	 do	 this	 occasionally	 when	 I	 think	 I’m	 being
watched.	My	black	Ford	cargo	van	is	quite	easy	to	spot.	The	dented	Subaru	wagon
Ken	 has	 selected	 for	 me,	 however,	 will	 never	 attract	 attention.	 I	 spend	 a	 few
minutes	with	him,	swap	some	insults,	and	hit	the	road.
I	weave	through	a	run-down	part	of	town,	circling	back	here	and	there,	with
one	eye	on	the	mirror.	I	eventually	find	a	bypass	that	takes	me	to	the	interstate,
and	when	I’m	sure	there’s	no	one	following	me,	I	head	south.	Fifty-two	miles	from
the	 city	 limits,	 I	 pass	 Dr.	 Woo’s	 sign	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 road.	 As	 Swanger
said,	it’s	a	large	billboard	at	the	edge	of	a	cornfield.	Next	to	the	words	“Vasectomy
Reversals”	 is	 the	 large	 goofy	 face	 of	 Dr.	 Woo	 as	 he	 looks	 down	 upon	 the
northbound	traffic.	I	turn	around	at	the	next	exit,	drive	four	miles	back	to	the	sign,
and	park	near	it.	Traffic	roars	by,	the	drafts	from	the	big	trucks	almost	lifting	my
little	Subaru.	Next	to	the	shoulder	there	is	a	ditch	covered	with	weeds	and	clogged
with	 litter,	 and	 beyond	 the	 ditch	 there	 is	 a	 chain-link	 fence	 choked	 with	 vines.
Beyond	the	fence	is	a	gravel	frontage	road	that	borders	the	cornfield.	The	farmer
who	 owns	 the	 place	 has	 carved	 out	 a	 narrow	 rectangle	 to	 lease	 to	 the	 sign
company,	and	in	the	center	of	it	there	are	four	large	metal	poles	that	anchor	the
billboard.	 Around	 them	 are	 weeds,	 more	 litter,	 a	 few	 stray	 stalks	 of	 corn.	 Above
them,	Dr.	Woo	grins	at	the	traffic	as	he	hawks	his	skills.
He’s	the	last	guy	I	would	trust	with	my	testicles.
Though	I	have	no	experience,	I	suppose	one	could	use	darkness	as	cover,	ease
along	 the	 frontage	 road,	 dig	 a	 nice	 grave,	 drag	 a	 body	 over	 to	 it,	 refill	 the	 hole,
scatter	 dirt	 and	 litter	 around,	 and	 cover	 it	 all	 up.	 Let	 a	 few	 months	 go	 by	 as	 the
seasons	change	and	the	dirt	settles.
And	why	would	you	pick	a	spot	so	close	to	an	interstate	highway	with	twenty
thousand	 cars	 a	 day?	 I	 have	 no	 idea,	 but	 I	 remind	 myself	 that	 I’m	 trying	 to
understand	the	mind	of	a	very	sick	person.	Hiding	in	the	open	works	all	the	time,	I
guess.	And	I’m	sure	that	at	3:00	a.m.	this	place	is	fairly	deserted.
I	stare	at	the	weeds	under	the	sign	and	think	about	the	Kemp	family.	And	I
curse	the	day	I	met	Arch	Swanger.

13.
Two	days	later,	I’m	waiting	in	a	hallway	in	the	Old	Courthouse	when	I	get	a
text	 from	 Detective	 Reardon.	 He	 says	 we	 need	 to	 talk,	 and	 soon.	 It’s	 urgent.	 An
hour	later,	Partner	drops	me	off	at	Central	and	I	hustle	back	to	Reardon’s	cramped
and	suffocating	office.	No	hellos,	no	handshake,	no	greeting	of	any	kind,	but	then	I
don’t	expect	any.
He	grunts,	“You	got	a	minute?”
“I’m	here,”	I	say.
“Have	 a	 seat.”	 There	 is	 only	 one	 place	 to	 sit—a	 leather	 bench	 covered	 with
dust	and	files.	I	look	at	it	and	say,	“That’s	okay.	I’ll	just	stand.”
“Whatever.	Do	you	know	where	Swanger	is?”
“No,	I	have	no	idea.	Thought	you	guys	were	bird-dogging	him.”
“We	were,	but	he	got	away.	No	sign	for	over	a	week,	nothing.	Vanished.”	He
falls	into	his	wooden	swivel	chair	and	eventually	gets	both	feet	onto	his	desk.	“Are
you	still	his	lawyer?”
“No.	When	he	hired	me	he	paid	with	a	rubber	check.	Our	contract	is	void.”
A	 smirk,	 a	 fake	 smile.	 “Well,	 he	 thinks	 otherwise.	 This	 came	 in	 just	 after
midnight,	right	here	on	my	office	phone.”	He	reaches	over	and	hits	two	buttons	on
his	vintage	answering	machine.	After	the	beep,	Arch’s	voice	begins:	“This	message
is	for	Detective	Landy	Reardon.	This	is	Arch	Swanger	calling.	I’m	on	the	road	and
I’m	not	coming	back.	You	guys	have	hounded	me	for	months	and	I’m	tired	of	it.
My	 poor	 mother	 is	 out	 of	 her	 mind	 because	 of	 your	 constant	 surveillance	 and
abusive	tactics.	Please	leave	her	alone.	She’s	completely	innocent	and	so	am	I.	You
know	 damned	 well	 I	 didn’t	 kill	 that	 girl,	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 it.	 I’d	 like	 to
explain	this	to	someone	who’s	willing	to	listen,	but	if	I	come	back	you’ll	just	bust
my	ass	and	throw	me	in	jail.	I	got	some	good	information,	Reardon,	and	I’d	like	to
talk	to	someone.	I	know	where	she	is	right	now.	How	about	that?”
There	is	a	long	pause.	I	look	at	Reardon	and	he	says,	“Hang	on.”
Arch	 coughs	 a	 couple	 of	 times,	 and	 when	 he	 resumes	 his	 voice	 is	 shaky,	 as
though	 he’s	 getting	 emotional:	 “Only	 three	 people	 know	 where	 she’s	 buried,
Reardon.	Only	three.	Me,	the	guy	who	killed	her,	and	my	lawyer,	Sebastian	Rudd.
I	 told	 Rudd	 because	 as	 a	 lawyer	 he	 can’t	 tell	 anyone.	 Isn’t	 that	 screwed	 up,
Reardon?	Why	should	a	lawyer	be	able	to	keep	such	deadly	secrets?	I	like	Rudd,
don’t	get	me	wrong.	Hell,	I	hired	him.	And	if	by	some	lucky	break	you’re	able	to
find	 me,	 then	 I’ll	 bring	 in	 Rudd	 to	 walk	 me.”	 Another	 pause,	 then,	 “Gotta	 go,
Reardon.	Later.”
I	step	over	to	the	leather	bench	and	sit	on	some	files.	Reardon	turns	off	the

answering	machine	and	leans	forward	on	his	elbows.	“It	came	in	from	a	prepaid
cell	phone	and	we	couldn’t	track	it.	We	have	no	idea	where	he	is.”
I	take	a	deep	breath	as	I	try	to	unscramble	my	thoughts.	There	is	no	strategic
or	commonsense	reason	for	Swanger	to	tell	the	police	that	I	know	where	the	body
is	buried.	Period!	And	the	fact	that	he	was	so	eager	to	tell	me,	and	then	blab	it	to
the	 cops,	 makes	 me	 doubt	 him	 even	 more.	 He’s	 a	 con,	 perhaps	 a	 serial	 killer,	 a
psychopath	who	enjoys	playing	games	and	revels	in	the	lying.	But	whatever	he	is,
and	whatever	his	motives,	he	has	thrown	me	off	a	cliff	and	I’m	free-falling.
The	door	suddenly	opens	and	in	walks	Roy	Kemp,	assistant	chief	of	police	and
father	of	the	missing	girl.	He	closes	the	door	behind	him	and	takes	a	step	toward
me.	He’s	a	tough	guy,	an	ex-Marine	with	a	square	jaw	and	a	grayish	crew	cut.	His
eyes	are	weary	and	red,	evidence	of	the	toll	the	last	year	has	taken.	His	eyes	also
convey	a	hatred	that	makes	my	skin	crawl.	My	collar	is	instantly	wet.
Reardon	gets	to	his	feet,	cracks	his	knuckles	as	if	he’s	about	to	use	his	fists,
and	gives	me	a	look	that	could	kill,	and	probably	will.
It’s	fatal	to	show	weakness	to	a	cop,	or	a	prosecutor	or	judge,	even	a	jury,	but
right	now	it	is	impossible	to	conjure	up	the	slightest	trace	of	confidence,	let	alone
my	usual	cockiness.
Kemp	gets	right	to	the	point	with	“Where	is	she,	Rudd?”
I	 slowly	 get	 to	 my	 feet,	 raise	 both	 hands,	 and	 say,	 “I	 gotta	 think	 about	 this,
okay?	I’m	caught	off	guard	here.	You	guys	had	time	to	plan	this	ambush.	Give	me
some	time,	okay?”
Kemp	says,	“I	don’t	give	a	damn	about	your	confidentiality	and	ethics	and	all
that	 crap,	 Rudd.	 You	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 we’re	 going	 through.	 It’s	 been	 eleven
months	 and	 eighteen	 days	 of	 sheer	 hell.	 My	 wife	 can’t	 get	 out	 of	 bed.	 My	 whole
family	is	falling	apart.	We’re	desperate,	Rudd.”
For	 all	 of	 his	 fearsomeness,	 Roy	 Kemp	 is	 a	 man	 in	 grievous	 pain,	 a	 father
who’s	 sleepwalking	 through	 his	 worst	 nightmare.	 He	 needs	 a	 body,	 a	 funeral,	 a
permanent	 grave	 where	 he	 and	 his	 wife	 can	 kneel	 on	 the	 grass	 and	 properly
mourn.	The	horror	and	uncertainty	must	be	overwhelming.
He’s	blocking	my	narrow	path	to	the	door,	and	I’m	wondering	if	he’ll	actually
get	physical.
I	say,	“Look,	Chief,	you’re	assuming	that	everything	Arch	Swanger	says	is	the
truth,	and	that	could	be	a	bad	assumption.”
“Do	you	know	where	my	daughter	is?”
“I	know	what	Arch	Swanger	said,	but	I	do	not	know	if	he’s	telling	the	truth.
Frankly,	I	doubt	it.”
“Then	tell	us	anyway.	We’ll	go	look.”

“It’s	 not	 that	 simple.	 I	 can’t	 repeat	 what	 he	 said	 to	 me	 in	 confidence,	 you
know	that.”
Kemp	 closes	 his	 eyes.	 I	 glance	 down	 and	 notice	 both	 his	 fists	 are	 clenched.
Slowly,	 he	 relaxes	 them.	 I	 look	 at	 Reardon,	 who’s	 glaring	 at	 me.	 I	 look	 back	 at
Kemp,	 whose	 red	 eyes	 are	 open	 slightly.	 He’s	 nodding,	 as	 if	 he’s	 saying,	 “Okay,
Rudd,	we’ll	play	it	your	way.	But	we’ll	get	you.”
Frankly,	 I’m	 on	 their	 side.	 I	 would	 love	 to	 spill	 my	 guts,	 help	 get	 the	 girl
properly	 laid	 to	 rest,	 help	 track	 down	 Swanger,	 and	 watch	 with	 satisfaction	 as	 a
jury	nails	him	for	murder.	Sadly,	though,	that	is	not	an	option.	I	take	a	small	step
toward	the	door	and	say,	“I’d	like	to	leave	now.”
Kemp	 doesn’t	 move,	 and	 somehow	 I	 manage	 to	 brush	 by	 him	 without
provoking	a	fight.	As	I	grab	the	doorknob	I	can	almost	feel	a	knife	in	my	back,	but
I	survive	and	make	it	to	the	hallway.	I’ve	never	left	Central	in	a	bigger	hurry.

14.
It’s	the	third	Friday	of	the	month,	time	to	see	Judith	for	our	mandatory	twodrink	meeting.	Neither	of	us	wants	it,	but	neither	is	willing	to	surrender	and	quit.
To	 do	 so	 would	 be	 to	 confess	 a	 weakness,	 something	 we	 both	 simply	 cannot	 do,
not	 to	 each	 other	 anyway.	 We	 tell	 ourselves	 that	 we	 need	 to	 keep	 the	 lines	 of
communication	open	because	we	share	a	son.	That	poor	child.
This	 is	 our	 first	 drink	 since	 she	 dragged	 me	 into	 court	 in	 her	 futile	 effort	 to
terminate	 all	 visitation	 rights.	 So,	 with	 that	 little	 brawl	 still	 hanging	 in	 the	 air,
there	 will	 be	 an	 even	 thicker	 layer	 of	 tension.	 Frankly,	 I	 was	 hoping	 she	 would
cancel.	I	could	easily	be	provoked	into	a	tongue-lashing.
I	get	to	the	bar	early	and	find	a	booth.	She	arrives	on	time	as	always,	but	with
a	 pleasant	 look	 on	 her	 face.	 Judith	 is	 not	 a	 pleasant	 person	 and	 doesn’t	 smile
much.	Most	lawyers	battle	stress,	but	most	lawyers	don’t	work	in	a	firm	with	nine
other	 women,	 all	 known	 to	 be	 ball-squeezing	 litigators	 looking	 for	 a	 fight.	 Her
office	is	a	pressure	cooker,	and	I	suspect	her	home	life	is	not	that	much	fun.	The
older	 Starcher	 gets,	 the	 more	 he	 talks	 about	 all	 the	 yelling	 between	 Judith	 and
Ava.	I,	of	course,	pump	the	kid	for	all	the	dirt	I	can	get.
“How	was	your	week?”	I	ask,	the	standard	opening.
“The	same.	Looks	like	you’re	on	a	roll.	Another	picture	in	the	paper.”
The	 waiter	 takes	 our	 orders,	 always	 the	 same:	 chardonnay	 for	 her,	 whiskey
sour	 for	 me.	 Whatever	 pleasant	 thought	 she	 brought	 into	 the	 bar	 has	 now
vanished.
“A	 bit	 premature,”	 I	 say.	 “I	 don’t	 represent	 the	 guy	 anymore.	 He	 couldn’t
handle	the	fee.”
“Gee,	think	of	all	the	publicity	you’ll	miss.”
“I’ll	find	some	more.”
“I	have	no	doubt	about	that.”
“I’m	not	in	the	mood	to	swap	insults.	I	get	Starcher	tomorrow	for	my	thirtysix	hours.	Any	problems	with	that?”
“What	are	your	plans?”
“So	I	have	to	submit	my	plans	to	you	for	approval?	When	did	the	court	order
this?”
“Just	curious,	that’s	all.	You	need	a	drink.”
We	 stare	 at	 the	 table	 for	 a	 few	 minutes,	 waiting	 for	 the	 alcohol.	 When	 it
arrives,	 we	 grab	 the	 glasses.	 After	 the	 third	 gulp,	 I	 say,	 “My	 mother	 is	 in	 town.

We’ll	 take	 Starcher	 to	 the	 mall	 for	 the	 usual	 ritual	 whereby	 the	 noncustodial
parent	kills	a	few	hours	drinking	coffee	while	the	kid	rides	the	carousel	and	bangs
around	the	playground.	Then	we’ll	have	bad	pizza	and	bad	ice	cream	in	the	food
court	and	watch	the	clowns	turn	flips	and	pass	out	balloons.	After	that	we’ll	drive
down	to	the	river	and	take	a	walk	by	the	boats	in	the	harbor.	What	else	would	you
like	to	know?”
“You	plan	to	keep	him	tomorrow	night?”
“I	 get	 thirty-six	 hours,	 once	 a	 month.	 That’s	 9:00	 a.m.	 tomorrow	 until	 9:00
p.m.	Sunday.	Do	the	math.	It’s	not	that	complicated.”
The	 waiter	 pops	 in	 to	 ask	 how	 we’re	 doing.	 I	 order	 another	 round,	 even
though	 our	 glasses	 are	 not	 yet	 half-empty.	 Over	 the	 past	 year,	 I	 have	 almost
managed	to	look	forward	to	these	brief	meetings	with	Judith.	We’re	both	lawyers
and	occasionally	we’ve	found	common	ground.	I	once	loved	her,	though	I’m	not	so
sure	 she	 felt	 the	 same.	 We	 share	 a	 child.	 I	 have	 entertained	 the	 fantasy	 that	 we
could	possibly	develop	a	friendship,	one	that	I	need	because	I	have	so	few	friends.
Right	now,	though,	I	can’t	stand	the	sight	of	her.
We	drink	in	silence,	two	brooding	ex-lovers	who	would	really	like	to	strangle
one	another.	She	breaks	the	tension	with	“What	kind	of	person	is	Arch	Swanger?”
We	 talk	 about	 him	 for	 a	 few	 minutes,	 then	 about	 the	 abduction	 and	 the
nightmare	the	Kemp	family	is	enduring.	A	lawyer	she	knows	once	handled	a	DUI
for	Jiliana’s	last	boyfriend,	which	is	supposed	to	somehow	be	enlightening.
The	drinks	are	finished	in	thirty	minutes,	a	record,	and	we	part	ways	without
even	the	obligatory	peck	on	the	cheek.

15.
It’s	 a	 challenge	 each	 month	 to	 plan	 an	 activity	 that	 keeps	 Starcher
entertained.	 He’s	 already	 told	 me	 he’s	 tired	 of	 the	 mall,	 the	 zoo,	 the	 fire	 station,
miniature	 golf,	 and	 the	 children’s	 theater.	 What	 he	 really	 wants	 to	 do	 is	 watch
more	cage	fighting,	but	that’s	not	going	to	happen.	So,	I	buy	him	a	boat.
We	meet	my	mother	at	a	place	called	the	Landing,	a	contrived	boathouse	in
the	middle	of	City	Park.	She	and	I	drink	coffee	while	Starcher	slurps	his	hot	cocoa.
My	 mother	 is	 worried	 about	 his	 upbringing.	 The	 kid	 has	 no	 table	 manners	 and
never	utters	the	words	“sir,”	“ma’am,”	“please,”	and	“thank	you.”	I’ve	pushed	him
on	this	and	gotten	nowhere.
The	boat	is	a	remote-controlled	model	racer	with	an	engine	that	whines	like	a
muffled	chain	saw.	The	pond	is	a	large	man-made	circle	of	water	with	a	gushing
fountain	 in	 the	 center.	 It’s	 a	 magnet	 for	 model	 boats	 of	 all	 varieties,	 and	 for	 all
ages.	 Starcher	 and	 I	 fiddle	 with	 the	 remote	 controls	 for	 half	 an	 hour	 before
everything	makes	sense.	When	he’s	comfortable,	I	turn	him	loose	and	take	a	seat
next	to	my	mother	on	a	bench	under	a	tree.
It’s	 a	 beautiful	 day,	 with	 crisp	 light	 air	 and	 a	 brilliant	 blue	 sky.	 The	 park	 is
crawling	 with	 people—families	 strolling	 about	 eating	 ice	 cream,	 new	 moms	 with
massive	strollers,	young	lovers	rolling	in	the	leaves.	And	no	shortage	of	divorced
fathers	exercising	their	rights	of	visitation.
My	mother	and	I	chat	about	nothing	of	any	importance	as	we	watch	her	only
grandson	 in	 the	 distance.	 She	 lives	 two	 hours	 away	 and	 does	 not	 get	 our	 local
news.	She’s	heard	nothing	of	the	Swanger	affair	and	I’m	not	about	to	bring	it	up.
She	has	a	lot	of	opinions	and	does	not	approve	my	career.	Her	first	husband,	my
father,	was	a	lawyer	who	made	a	nice	living	in	real	estate.	He	died	when	I	was	ten.
Her	second	husband	made	a	fortune	in	rubber	bullets	and	died	at	the	age	of	sixtytwo.	She’s	been	afraid	to	gamble	on	a	third	one.
I	 fetch	 us	 more	 coffee	 in	 paper	 cups	 and	 we	 resume	 our	 conversation.
Starcher	waves	me	over,	and	when	I	get	there	he	hands	me	the	controls	and	says
he	needs	to	go	pee.	The	restroom	is	not	far	away,	just	on	the	other	side	of	the	pond
in	 a	 building	 that	 houses	 the	 concession	 stands	 and	 park	 offices.	 I	 ask	 him	 if	 he
needs	help	and	he	shoots	me	a	dirty	look.	He	is,	after	all,	now	eight	years	old	and
gaining	confidence.	I	watch	him	as	he	walks	to	the	building	and	enters	the	men’s
restroom.	I	stop	the	boat	and	wait.
There	 is	 a	 sudden	 commotion	 behind	 me,	 loud	 angry	 voices,	 then	 two
gunshots	crack	through	the	air.	People	start	screaming.	About	fifty	yards	away,	a
black	 teenager	 sprints	 across	 the	 park,	 leaps	 over	 a	 bench,	 darts	 between	 some
saplings	and	into	the	woods,	running	as	if	his	life	is	in	danger.	Evidently	it	is.	Not
far	behind	him	is	another	young	black	male,	angrier	and	with	the	gun.	He	fires	it

again,	and	people	hit	the	ground.	All	around	me,	folks	who	were	enjoying	the	day
are	now	ducking,	crawling,	clutching	children,	and	scurrying	for	their	lives.	It’s	a
scene	 from	 television,	 something	 we’ve	 all	 witnessed	 before,	 and	 it	 takes	 a	 few
seconds	to	realize	that	this	is	not	fiction.	That’s	a	real	gun!
I	think	about	Starcher,	but	he’s	on	the	other	side	of	the	pond	in	the	restroom,
a	 good	 distance	 from	 the	 gunfire.	 As	 I	 duck	 and	 look	 wildly	 around,	 a	 man
scampering	away	bumps	into	me,	grunts	“Sorry,”	and	keeps	moving.
When	 both	 the	 prey	 and	 the	 hunter	 are	 lost	 in	 the	 woods,	 I	 wait,	 afraid	 to
move.	Then,	two	more	gunshots	in	the	distance.	If	the	second	guy	found	the	first
guy,	at	least	we	didn’t	have	to	watch	it.	We	pause,	wait,	then	start	to	move	again.
My	heart	is	racing	as	I	stand	and	gawk	at	the	thick	trees	along	with	everyone	else.
When	 it	 appears	 as	 though	 the	 danger	 has	 passed,	 I	 take	 a	 deep	 breath.	 People
stare	at	each	other,	relieved	but	still	stunned.	Did	we	really	just	see	what	we	just
saw?	 Two	 policemen	 on	 bicycles	 fly	 around	 the	 corner	 and	 disappear	 into	 the
woods.	In	the	distance	a	siren	can	be	heard.
I	look	at	my	mother,	who’s	on	the	phone	as	if	she	missed	it	all.	I	look	at	the
men’s	restroom;	Starcher	is	still	inside.	I	start	walking	that	way,	pausing	to	place
the	 remote	 control	 on	 the	 bench	 beside	 my	 mother.	 Several	 men	 and	 boys	 have
come	and	gone	from	the	restroom.
“What	was	that?”	she	asks.
“Life	in	the	big	city,”	I	say	as	I	walk	away.
Starcher	is	not	in	the	restroom.	I	hurry	outside	and	begin	looking	around.	I
grab	 my	 mother,	 tell	 her	 he’s	 disappeared,	 and	 tell	 her	 to	 check	 out	 the	 ladies’
restroom.	For	several	long	minutes	the	two	of	us	scour	the	area,	our	fear	mounting
with	 each	 second.	 He’s	 not	 the	 kind	 of	 kid	 who	 would	 wander	 off.	 No,	 Starcher
would	take	a	pee	and	head	straight	back	to	the	pond	to	continue	his	boat	racing.
My	heart	is	pounding	and	I’m	sweating.
The	two	bicycle	cops	emerge	from	the	woods,	without	a	suspect,	and	head	our
way.	 I	 stop	 them,	 tell	 them	 my	 son	 is	 missing,	 and	 they	 immediately	 get	 on	 the
radio.	In	my	panic,	I	stop	others	and	ask	them	to	help.
Two	 more	 bicycle	 cops	 arrive.	 The	 area	 around	 the	 Landing	 is	 now	 a	 panic
zone;	 everyone	 knows	 a	 kid	 is	 missing.	 The	 police	 are	 trying	 to	 lock	 down	 the
entire	park,	to	keep	anyone	from	leaving,	but	there	are	a	dozen	points	of	entry	and
exit.	 Patrol	 cars	 arrive.	 The	 urgent	 wail	 of	 sirens	 only	 adds	 to	 the	 alarm.	 I	 see	 a
man	in	a	red	sweater.	I	think	I	saw	him	enter	the	men’s	restroom.	He	says	yes,	he
was	there,	and	he	saw	a	kid	at	the	urinal.	Everything	seemed	fine.	No,	he	did	not
see	 the	 kid	 leave.	 I	 jog	 up	 and	 down	 the	 sidewalks	 that	 weave	 through	 the	 park,
asking	everyone	along	the	way	if	they’ve	seen	an	eight-year-old	boy	who	seemed
lost.	He	was	wearing	jeans	and	a	brown	sweatshirt.	No	one	has	seen	him.
As	the	seconds	tick	by,	I	try	to	calm	myself.	He	has	just	wandered	off.	He	has

not	been	abducted.	It	doesn’t	work;	I	am	in	full	panic.
This	is	the	awful	story	you	read	about	but	think	it	can	never	happen	to	you.

16.
After	half	an	hour	my	mother	is	ready	to	collapse.	A	medic	sits	beside	her	on	a
park	bench	and	tends	to	her.	The	police	ask	me	to	stay	with	her	too,	but	I	cannot
sit	still.	There	are	cops	everywhere.	God	bless	them.
A	 young	 man	 in	 a	 dark	 suit	 introduces	 himself	 as	 Lynn	 Colfax.	 He	 is	 the
detective	in	the	Missing	Children	Division,	City	Police.	What	kind	of	sick	society
needs	an	entire	section	of	its	police	department	dedicated	to	missing	children?
He	 and	 I	 walk	 through	 the	 final	 moments.	 I	 stand	 exactly	 where	 I	 was
standing	when	Starcher	left	for	the	restroom,	less	than	a	hundred	feet	away.	I	kept
my	 eyes	 on	 him	 until	 he	 went	 inside,	 then	 I	 was	 jolted	 by	 the	 sound	 of	 gunfire.
Step	by	step,	thought	by	thought,	we	go	through	it	all.
The	men’s	restroom	has	only	one	door	and	no	windows.	It	is	inconceivable	to
me,	 and	 to	 Detective	 Colfax,	 that	 someone	 could	 grab	 an	 eight-year-old	 boy	 and
physically	 remove	 him	 from	 the	 premises	 without	 being	 seen.	 But,	 at	 that
moment,	 most	 of	 the	 people	 hanging	 around	 the	 Landing	 were	 either	 crouching
behind	 benches	 or	 shrubs	 or	 flat	 on	 the	 ground	 as	 the	 bullets	 were	 fired.	 Other
witnesses	 verify	 this.	 We	 estimate	 the	 diversion	 lasted	 fifteen,	 maybe	 twenty
seconds.	Plenty	of	time,	I	guess.
After	an	hour,	I	finally	admit	that	Starcher	has	not	simply	wandered	away.	He
has	been	taken.

17.
The	 best	 way	 to	 tell	 Judith	 is	 to	 make	 her	 see	 for	 herself.	 If	 something	 bad
happens	to	our	son,	she	will	never	forgive	me,	and	she	will	always	maintain	that
since	 I	 am	 such	 a	 lousy	 parent,	 am	 in	 fact	 thoroughly	 derelict	 in	 all	 areas	 of
parental	guidance,	that	his	disappearance	was	and	is	completely	my	fault.	Great,
Judith.	You	win;	I’m	to	blame.
It	might	help	her	to	see	the	crime	scene,	especially	with	all	the	cops	around.
I	stare	at	my	cell	phone	for	a	long	time,	then	make	the	call.	She	answers	with
“What	is	it?”
I	swallow	hard	and	try	to	sound	calm.	“Judith,	Starcher	has	disappeared.	I’m
at	 the	 Landing	 in	 City	 Park,	 with	 his	 grandmother,	 and	 with	 the	 police.	 He
disappeared	about	an	hour	ago.	You	need	to	get	down	here	now.”
She	yells,	“What?”
“You	heard	me.	Starcher	is	missing.	I	think	he’s	been	abducted.”
Again	she	yells,	“What!	How!	Were	you	watching	him?”
“Yes,	as	a	matter	of	fact	I	was.	We’ll	argue	later.	Just	get	down	here.”
Twenty-one	 minutes	 later,	 I	 see	 her	 racing	 along	 the	 sidewalk,	 obviously	 a
woman	who’s	scared	out	of	her	mind.	As	she	approaches	the	Landing	and	sees	all
the	 policemen,	 then	 me,	 then	 the	 yellow	 crime	 scene	 ribbon	 strung	 around	 the
restrooms,	 she	 stops,	 throws	 a	 hand	 over	 her	 mouth,	 and	 breaks	 down.	 Lynn
Colfax	and	I	walk	over	to	her	and	try	to	calm	her.
She	grits	her	teeth	and	says,	“What	happened?”
She	wipes	her	eyes	as	we	go	through	it	again.	And	again.	She	says	nothing	to
me,	as	if	I’m	not	a	part	of	the	drama.	She	won’t	even	look	at	me.	She	grills	Colfax
until	all	questions	have	been	asked.	She	takes	complete	charge	of	the	family’s	side
of	 things,	 even	 informs	 the	 detective	 that	 she	 is	 the	 custodial	 parent	 and	 all
communication	 will	 be	 through	 her.	 Me,	 I’m	 viewed	 as	 nothing	 more	 than	 a
negligent	babysitter.
Judith	 has	 a	 photo	 of	 Starcher	 on	 her	 cell	 phone.	 Colfax	 e-mails	 this	 to	 his
office.	 He	 says	 that	 posters	 will	 go	 up	 immediately.	 All	 alerts	 and	 warnings	 are
already	in	play.	Every	policeman	in	the	City	is	looking	for	Starcher.

18.
We	 eventually	 leave	 the	 Landing,	 though	 it	 is	 painful.	 I	 would	 prefer	 to	 sit
here	 all	 afternoon	 and	 throughout	 the	 night,	 just	 waiting	 for	 my	 little	 boy	 to
appear	 and	 ask,	 “Where’s	 my	 boat?”	 It	 is	 the	 last	 place	 he	 saw	 his	 father.	 If	 he’s
just	 lost,	 then	 maybe	 he’ll	 find	 his	 way	 back.	 We’re	 sleepwalking	 through	 this,
numb	and	stunned	and	telling	ourselves	that	this	is	not	really	happening.
Lynn	Colfax	says	he’s	been	through	this	before,	and	the	best	move	right	now
is	for	us	to	meet	at	Central,	in	his	office,	and	talk	about	how	to	proceed.	It’s	either
an	 abduction,	 a	 disappearance,	 or	 a	 kidnapping,	 and	 all	 three	 pose	 different
problems.
I	 take	 my	 mother	 to	 my	 apartment,	 where	 she	 is	 met	 by	 Partner.	 He’ll	 take
care	of	her	for	a	few	hours.	She’s	blaming	herself	for	not	being	more	attentive,	and
she’s	griping	because	that	bitch	Judith	wouldn’t	even	acknowledge	her	presence.
“Why	 did	 you	 ever	 marry	 that	 woman?”	 she	 asks.	 It	 wasn’t	 by	 choice.	 Really,
Mom?	Can’t	we	discuss	this	later?
Colfax	has	a	neat	desk	and	a	calm,	soothing	presence.	It	means	nothing	to	us
—Judith	 and	 me.	 Ava,	 the	 third	 parent,	 is	 out	 of	 town.	 He	 begins	 by	 telling	 us	 a
story	about	an	abduction,	one	of	the	few	with	a	happy	ending.	Most	end	badly,	and
I	 know	 this.	 I’ve	 read	 the	 summaries.	 With	 each	 passing	 hour,	 the	 chances	 of	 a
good	outcome	get	slimmer	and	slimmer.
He	asks	if	there	is	anyone	that	we	know	of	who	might	be	a	suspect?	A	relative,
a	 neighbor,	 the	 pervert	 down	 the	 street,	 anyone?	 We	 shake	 our	 heads,	 no.	 I’ve
already	 thought	 about	 Link	 Scanlon	 and	 I’m	 not	 ready	 to	 bring	 him	 into	 this.	 A
kidnapping	 does	 not	 fit	 his	 profile.	 All	 he	 wants	 from	 me	 is	 $100,000	 in	 cash,	 a
refund,	 and	 I	 cannot	 believe	 he	 would	 resort	 to	 kidnapping	 my	 son	 for	 ransom.
Link	would	prefer	to	break	my	right	leg	this	week	and	my	left	leg	the	next.
Colfax	 says	 it’s	 useful	 to	 immediately	 promise	 a	 reward	 for	 information.	 He
says	a	good	starting	point	is	$50,000.	Judith,	the	sole	parent,	says,	“I	can	handle
that.”	I	doubt	if	she	could	stroke	a	check	for	that	amount,	but	go,	girl.	“I’ll	split	it,”
I	say,	as	if	we’re	playing	cards.
To	make	an	unbearable	situation	even	worse,	Judith’s	parents	arrive	and	are
escorted	into	the	office.	They	grab	their	daughter	and	all	three	have	a	long	cry.	I
stand	 against	 a	 wall,	 as	 far	 away	 as	 possible.	 They	 do	 not	 acknowledge	 my
presence.	Starcher	lives	with	these	grandparents	about	half	the	time,	so	they	are
very	 attached	 to	 him.	 I	 try	 to	 understand	 their	 grief,	 but	 I	 have	 loathed	 these
people	for	so	long	I	cannot	stand	the	sight	of	them.	When	they	settle	down,	they
ask	what	happened	and	I	tell	them.	Colfax	helps	me	out	with	a	few	facts	here	and
there.	 By	 the	 time	 we	 get	 through	 with	 the	 narrative,	 they	 are	 convinced
everything	was	all	my	fault.	Great—now	we’re	getting	somewhere.

I	 do	 not	 have	 to	 stay	 in	 the	 room.	 I	 excuse	 myself,	 leave	 the	 building,	 and
return	 to	 the	 Landing.	 The	 police	 are	 still	 there,	 loitering	 around	 the	 boathouse,
keeping	 people	 away	 from	 the	 men’s	 restroom.	 I	 speak	 to	 them	 and	 express	 my
gratitude;	 they	 are	 sympathetic.	 Partner	 arrives,	 says	 my	 mother	 has	 had	 two
martinis	and	is	somewhat	subdued.	He	and	I	split	up	and	roam	the	walkways	of
the	park.	The	sun	is	setting;	the	shadows	are	getting	longer.	Partner	brings	me	a
flashlight,	and	we	continue	our	search	well	into	the	night.
At	8:00	p.m.	I	call	Judith	to	see	how	she’s	holding	up.	She’s	at	home,	with	her
parents,	waiting	by	the	phone.	I	offer	to	come	over	and	sit,	but	she	says	no	thanks.
She	has	friends	over	and	I	wouldn’t	fit.	I’m	sure	she’s	right	about	that.
I	roam	through	the	park	for	hours,	shining	my	light	at	every	bridge,	culvert,
tree,	and	pile	of	rocks.	This	is	the	worst	day	of	my	life,	and	when	it	ends,	I	sit	on	a
bench	at	midnight	and	finally	weep.

19.
Aided	 by	 whiskey	 and	 a	 pill,	 I	 manage	 to	 sleep	 for	 three	 hours	 on	 the	 sofa
before	 waking	 in	 a	 pool	 of	 sweat.	 Wide	 awake	 now,	 and	 the	 nightmare	 only
continues.	I	shower	to	kill	time	and	check	on	my	mother.	She’s	had	some	pills	and
seems	to	be	in	a	coma.	At	dawn	Partner	and	I	return	to	the	park.	There’s	nowhere
else	 to	 go,	 really.	 What	 else	 am	 I	 supposed	 to	 do?	 Sit	 by	 the	 phone?	 It’s	 in	 my
pocket	and	it	buzzes	at	7:03.	Lynn	Colfax	checks	in	to	see	how	I’m	doing.	I	tell	him
I’m	at	the	park,	still	searching.	He	says	they’ve	had	a	few	tips	but	nothing	useful.
Just	 some	 crackpots	 interested	 in	 the	 reward	 money.	 He	 asks	 if	 I’ve	 seen	 the
Sunday	morning	newspaper.	Yes,	I	have.	Front	page.
Partner	 brings	 some	 muffins	 and	 coffee,	 and	 we	 eat	 on	 a	 picnic	 table
overlooking	 a	 pond	 that’s	 used	 for	 skating	 in	 the	 winter.	 He	 asks,	 “Have	 you
thought	about	Link?”
“Yes,	I	have,	but	I	don’t	think	it’s	him.”
“Why	not?”
“Not	his	kind	of	crime.”
“You’re	probably	right.”
We	 return	 to	 the	 silence	 that	 defines	 our	 relationship,	 a	 quiet	 I	 have	 always
appreciated.	Now,	though,	I	need	someone	to	talk	to.	We	finish	eating	and	split	up
again.	 I	 cover	 the	 same	 paths	 and	 trails,	 look	 under	 the	 same	 footbridges,	 walk
along	the	same	creeks.	I	call	Judith	mid-morning,	and	her	mother	answers	her	cell
phone.	Judith	is	resting,	and,	no,	they’ve	heard	nothing.	Back	at	the	Landing,	the
police	 have	 removed	 the	 crime	 scene	 tape	 and	 things	 have	 returned	 to	 normal.
The	 place	 is	 bustling	 with	 people	 again,	 all	 apparently	 oblivious	 to	 yesterday’s
horror.	I	watch	some	boys	race	their	boats	around	the	pond.	I	stand	where	I	stood
yesterday	when	I	saw	Starcher	for	the	last	time.	A	dull	pain	rips	through	my	gut
and	I’m	forced	to	walk	away.
At	the	rate	I’m	going,	Starcher	is	the	only	child	I’ll	ever	produce.	He	was	an
accident,	 an	 unwanted	 child	 born	 in	 the	 midst	 of	 a	 raging	 war	 between	 his
parents,	but	in	spite	of	that	he	has	blossomed	into	a	beautiful	boy.	I	haven’t	been
much	of	a	father,	but	then	I’ve	been	shut	out	of	his	life.	I	never	dreamed	I	could
miss	 another	 human	 so	 much.	 But	 then,	 what	 parent	 can	 imagine	 a	 child	 being
abducted?
Hours	pass	as	I	roam	the	park.	I	jump	out	of	my	skin	when	my	phone	rings,
but	it’s	only	an	acquaintance	wanting	to	help.	Late	in	the	day,	I	sit	on	a	park	bench
near	a	jogging	trail.	From	out	of	nowhere,	Detective	Landy	Reardon	appears	and
sits	beside	me.	He’s	wearing	a	suit	under	the	standard	black	trench	coat.

“What	brings	you	here?”	I	ask,	startled.
“I’m	just	the	messenger,	Rudd.	Nothing	more.	Not	involved,	really.	But	your
kid	is	okay.”
I	take	a	deep	breath	and	lean	forward,	elbows	on	knees,	thoroughly	confused.
I	manage	to	grunt,	“What?”
He	stares	straight	ahead	as	if	I’m	not	here.	“Your	kid’s	okay.	What	they	want
is	an	exchange.”
“An	exchange?”
“You	got	it.	You	tell	me;	I	tell	them.	You	tell	me	where	the	girl	is	buried,	you
get	your	kid	back	after	they	find	her.”
I	 don’t	 know	 what	 to	 think	 or	 say.	 Praise	 God	 my	 kid	 is	 safe,	 but	 he’s	 safe
because	 the	 cops	 have	 snatched	 him	 and	 are	 holding	 him	 as	 bait!	 I	 tell	 myself	 I
should	be	angry,	furious,	volcanic,	but	I	am	nothing	but	relieved.	Starcher	is	okay!
“They?	Them?	You’re	talking	about	some	of	your	own	people,	right?”
“Sort	of.	Look,	Rudd,	you	gotta	understand	that	Roy	Kemp	has	pretty	much
checked	 out.	 They’ve	 put	 him	 on	 administrative	 leave	 for	 a	 month	 or	 so,	 but	 no
one	knows	it.	He’s	a	mess,	and	he’s	out	there	acting	on	his	own.”
“But	he	has	a	lot	of	friends,	right?”
“Oh	yes.	Kemp	is	highly	regarded.	He’s	a	thirty-year	man,	you	know,	with	a
lot	of	contacts,	a	lot	of	pull.”
“So	this	is	an	inside	job.	I	don’t	believe	it.	And	they’ve	sent	you	to	negotiate.”
“I	 don’t	 know	 where	 the	 kid	 is,	 I	 swear.	 And	 I	 don’t	 like	 being	 where	 I	 am
right	now.”
“That	 makes	 at	 least	 two	 of	 us.	 I	 guess	 I	 shouldn’t	 be	 surprised.	 In	 fact,	 I
should’ve	known	the	cops	were	not	above	snatching	kids.”
“Back	off,	Rudd.	You	got	a	big	mouth,	you	know	that?	Deal	or	no	deal?”
“I’m	 supposed	 to	 tell	 you	 what	 Arch	 Swanger	 told	 me	 about	 the	 girl,	 right?
Where	she’s	buried.	And	let’s	say	Swanger	is	telling	the	truth,	you	find	the	body,
he	 gets	 busted	 for	 capital	 murder,	 and	 my	 career	 as	 a	 lawyer	 is	 over.	 My	 son	 is
returned	safely	to	his	mother,	and	I	get	to	spend	a	lot	more	time	with	him.	In	fact,
I’ll	be	a	full-time	dad.”
“You’re	on	the	right	track.”
“And	if	I	say	no,	what	will	happen	to	my	kid?	Am	I	supposed	to	believe	that	an
assistant	chief	of	police	and	his	thugs	will	actually	hurt	a	child	as	revenge?”
“I	guess	you	gotta	roll	the	dice,	Rudd.”

PART	FIVE

U-HAUL	LAW

1.
I	 fight	 the	 panic.	 I	 tell	 myself	 my	 son	 is	 safe,	 and	 I	 believe	 this.	 But	 the
situation	is	so	urgent	that	it	is	impossible	to	think	rationally.	Partner	and	I	go	to	a
coffee	joint	where	we	huddle	in	a	corner.	I	walk	through	the	various	scenarios	as
he	listens.
There	 is	 really	 no	 choice.	 The	 only	 important	 thing	 here	 is	 the	 safety	 and
deliverance	of	my	son;	everything	else	fades	in	comparison.	If	I	divulge	the	secret
and	 lose	 my	 license	 to	 practice	 law,	 I’ll	 survive.	 Hell,	 I	 might	 even	 prosper
somewhere	 else,	 and	 I	 certainly	 won’t	 be	 dealing	 with	 the	 likes	 of	 Arch	 Swanger
again.	This	could	be	my	ticket	out	of	the	profession,	my	one	beautiful	opportunity
to	walk	away	from	the	law	and	to	search	for	real	happiness.
I	want	that	little	boy	in	my	arms.
Partner	and	I	debate	whether	I	should	call	Judith	and	bring	her	up	to	date.	I
decide	not	to,	not	now	anyway.	She	will	add	nothing	but	stress	and	complications.
And,	much	more	important,	she	might	let	it	slip	to	someone	else	that	Kemp	and
associates	have	pulled	an	inside	job.	Reardon	warned	me	to	keep	it	quiet.
I	 call	 Judith	 anyway,	 just	 to	 check	 on	 her.	 Ava	 answers	 the	 phone	 and	 says
Judith	is	in	bed,	medicated,	and	not	doing	well.	The	FBI	just	left	the	house.	There
is	a	swarm	of	reporters	out	in	the	street.	Things	are	just	awful.	As	if	I	don’t	know.
At	7:00	p.m.	Sunday,	I	call	Reardon	and	say	we	have	a	deal.
It	takes	an	hour	to	get	a	search	warrant.	Obviously,	the	police	have	a	friendly
judge	on	standby.	At	8:30,	Partner	and	I	leave	the	City,	with	one	unmarked	car	in
front	 of	 us	 and	 one	 behind,	 which	 is	 nothing	 unusual.	 By	 the	 time	 we	 get	 to	 Dr.
Woo’s	 sign,	 the	 police	 are	 there	 in	 force.	 Spotlights,	 two	 backhoes,	 at	 least	 two
dozen	men	with	shovels	and	sticks,	and	a	canine	squad	of	dogs	in	crates.	I’ve	told
them	 everything	 I	 know,	 and	 they’re	 examining	 the	 ground	 next	 to	 the	 rows	 of
corn.	 State	 troopers	 guard	 the	 shoulder	 of	 the	 interstate,	 waving	 off	 any	 driver
who	might	get	curious.
Partner	parks	the	van	where	they	tell	us	to	park,	a	hundred	feet	away	from	the
sign	and	the	action.	We	sit	and	watch	and	hope	as	the	first	few	frantic	moments
slip	away	and	the	long	hours	begin.	They	methodically	poke	into	every	square	inch
of	soil.	They	make	a	grid,	comb	through	it,	then	make	another	one.	The	backhoes
are	not	used.	The	dogs	stay	calm.
On	the	other	side	of	the	sign	there	are	several	unmarked	black	cars	bunched
together	in	the	darkness.	I’m	sure	Assistant	Chief	Kemp	is	waiting	in	one	of	them.
I	loathe	him	and	would	like	to	personally	drill	him	between	the	eyes,	but	right	now
he’s	the	man	who	can	deliver	my	son.

And	 then	 I	 remember	 what	 he’s	 been	 through:	 the	 horror,	 the	 fear,	 the
waiting,	the	final	resignation	when	he	and	his	wife	realized	Jiliana	was	not	coming
home.	 Now	 he’s	 sitting	 over	 there	 praying	 his	 men	 will	 find	 some	 bones,
something	for	him	to	bury	properly.	That’s	the	best	he	can	expect—a	skeleton.	My
expectations	are	far	greater	and	certainly	more	realistic.
By	midnight,	I’m	cursing	Arch	Swanger.

2.
As	they	work	through	the	night,	Partner	and	I	take	turns	nodding	off.	We’re
starving	and	desperate	for	coffee,	but	we’re	not	about	to	leave.	At	5:20,	Reardon
calls	my	cell	and	says,	“It’s	a	dry	run,	Rudd,	there’s	nothing	here.”
“I’ve	told	you	everything	I	know,	I	swear.”
“I	believe	you.”
“Thank	you.”
“You	 can	 leave	 now.	 Get	 back	 on	 the	 interstate,	 head	 south	 to	 the	 Four
Corners	exit.	I’ll	call	you	back	in	twenty	minutes.”
As	we	pull	away,	the	searchers	are	packing	up	their	gear.	The	dogs	are	still	in
their	 crates,	 resting.	 Arch	 Swanger	 is	 probably	 watching	 and	 laughing.	 We	 head
south,	 and	 twenty	 minutes	 later	 Reardon	 calls	 again.	 He	 says,	 “You	 know	 that
truck	stop	at	Four	Corners?”
“I	think	so.”
“Park	at	the	gas	pumps	but	don’t	buy	any	gas.	Walk	inside,	the	restaurant	is
on	the	right,	and	at	the	far	end,	away	from	the	counter,	is	a	row	of	booths.	Your
kid	will	be	there	eating	ice	cream.”
“Got	 it.”	 I	 want	 so	 badly	 to	 say	 something	 as	 stupid	 as	 “Thanks,”	 like	 I	 owe
someone	a	debt	of	gratitude	for	kidnapping	my	child,	not	hurting	him,	and	then
giving	 him	 back.	 Truthfully,	 though,	 I	 am	 overcome	 with	 relief,	 joy,	 gratitude,
anticipation,	and	a	strange	disbelief	that	this	abduction	just	might	end	on	a	happy
note.	This	never	happens.
A	 minute	 later,	 my	 phone	 buzzes	 again.	 It’s	 Reardon	 and	 he	 says,	 “Look,
Rudd,	 there’s	 nothing	 to	 be	 gained	 by	 pursuing	 this	 matter,	 asking	 a	 bunch	 of
questions,	running	to	the	press,	chasing	cameras,	you	know,	your	typical	routine.
We’ll	take	care	of	the	press	and	leak	it	that	you	pulled	off	a	dramatic	rescue,	after
an	 anonymous	 phone	 call.	 Our	 kidnapping	 investigation	 will	 continue	 but	 will
turn	up	nothing.	Are	we	on	the	same	page	here,	Rudd?”
“Yes,	I’m	with	you.”	I’ll	agree	to	anything	at	this	point.
“The	 story	 is	 that	 someone	 snatched	 your	 kid,	 got	 fed	 up	 with	 the	 brat
because	he	probably	acts	a	lot	like	you,	and	decided	to	ditch	him	at	a	truck	stop.
You	got	the	story,	Rudd?”
“Got	 it,”	 I	 manage	 to	 spit	 out	 as	 I	 bite	 my	 tongue	 to	 keep	 from	 unloading
every	vile	word	in	the	book.
The	 truck	 stop	 is	 awash	 with	 lights	 and	 crowded	 with	 rigs	 stacked	 in	 neat
rows.	We	park	by	the	pumps	and	I	walk	quickly	inside.	Partner	stays	in	the	van	to

watch	 for	 anyone	 who	 might	 be	 watching	 us.	 The	 restaurant	 is	 busy	 with	 the
breakfast	 crowd.	 The	 smell	 of	 thick	 grease	 hangs	 in	 the	 air.	 The	 counter	 is	 lined
with	 beefy	 truckers	 devouring	 pancakes	 and	 sausages.	 I	 turn	 a	 corner,	 see	 the
booths,	 pass	 one,	 two,	 three,	 and	 there	 in	 the	 fourth	 booth,	 all	 alone,	 is	 little
Starcher	Whitly,	grinning	from	behind	a	large	bowl	of	chocolate	ice	cream.
I	 kiss	 him	 on	 top	 of	 his	 head,	 tousle	 his	 hair,	 and	 sit	 across	 from	 him.	 “Are
you	okay?”	I	ask.
He	shrugs	and	says,	“Sure,	I	guess.”
“Did	anyone	hurt	you?”
He	shakes	his	head.	No.
“Tell	me,	Starcher.	Did	anyone	do	anything	to	hurt	you?”
“No.	They	were	very	nice.”
“And	 who	 is	 they?	 Who	 has	 been	 with	 you	 since	 you	 left	 the	 park	 on
Saturday?”
“Nancy	and	Joe.”
A	waitress	stops	at	the	booth.	I	order	some	coffee	and	scrambled	eggs.	I	ask
her,	“Who	brought	this	kid	in	here?”
The	waitress	looks	around,	says,	“I	don’t	know.	Some	woman	was	here	just	a
minute	 ago,	 said	 the	 kid	 wanted	 a	 bowl	 of	 ice	 cream.	 She	 must’ve	 left	 or
something.	I	guess	you’re	paying	for	the	ice	cream.”
“Gladly.	Do	you	have	surveillance	cameras?”
She	nods	at	the	window.	“Out	there,	but	not	in	here.	Something	the	matter?”
“No.	Thanks.”
As	soon	as	she	leaves	I	ask	Starcher,	“Who	brought	you	in	here?”
“Nancy.”	He	takes	a	bite	of	ice	cream.
“Look,	Starcher,	I	want	you	to	put	the	spoon	down	for	a	moment,	and	I	want
you	to	tell	me	what	happened	when	you	went	into	the	restroom	at	the	park.	You
were	racing	your	boat,	you	had	to	pee,	and	you	walked	to	the	restroom.	Now,	tell
me	what	happened.”
He	slowly	sticks	the	spoon	into	the	ice	cream	and	leaves	it	there.	“Well,	all	of	a
sudden,	this	big	man	grabbed	me.	I	thought	he	was	a	policeman	because	he	was
wearing	a	uniform.”
“Did	he	have	a	gun?”
“I	 don’t	 think	 so.	 He	 put	 me	 in	 a	 truck	 that	 was	 right	 behind	 the	 restroom.
There	was	another	man	driving	the	truck	and	they	drove	away	real	fast.	They	said
they	were	taking	me	to	the	hospital	because	something	bad	had	happened	to	my

grandmother.	They	said	you	would	be	at	the	hospital.	So	we	drove	and	drove	and
then	we	were	out	of	the	City,	way	out	in	the	country,	and	that’s	where	they	left	me
with	Nancy	and	Joe.	The	men	left,	and	Nancy	said	my	grandmother	was	going	to
be	okay,	and	that	you	would	stop	by	real	soon	to	get	me.”
“Okay.	That	was	Saturday	morning.	What	did	you	do	the	rest	of	Saturday,	and
all	day	yesterday,	Sunday?”
“Well,	 we	 watched	 television,	 some	 old	 movies	 and	 stuff,	 and	 we	 played
backgammon	a	lot.”
“Backgammon?”
“Uh-huh.	Nancy	asked	me	what	games	I	liked	to	play	and	I	said	backgammon.
They	didn’t	know	what	it	was,	so	Joe	went	to	the	store	and	bought	a	backgammon
board,	a	cheap	one.	I	taught	them	how	to	play,	and	beat	them	too.”
“So	they	were	nice	to	you?”
“Real	nice.	They	kept	telling	me	you	were	at	the	hospital	and	couldn’t	leave.”
Partner	finally	comes	inside.	He	is	relieved	to	see	Starcher	and	gives	the	kid	a
pat	 on	 the	 head.	 I	 tell	 him	 to	 find	 the	 manager	 of	 the	 truck	 stop	 and	 locate	 the
surveillance	 cameras;	 inform	 the	 manager	 that	 the	 FBI	 will	 want	 the	 footage,	 so
take	care	of	it.
My	 eggs	 arrive	 and	 I	 ask	 Starcher	 if	 he’s	 hungry.	 No,	 he’s	 not.	 He’s	 been
eating	pizza	and	ice	cream	for	the	past	two	days.	Anything	he	wanted.

3.
Since	I’ve	never	been	invited	into	Starcher’s	home,	I	decide	that	I	will	not	take
him	 there.	 I	 don’t	 want	 the	 drama	 and	 theatrics.	 Half	 an	 hour	 from	 the	 City,	 I
finally	call	Judith	with	the	news	that	her	son	is	safe.	He’s	sitting	on	my	lap	as	we
ride	 up	 the	 interstate.	 She	 is	 almost	 too	 stunned	 to	 speak,	 so	 I	 give	 Starcher	 my
phone.	He	says,	“Hi,	Mom,”	and	I	think	she	has	a	complete	meltdown.	I	give	them
a	 few	 minutes,	 then	 take	 the	 phone	 back	 and	 explain	 that	 I	 got	 a	 call	 and	 was
instructed	 to	 pick	 him	 up	 at	 the	 truck	 stop.	 No,	 he	 had	 not	 been	 harmed	 in	 any
way,	except	maybe	too	much	sugar.
The	parking	lot	outside	her	office	is	still	empty—it’s	only	7:30—and	we	wait	in
peace	before	the	storm.	The	black	Jaguar	slides	into	the	lot	and	brakes	hard	next
to	the	van.	I	step	out	with	Starcher	as	Judith	gets	out	and	lunges	for	the	kid.	She
grabs	him,	bawling	and	clawing,	and	right	behind	are	her	parents	and	Ava.	They
take	 turns	 squeezing	 the	 kid;	 everybody’s	 crying.	 I	 can’t	 stand	 these	 people,	 so	 I
walk	over	to	Starcher,	tousle	his	hair	again,	and	say,	“I’ll	see	you	later,	bud.”
He’s	 being	 smothered	 and	 doesn’t	 respond.	 I	 ask	 Judith	 to	 step	 aside	 for	 a
moment,	and	when	we’re	alone	I	say,	“Can	we	meet	here	with	the	FBI	later	in	the
morning?	There’s	more	to	the	story.”
“Tell	me	now,”	she	hisses.
“I’ll	tell	you	when	I	want	to	tell	you,	and	that’s	with	the	FBI	listening.	Okay?”
She	hates	it	when	she’s	not	in	control.	She	takes	a	deep	breath,	grits	her	teeth,
and	manages	to	say,	“Sure.”
I	 walk	 away,	 refuse	 to	 acknowledge	 her	 parents,	 and	 get	 in	 the	 van.	 As	 we
drive	away,	I	look	at	Starcher	and	wonder	when	I’ll	see	him	again.

4.
At	9:00	a.m.,	I’m	in	court	for	a	preliminary	hearing.	By	then,	the	news	is	out,
courtesy	of	a	leak	by	the	police,	that	my	son	has	been	found	and	returned	to	his
parents.	 The	 judge	 grants	 me	 a	 continuance	 and	 I	 hurry	 out	 of	 the	 courtroom.	 I
have	 a	 handful	 of	 lawyer	 pals	 and	 several	 of	 them	 want	 to	 chat	 and	 offer
congratulations.	I’m	just	not	in	the	mood.
Fango	 ambushes	 me	 in	 the	 hallway,	 just	 like	 he	 did	 three	 weeks	 ago.	 I	 keep
walking	and	refuse	to	look	at	him.	He	falls	in	beside	me	and	says,	“Say,	Rudd,	Link
is	getting	pretty	anxious	about	the	money.	I	told	him	about	your	kid	and	all,	and,
by	the	way,	he	sends	his	concerns.”
“Tell	 Link	 to	 worry	 about	 his	 own	 problems,”	 I	 snap	 as	 we	 march	 stride	 for
stride.
“He	is,	and	one	of	his	problems	just	happens	to	be	you	and	the	money.”
“Too	bad,”	I	say	and	walk	even	faster.
He	labors	to	keep	up	with	me,	labors	to	think	of	something	clever	to	say,	and
makes	a	big	mistake	with	“You	know,	your	kid	just	might	not	be	that	safe	after	all.”
I	wheel	around	and	throw	a	tight	right	cross	that	lands	perfectly	on	his	chin.
He	walks	into	it	and	doesn’t	see	it	until	it’s	too	late.	His	head	jerks	so	violently	that
I	hear	the	crunching	of	bones	somewhere,	and	in	the	first	split	second	I	think	I’ve
broken	his	neck.
But	his	neck	is	fine;	he’s	been	hit	before,	plenty	of	times,	and	has	the	scars	to
prove	it.
Fango	sprawls	across	the	marble	floor,	and	when	he	finally	comes	to	rest	he
doesn’t	move.	Out	cold.	A	perfect	knockout	punch	that	I	could	never	replicate.	I’m
tempted	 to	 kick	 him	 in	 the	 head	 a	 few	 times	 for	 good	 measure,	 but	 out	 of	 the
corner	 of	 my	 eye	 I	 see	 a	 sudden	 movement.	 Another	 thug	 is	 moving	 toward	 me
and	he’s	reaching	for	a	pocket	and	a	weapon.	Someone	yells	behind	me.
The	second	thug	goes	down	as	hard	as	Fango	when	Partner	whacks	him	over
the	 head	 with	 a	 stainless	 steel	 baton	 he	 carries	 in	 his	 coat	 pocket.	 The	 baton	 is
designed	for	just	such	occasions.	When	contracted	it’s	about	six	inches	long,	but
when	whipped	out	properly	it	extends	to	eighteen	inches	and	is	equipped	with	a
steel	knob	at	its	tip.	It	can	easily	crack	a	skull,	is	in	fact	designed	to	do	so.	I	tell
Partner	to	give	it	to	me	and	disappear.	A	security	guard	runs	over	and	looks	at	the
two	unconscious	thugs.	I	hand	him	my	bar	association	ID	card	and	say,	“Sebastian
Rudd,	Attorney-at-Law.	These	two	goons	just	tried	to	jump	me.”
A	crowd	gathers.	Fango	wakes	up	first,	mumbling	and	rubbing	his	jaw,	then
he	tries	to	stand	but	can’t	find	his	feet.	Finally,	with	the	help	of	the	security	guard,

he	gets	up,	still	wobbly,	and	wants	to	leave.	A	cop	makes	him	sit	on	a	nearby	bench
while	 an	 EMT	 tends	 to	 his	 buddy.	 Eventually,	 the	 second	 guy	 wakes	 up,	 with	 a
very	large	knot	on	the	back	of	his	head.	They	ice	it	for	a	few	minutes,	then	put	him
on	the	same	bench	with	Fango.	I	stand	close	and	glare	at	them.	They	glare	right
back.	The	EMT	gives	me	an	ice	pack	for	my	right	hand.
Getting	 punched	 is	 nothing	 for	 these	 two	 and	 they’re	 not	 about	 to	 press
charges.	That	would	require	paperwork,	a	lot	of	questions,	and	no	small	amount	of
prying	by	the	police.	They	work	for	Link	Scanlon	and	they	don’t	answer	questions.
Right	now	they	can’t	wait	to	get	out	of	the	building	and	back	on	the	streets,	where
they	make	the	rules.
I	tell	the	police	that	I,	too,	have	no	desire	to	press	charges.	As	I	walk	away,	I
lean	 close	 to	 Fango	 and	 whisper,	 “Tell	 Link	 that	 if	 I	 hear	 one	 more	 word	 out	 of
you,	or	him,	I’m	going	to	the	FBI.”
Fango	sneers	as	if	he	might	spit	in	my	face.

5.
I	suppose	some	days	are	meant	to	be	spent	with	the	FBI.	I	walk	into	the	lobby
of	 Judith’s	 firm	 a	 few	 minutes	 after	 11:00	 a.m.	 The	 receptionist	 is	 smiling	 and
chatting	with	a	paralegal.	They	smile	at	me	and	gush	with	congratulations.	I	don’t
realize	 it	 immediately,	 but	 they	 think	 I’m	 some	 sort	 of	 hero.	 A	 lawyer	 sticks	 her
head	out	of	her	office	door	and	says	congratulations.	The	mood	is	almost	jubilant,
and	why	not?	Starcher	has	been	rescued	and	is	safely	at	home,	where	he	belongs.
We	 were	 all	 numb,	 shell-shocked,	 terrified,	 and	 waiting	 for	 the	 nightmare	 to
become	a	tragedy.	Instead,	we	got	lucky.
Judith	 is	 in	 a	 large,	 well-appointed	 conference	 room	 with	 two	 FBI	 agents,
Beatty	and	Agnew.	Though	my	right	hand	is	swollen	and	throbbing,	I	manage	to
shake	their	hands	without	any	evidence	of	pain.	I	nod	at	Judith,	say	no	to	coffee,
and	ask	how	Starcher	is	doing.	Just	fine.	Everything	is	swell.
Beatty,	the	talker,	explains	that	Judith	called	the	FBI	late	Saturday	afternoon,
but	 they	 had	 not	 officially	 entered	 the	 investigation.	 Agnew,	 the	 note	 taker,
scribbles	 away	 and	 nods	 his	 head;	 whatever	 Beatty	 says	 is	 exactly	 true.	 The	 FBI
does	not	get	involved	in	kidnappings	until	the	local	police	invite	them	in,	or	there
is	evidence	that	the	victim	has	been	moved	across	state	lines.	He	prattles	on	for	a
while,	smug	with	his	importance.	I	let	him	go.
“Now,”	Beatty	says,	looking	at	me,	“you	wanted	to	meet?”
“Yes,”	I	reply.	“I	know	exactly	who	kidnapped	Starcher,	and	I	know	why.”
Agnew’s	 pen	 stops	 in	 mid-stroke	 as	 everyone	 freezes.	 With	 her	 eyebrows
arched,	Judith	says,	“Do	tell.”
So	I	tell	the	story,	all	of	it.

6.
The	elation	Judith	felt	upon	our	son’s	return	dissipates	halfway	through	my
narrative.	 When	 it	 becomes	 apparent	 that	 the	 abduction	 was	 a	 direct	 result	 of
another	one	of	my	notorious	cases,	her	body	language	shifts	dramatically	and	her
mind	 starts	 racing	 away.	 Now,	 finally,	 she	 has	 clear	 proof	 that	 I	 am	 a	 danger	 to
Starcher.	She’ll	probably	file	papers	this	afternoon.
I	 avoid	 eye	 contact	 with	 her,	 but	 the	 vibes	 are	 strong	 enough	 to	 spike	 the
tension	in	the	room.
When	 I	 finish,	 Beatty	 seems	 stunned.	 Agnew	 has	 burned	 through	 an	 entire
legal	pad	with	his	chicken	scratch.
Beatty	 says,	 “Well,	 I	 guess	 there’s	 a	 good	 reason	 the	 police	 didn’t	 want	 us
involved.”
Agnew	grunts	his	agreement.	Judith	asks,	“How	can	you	prove	any	of	this?”
“I	didn’t	say	I	could	prove	it.	Proof	will	be	difficult,	if	not	impossible.	There
may	be	surveillance	footage	of	Nancy	at	the	truck	stop,	taking	the	kid	in,	but	I	bet
she’s	 disguised	 in	 some	 way.	 I	 doubt	 if	 Starcher	 could	 identify	 the	 guy	 who
grabbed	him	at	the	park.	I	don’t	know.	You	have	any	suggestions?”
She	says,	“It	seems	pretty	far-fetched,	the	theory	that	the	police	would	abduct
a	child.”
“So	you	don’t	believe	me?”	I	fire	back.
The	 truth	 is	 that	 she	 wants	 to	 believe	 me.	 She	 wants	 my	 story	 to	 be	 true;
because	 then	 she	 can	 use	 it	 as	 evidence	 against	 me	 when	 she	 drags	 me	 back	 to
court.	She	won’t	answer	my	question.	“So	what’s	next?”	I	ask	Beatty.
“Wow.	I’m	not	sure.	We’ll	have	a	chat	with	our	supervisor	and	go	from	there.”
I	 say,	 “I	 have	 a	 meeting	 this	 afternoon	 with	 an	 investigator	 with	 the	 police.
They’ll	seem	concerned,	ask	a	lot	of	questions,	but	it’s	going	nowhere.	They’ll	close
the	case	by	the	end	of	the	week	and	be	happy	with	a	good	outcome.”
Beatty	asks,	“And	you	want	us	to	open	an	investigation?”
I	look	at	Judith	and	say,	“Perhaps	we	should	talk	about	it	first.	I’m	inclined	to
pursue	Kemp.	What	about	you?”
She	says,	“Let’s	talk.”
Beatty	 and	 Agnew	 take	 their	 cue	 and	 stand	 to	 leave.	 We	 thank	 them	 and
Judith	 walks	 them	 to	 the	 front	 door.	 When	 she	 returns	 to	 the	 conference	 room,
she	 sits	 across	 from	 me	 and	 says,	 “I	 don’t	 know	 what	 to	 do.	 I’m	 not	 thinking
clearly	right	now.”

“We	can’t	allow	the	police	to	do	this,	Judith.”
“I	 know,	 but	 don’t	 you	 already	 have	 enough	 trouble	 with	 them?	 If	 Kemp	 is
desperate	enough	to	snatch	a	child,	he	might	do	anything.	Now	do	you	understand
why	I	get	nervous	when	Starcher	is	with	you?”
I	can’t	really	argue	with	this.
“Do	you	think	Swanger	killed	the	girl?”	she	asks.
“Yes,	and	he’s	probably	killed	others.”
“Great.	 Another	 lunatic	 out	 there	 gunning	 for	 you.	 You’re	 a	 train	 wreck,
Sebastian,	and	you’re	going	to	get	someone	hurt.	I	just	hope	it’s	not	my	child.	We
got	lucky	today,	but	maybe	not	tomorrow.”
There’s	a	knock	on	the	door	and	Judith	says,	“Come	in.”	The	receptionist	tells
her	 there	 is	 a	 reporter	 with	 a	 cameraman	 out	 front.	 Two	 more	 have	 called	 the
office.	“Get	rid	of	them,”	she	says,	glaring	at	me.	What	a	mess	I’ve	created.
We	finally	agree	to	do	nothing	for	a	few	hours.	I’ll	cancel	the	meeting	with	the
police	detective;	the	investigation	is	a	sham	anyway.	As	I	leave	I	tell	her	I’m	sorry,
but	she	wants	no	part	of	an	apology.
I	sneak	out	a	rear	door.

7.
Reporters	 are	 looking	 for	 me,	 but	 I	 have	 had	 enough	 of	 the	 story.	 Others
would	like	to	find	me:	Link	and	his	boys;	Roy	Kemp	when	he	hears	I’m	talking	to
the	FBI;	perhaps	even	Arch	Swanger,	who’s	likely	to	phone	in	at	any	moment	and
ask	why	I	sang	to	the	police.
Partner	 takes	 me	 to	 Ken’s	 Kars	 and	 I	 drive	 away	 in	 a	 dented	 Mazda	 with
200,000	miles	on	it.	No	lawyer,	regardless	of	how	impoverished,	would	be	caught
dead	in	such	a	vehicle.	I	know	one	who	was	leasing	a	Maserati	when	he	was	forced
into	bankruptcy.
I	spend	the	rest	of	the	day	in	my	apartment,	hiding	and	working	on	two	cases.
Around	five	o’clock,	I	call	Judith	to	check	on	Starcher.	He’s	fine,	she	says,	and	the
reporters	 have	 gone	 away.	 I	 check	 the	 local	 news	 where	 the	 “dramatic	 rescue”	 is
the	lead	story.	They	use	some	old	footage	of	me	walking	into	the	police	station	and
make	it	sound	like	I	risked	my	life	to	save	my	son.	The	fools	are	swallowing	all	the
bait	the	police	give	them.	This	too	shall	pass.
Because	I’ve	slept	about	six	hours	out	of	the	last	seventy-two,	I	finally	collapse
on	the	sofa	and	fall	into	a	coma.	Just	after	10:00	p.m.,	my	cell	phone	rings.	I	check
the	 caller	 ID,	 then	 grab	 it.	 It’s	 Naomi	 Tarrant,	 Starcher’s	 teacher,	 the	 gorgeous
young	thing	I’ve	been	fantasizing	about	for	months.	I’ve	asked	her	to	dinner	five
times	and	have	been	hit	with	five	noes.	But,	the	rejections	have	been	progressively
softer.	I	have	neither	the	talent	nor	the	patience	for	the	usual	mating	rituals—the
stalking,	 the	 accidental	 encounters,	 the	 blind	 dates,	 the	 silly	 gifts,	 the	 awkward
phone	calls,	the	referrals	from	friends,	the	endless	Internet	chatting.	Nor	do	I	have
the	 guts	 to	 go	 online	 and	 lie	 about	 myself	 to	 strange	 women.	 And,	 I	 fear	 I’m
forever	 scorched	 and	 gun-shy	 from	 the	 Judith	 disaster.	 How	 can	 one	 human
possess	so	much	meanness?
Naomi	wants	to	talk	about	Starcher,	so	we	do.	I	assure	her	he	was	not	harmed
in	any	way.	He’ll	never	understand	what	really	happened,	and	I	doubt	anyone	will
tell	 him.	 Frankly,	 he	 was	 pampered	 for	 about	 forty-five	 hours	 by	 two	 people	 he
viewed	as	buddies.	He’ll	be	at	school	tomorrow	and	he	needs	no	special	attention.
I’m	sure	his	mother	will	arrive	with	a	long	list	of	demands	and	concerns,	but	that’s
his	mother.
“What	 a	 bitch,”	 Naomi	 says,	 dropping	 her	 guard	 for	 the	 first	 time.	 I’m
surprised	 by	 this,	 but	 love	 it	 nonetheless.	 We	 spend	 a	 few	 minutes	 thoroughly
trashing	Judith	and	Ava,	who	we	agree	is	an	airhead,	and	I	haven’t	had	this	much
fun	in	years.
From	left	field	she	says,	“Let’s	do	dinner.”	Ah,	the	life	of	a	hero.	The	power	of
celebrity.	 The	 reporters	 claim	 I	 risked	 my	 neck	 to	 save	 my	 son	 and	 women	 are
throwing	themselves	at	me.

We	establish	a	few	rules.	The	date	has	to	be	a	big	secret.	The	school	does	not
expressly	 forbid	 its	 unmarried	 teachers	 dating	 unmarried	 parents,	 but	 it’s
certainly	 frowned	 on.	 And	 why	 ask	 for	 trouble?	 If	 Judith	 found	 out,	 she	 would
probably	 file	 a	 complaint	 or	 a	 lawsuit	 or	 something	 from	 her	 bottomless	 bag	 of
dirty	tricks.
We	meet	in	a	dark,	low-end	Tex-Mex	joint	the	following	night.	Her	choice,	not
mine.	 Since	 no	 one	 speaks	 English	 no	 one	 will	 be	 listening.	 No	 one	 cares,
especially	me.	Naomi	is	thirty-three	years	old	and	rebounding	from	a	divorce.	No
kids,	no	discernible	baggage.	She	begins	by	telling	me	all	about	Starcher’s	day	at
school.	As	expected,	Judith	brought	him	early	and	had	some	instructions.	All	went
well;	 no	 one	 mentioned	 his	 little	 ordeal.	 Naomi	 and	 her	 classroom	 aide	 kept	 a
close	eye	on	him,	and,	as	far	as	they	could	tell,	nothing	was	said	by	his	friends.	He
seemed	 perfectly	 normal	 and	 went	 about	 the	 day	 as	 if	 nothing	 had	 happened.
Judith	picked	him	up	after	school	and	grilled	Naomi,	but	it	was	hardly	out	of	the
ordinary.
“How	long	were	you	married	to	her?”	she	asks	in	amazement.
“The	paperwork	says	less	than	two	years,	but	we	could	live	together	for	only
the	 first	 five	 months.	 It	 was	 unbearable.	 I	 tried	 to	 tough	 it	 out	 until	 the	 kid	 was
born,	but	then	I	found	out	she	was	already	seeing	her	latest	girlfriend.	I	fled,	he
was	 born,	 and	 we’ve	 been	 fighting	 ever	 since.	 Getting	 married	 was	 a	 horrible
mistake,	but	she	was	pregnant.”
“I’ve	never	seen	her	smile.”
“I	think	it	happens	about	once	a	month.”
The	margaritas	arrive	in	tall,	salty	mugs	and	we	dive	in.	We	briefly	touch	on
her	marriage,	then	move	on	to	more	pleasant	matters.	She’s	been	dating,	there	are
lots	of	calls,	and	I	can	understand	why.	She	has	soft,	beautiful	brown	eyes	that	are
hypnotic,	even	seductive.	The	kind	of	eyes	you	can	gaze	into	for	hours	and	wonder
if	they’re	real.
Me,	 I	 don’t	 date	 much,	 don’t	 have	 the	 time,	 too	 much	 work,	 and	 so	 on.	 The
usual	 disclaimers.	 She	 seems	 fascinated	 by	 my	 work,	 the	 unpopular	 cases,	 the
notoriety,	some	of	the	thugs	I	represent.	We	order	enchiladas	and	I	keep	chatting
away.	 I	 soon	 realize,	 though,	 that	 she	 follows	 the	 one	 rule	 of	 a	 great
conversationalist:	Keep	the	other	person	talking.	So	I	push	back	and	ask	about	her
family,	college,	other	jobs	she’s	had.
I	order	a	second	margarita,	she’s	half	finished	with	her	first,	and	we	go	back
and	 forth	 with	 stories	 about	 our	 past.	 A	 platter	 of	 enchiladas	 arrives	 and	 she
hardly	 notices.	 Judging	 by	 her	 figure,	 she	 has	 the	 appetite	 of	 a	 bird.	 I	 can’t
remember	the	last	time	I	had	sex,	and	the	longer	we	talk	the	more	I	am	consumed
with	that	subject.	By	the	time	I	finish	both	the	food	and	the	booze,	I’m	fighting	the
urge	to	lunge	across	the	table.

But	Naomi	Tarrant	is	not	impulsive.	This	will	take	time.	It’s	Tuesday,	so	I	ask
her	what	she’s	doing	Wednesday.	No	go.
“You	know	what	I’d	really	like?”	she	asks.
What?	Anything.
“This	may	seem	a	bit	odd,	but	I’m	really	curious	about	mixed	martial	arts.”
“Cage	fights?	You	want	to	go	to	the	cage	fights?”	I’m	stunned.
“Is	 it	 safe?”	 she	 asks,	 and	 mentions	 the	 little	 episode	 involving	 the	 riot	 and
Starcher’s	 close	 call	 with	 disaster.	 Judith	 sued	 me	 again	 and	 Naomi	 got	 a
subpoena	to	testify.
“If	there’s	no	brawl,	it’s	pretty	safe,”	I	say.	“Let’s	go.”	The	truth	is,	at	least	half
of	the	fanatics	who	show	up	at	the	fights	and	scream	for	blood	are	women.
We	book	a	date	for	this	coming	Friday.	I’m	thrilled	because	there	is	another
young	fighter	I	need	to	evaluate.	His	manager	has	contacted	me	and	needs	some
financial	backing.

8.
Not	surprisingly,	Doug	Renfro	has	not	done	well	since	his	wife	was	murdered
by	 one	 of	 our	 SWAT	 teams.	 The	 civil	 trial	 is	 two	 months	 away,	 and	 Doug	 is	 not
looking	forward	to	it.	He’s	had	his	day	in	court	and	he’s	not	ready	for	another	one.
I	 meet	 him	 for	 lunch	 in	 an	 empty	 deli,	 and	 I’m	 startled	 by	 his	 appearance.
He’s	lost	a	lot	of	weight,	pounds	that	he	needed.	His	face	is	gaunt	and	pale,	and	his
eyes	convey	the	pain	and	confusion	of	a	defeated	and	lonely	man.
He	nibbles	on	a	chip	and	says,	“I’ve	put	the	house	on	the	market.	I	can’t	stay
there,	too	many	memories.	I	can	see	her	in	the	kitchen.	I	can	feel	her	sleeping	in
the	 bed	 next	 to	 me.	 I	 can	 hear	 her	 laughing	 on	 the	 phone.	 I	 can	 smell	 her	 body
lotion.	She’s	everywhere,	Sebastian,	and	she’s	not	going	away.	Worst	of	all,	I	can’t
help	 but	 relive	 those	 last	 few	 seconds,	 the	 gunfire	 and	 screams	 and	 the	 blood.	 I
blame	 myself	 for	 so	 much	 of	 what	 went	 wrong.	 I	 often	 leave	 at	 midnight	 and	 go
find	a	cheap	motel	where	I	pay	sixty	bucks	and	stare	at	the	ceiling	until	sunrise.”
“I’m	sorry,	Doug,”	I	say.	“It	certainly	wasn’t	your	fault.”
“I	know.	But	I’m	not	rational.	Plus	I	hate	this	damned	city.	Every	time	I	see	a
cop	or	fireman	or	a	garbage	worker	I	start	cursing	the	City	and	the	fools	who	run
it.	I	can	no	longer	pay	taxes	to	this	government.	So,	I’m	outta	here.”
“What	about	your	family?”
“I’ll	 see	 them	 whenever	 I	 need	 to.	 They	 have	 their	 own	 lives	 to	 live.	 I	 gotta
take	care	of	me	this	time,	and	that	means	I	need	a	new	start	somewhere.”
“Where	are	you	going?”
“It	changes	every	day,	but	right	now	it	looks	like	New	Zealand.	As	far	away	as
I	can	get.	I’ll	probably	renounce	my	citizenship	so	I	won’t	have	to	pay	taxes	here.
I’m	a	bitter	old	man,	Sebastian,	and	I	have	to	get	away.”
“What	about	the	civil	trial?”
“I’m	 not	 going	 to	 trial.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 settle	 it	 as	 soon	 as	 you	 can.	 Hell,	 the
City’s	liability	is	only	a	million.	They’ll	pay	that,	won’t	they?”
“Yes,	I	assume.	I	haven’t	talked	settlement	with	them,	but	they	don’t	want	to
go	to	trial.”
“Is	there	a	way	to	get	more	than	a	million?”
“Maybe.”
He	slowly	takes	a	sip	of	his	tea	and	stares	at	me.	“How?”
“I’ve	 got	 some	 dirt	 on	 the	 police	 department.	 Some	 crap	 that’s	 pure	 filth.
Extortion	is	what	I’m	thinking.”

“I	like	it,”	he	says	with	a	smile,	the	first	and	only.	“Can	you	move	fast?	I	want
to	get	outta	here.	I’m	sick	of	this	place.”
“I’ll	see	what	I	can	do.”

9.
When	my	cell	phone	buzzes	after	midnight,	it’s	never	a	call	I	want	to	take.	At
12:02	I	pick	it	up	and	see	that	Partner	wants	to	talk.	“Hey,	Boss,”	he	says	in	a	weak
voice.	“They	tried	to	kill	me.”
“Are	you	okay?”
“Not	 really.	 I’ve	 got	 some	 burns	 but	 I’ll	 be	 all	 right.	 I’m	 at	 the	 hospital,
Catholic.	We	need	to	talk.”
I	 strap	 a	 Glock	 19	 under	 my	 left	 armpit,	 put	 on	 a	 heavy	 coat	 and	 a	 brown
fedora,	 and	 hustle	 down	 to	 the	 parking	 lot	 to	 retrieve	 my	 worn-out	 Mazda.	 Ten
minutes	later	I	enter	the	ER	wing	of	the	hospital	and	say	hello	to	one	Juke	Sadler,
one	 of	 the	 sleaziest	 lawyers	 in	 town.	 Juke	 roams	 the	 City’s	 emergency	 rooms
trolling	for	injured	clients.	Like	a	vulture,	he	loiters	in	the	hallways	watching	for
distraught	relatives	too	panicked	to	think	clearly.	He’s	been	known	to	have	lunch
and	 dinner	 in	 hospital	 cafeterias	 while	 passing	 out	 cards	 to	 those	 with	 broken
bones.	Last	year	he	got	in	a	fistfight	with	a	tow	truck	driver	who	was	hustling	the
family	of	a	fresh	car	wreck	victim.	Both	were	arrested	but	only	Juke	got	his	photo
in	 the	 newspaper.	 The	 bar	 association	 has	 been	 after	 him	 for	 years	 but	 he’s	 too
slick.
“Your	 man’s	 down	 the	 hall,”	 he	 says,	 pointing	 like	 one	 of	 those	 retired
hospital	 volunteers	 in	 pink	 jackets.	 They	 actually	 caught	 him	 once	 wearing	 that
jacket	 and	 posing	 as	 a	 greeter.	 They	 also	 caught	 him	 wearing	 a	 white	 collar	 and
black	jacket	and	pretending	to	be	a	priest.	Juke	is	an	unrepentant	slimeball,	but	I
admire	the	guy.	He	operates	in	the	dark,	murky	waters	of	the	law,	where	we	have
much	in	common.
Partner	is	in	a	gown,	sitting	on	an	exam	table,	his	right	arm	covered	in	gauze.
I	take	a	look	and	say,	“Okay,	let’s	have	it.”
He	was	leaving	an	all-night	chicken	carryout	restaurant	with	a	snack	for	him
and	his	mom.	He	got	in	the	van,	put	it	in	reverse,	and	the	damned	thing	blew	up.	A
bomb,	 probably	 of	 the	 gasoline	 variety,	 probably	 stuck	 to	 the	 fuel	 tank	 and
remotely	 detonated	 by	 someone	 sitting	 in	 a	 car	 nearby.	 Partner	 managed	 to
scramble	 out	 and	 remembers	 hitting	 the	 pavement	 with	 his	 jacket	 on	 fire.	 He
crawled	away	and	watched	the	van	turn	into	a	fireball.	Soon	there	were	cops	and
firemen	everywhere,	a	lot	of	excitement.	He	couldn’t	find	his	phone.	A	medic	cut
his	jacket	off	and	they	loaded	him	into	an	ambulance.	As	they	rolled	him	into	the
ER	someone	handed	him	his	phone.
“Sorry,	Boss,”	he	says.
“Not	exactly	your	fault.	As	you	know,	that	van	is	heavily	insured,	for	occasions
just	like	this.	We’ll	get	a	new	one.”

“I’ve	been	thinking	about	that,”	he	says,	grimacing.
“Oh	really?”
“Yeah,	Boss.	Maybe	we	get	something	that’s	not	quite	so	conspicuous,	so	easy
to	spot	and	follow.	Know	what	I	mean?	Like,	just	the	other	day	I	was	driving	along
the	expressway	and	I	got	passed	by	a	white	cargo	van	owned	by	a	flower	delivery
service.	 Standard	 white	 job,	 about	 the	 same	 size	 as	 ours,	 and	 I	 think	 to	 myself,
‘That’s	the	way	to	go.	No	one	ever	notices	a	white	van	with	lettering	and	numbers
painted	on	the	sides.’	And	it’s	true.	We	got	to	blend	in,	Boss,	not	stand	out	in	the
crowd.”
“And	what	exactly	do	we	paint	on	the	side	of	our	new	van?”
“I	 don’t	 know,	 something	 fictitious.	 Pete’s	 Parcel.	 Fred’s	 Flowers.	 Mike’s
Masonry.	Doesn’t	really	matter,	just	something	to	go	with	the	flow.”
“I’m	 not	 sure	 my	 clients	 would	 appreciate	 a	 generic	 white	 van	 with	 a	 fake
name	painted	all	over	it.	My	clients	are	very	discerning.”
He	 laughs	 at	 this.	 The	 last	 client	 to	 step	 into	 my	 van	 was	 Arch	 Swanger,	 a
likely	serial	killer.	A	young	doctor	suddenly	appears	and	steps	between	us	without
a	word.	He	examines	the	bandages	and	finally	asks	Partner	how	he	feels.	“I	wanna
go	home,”	he	says.	“I’m	not	staying	overnight.”
This	is	fine	with	the	doctor.	He	loads	Partner	down	with	bandages,	gives	him
some	 samples	 of	 painkillers,	 and	 disappears.	 A	 nurse	 has	 the	 discharge
instructions	and	paperwork.	Partner	puts	on	his	unburned	pants,	socks,	and	shoes
and	walks	out	with	a	cheap	blanket	wrapped	around	his	upper	body.	We	leave	the
hospital	and	drive	to	the	fried	chicken	restaurant.
It’s	almost	2:00	a.m.	and	a	police	cruiser	is	still	parked	near	the	crime	scene.
Strands	of	bright	yellow	tape	surround	the	van,	which	is	nothing	but	a	smoldering,
blackened	frame.	“Stay	here,”	I	say	to	Partner	and	get	out	of	the	car.	By	the	time	I
walk	forty	feet	and	stop	at	the	yellow	tape,	a	cop	is	coming	toward	me.
“That’s	far	enough,	pal,”	he	says.	“This	is	a	crime	scene.”
“What	happened?”	I	ask.
“Can’t	say.	It’s	under	investigation.	You	need	to	back	away.”
“I’m	not	touching	anything.”
“I	said	back	away,	okay?”
I	pull	a	business	card	out	of	my	shirt	pocket	and	hand	it	to	him.	“I	own	the
van,	okay?	It	was	a	gasoline	bomb	stuck	to	the	gas	tank.	Attempted	murder.	Please
ask	your	investigator	to	call	me	later	this	morning.”
He	looks	at	the	card	but	is	unable	to	put	together	a	response.
I	return	to	the	car	and	sit	in	silence	for	a	few	minutes.	“Want	some	chicken?”

I	finally	ask.
“No.	Not	much	of	an	appetite	now.”
“I	think	I’d	like	some	coffee.	You?”
“Sure.”
I	 get	 out	 of	 the	 car	 again	 and	 walk	 into	 the	 restaurant.	 There	 are	 no
customers,	 the	 place	 is	 dead,	 and	 the	 obvious	 question	 is,	 why	 does	 a	 chicken
place	stay	open	twenty-four	seven?	But	that’s	a	question	for	someone	else.	A	black
girl	 with	 steel	 in	 both	 nostrils	 is	 loitering	 by	 the	 cash	 register.	 “Two	 coffees
please,”	I	say.	“No	cream.”
This	pisses	her	off	but	she	starts	moving	anyway.	“Two	forty,”	she	says	as	she
grabs	a	pot,	one	that	probably	hasn’t	been	touched	in	hours.	As	she	sets	the	two
cups	on	the	counter,	I	say,	“That	van	out	there	belongs	to	me.”
“Well,	I	guess	you	need	a	new	van,”	she	retorts	with	a	sassy	smile.	How	clever.
“Looks	like	it.	Did	you	see	it	blow	up?”
“Naw,	didn’t	see	it,	but	I	heard	it.”
“And	 I’m	 betting	 that	 you	 or	 one	 of	 your	 co-workers	 ran	 outside	 with	 a	 cell
phone	and	caught	it	all	on	video,	right?”
She’s	nodding	smugly.	Yes.
“Did	you	give	it	to	the	police?”
A	grin.	“Naw,	don’t	do	nothing	to	help	no	PO-lice.”
“I’ll	give	you	a	hundred	bucks	if	you’ll	e-mail	me	the	video,	and	I	won’t	tell	a
soul.”
She	whips	her	phone	out	of	her	jeans	pocket	and	says,	“Gimme	your	address
and	the	cash.”
We	do	the	deal.	On	the	way	out	I	ask,	“Any	surveillance	cameras	outside?”
“Naw.	 PO-lice	 already	 asked	 about	 that.	 Man	 who	 owns	 this	 place	 is	 too
cheap.”
In	the	car,	Partner	and	I	stare	at	my	cell	phone	and	watch	the	video,	which	is
nothing	 more	 than	 the	 fireball	 he’s	 already	 described.	 At	 least	 two	 fire	 trucks
answered	 the	 call	 and	 it	 took	 a	 while	 to	 douse	 the	 flames.	 The	 video	 runs	 for
fourteen	minutes	and,	while	entertaining	because	it	is	my	van,	it	reveals	nothing
useful.	When	the	screen	goes	blank	Partner	asks,	“Okay,	who	did	it?”
I	reply,	“I’m	sure	it’s	Link.	We	punched	out	two	of	his	thugs	on	Monday.	Tit
for	tat.	We’re	playing	hardball	now.”
“You	think	Link’s	in	the	country?”
“I	doubt	it.	That	would	be	too	risky.	I’ll	bet	he’s	close	by,	though,	Mexico	or

the	Caribbean,	someplace	just	out	of	reach	but	someplace	that’s	easy	to	get	to	and
from.”
I	start	the	engine	and	we	drive	away.	I’m	impressed	with	how	much	Partner
has	talked	tonight.	The	excitement	of	getting	blown	up	has	loosened	his	tongue.	I
can	tell	he’s	in	pain	but	he	would	never	admit	it.
“You	got	a	plan?”	he	asks.
“Yes.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 find	 Miguel	 Zapate,	 Tadeo’s	 brother.	 Now	 that	 the
promising	MMA	career	is	over,	I’m	sure	Miguel	is	devoting	all	his	time	to	peddling
drugs.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 explain	 to	 Miguel	 that	 I	 need	 some	 protection;	 that	 I’m
representing	 his	 little	 brother	 on	 a	 murder	 rap	 for	 free,	 completely	 pro	 bono
because	I	love	the	kid	and	he	can’t	afford	to	pay	me;	and	that	I’m	getting	squeezed
by	some	thugs	who	work	for	Link	Scanlon.	Fango	is	one,	though	I’ve	never	known
his	real	name.”
“They	call	him	Tubby.	Tubby	Fango,	but	his	real	name	is	Danny.”
“Impressive.	 Who’s	 the	 other	 one,	 the	 one	 you	 plunked	 with	 your	 little
baton?”
“Goes	by	Razor,	Razor	Robilio,	real	name	is	Arthur.”
“Tubby	and	Razor,”	I	say,	shaking	my	head.	“When	did	you	take	care	of	this
bit	of	research?”
“After	the	altercation	on	Monday,	I	decided	to	snoop	a	little.	Wasn’t	that	hard,
really.”
“Nice	work.	So	give	the	names	to	Miguel	and	tell	him	that	he	needs	to	contact
these	 boys	 and	 tell	 them	 to	 back	 off.	 Miguel	 and	 his	 boys	 are	 running	 coke,
something	Link	had	control	of	thirty	years	ago.	It’s	unlikely	Tubby	and	Razor	have
crossed	 paths	 with	 Miguel,	 but	 you	 never	 know.	 There	 are	 always	 strange
connections	down	in	the	sewers.	Please	make	it	clear	to	Miguel	that	I	don’t	want
anyone	hurt;	just	some	intimidation.	Got	it?”
“Got	it,	Boss.”
We’re	in	the	projects.	The	streets	are	dark	and	empty.	However,	if	I	stepped
out	 of	 my	 car	 at	 this	 moment	 and	 showed	 my	 white	 face,	 I	 would	 immediately
attract	some	unpleasant	types.	I	made	that	mistake	once	before,	but,	thankfully,	I
had	 Partner	 with	 me.	 I	 pull	 to	 the	 curb	 outside	 his	 building	 and	 say,	 “I	 assume
Miss	Luella	is	waiting.”
He	 nods	 and	 says,	 “I	 called	 her,	 told	 her	 it	 was	 just	 a	 scratch.	 She’ll	 be	 all
right.”
“You	want	me	to	come	in?”
“No,	Boss.	It’s	pushing	three.	Go	get	some	sleep.”
“Call	me	if	you	need	anything.”

“You	got	it,	Boss.	Are	we	shopping	for	a	new	van	tomorrow?”
“Not	yet.	I	have	to	deal	with	the	cops	and	my	insurance	company.”
“I	need	some	wheels.	Mind	if	I	start	looking	online?”
“Go	right	ahead.	And	take	care.”
“You	got	it,	Boss.”

10.
Since	 I	 cannot,	 at	 this	 moment,	 stand	 the	 thought	 of	 being	 in	 her	 presence,
and	she	certainly	prefers	to	avoid	looking	at	me,	Judith	and	I	decide	to	hash	things
out	over	the	phone.	We	begin	somewhat	pleasantly	with	the	latest	update	on	our
son.	He’s	doing	well,	no	damage,	no	desire	to	really	talk	about	last	weekend.	With
that	out	of	the	way,	we	get	down	to	business.
Judith	has	decided	that	she	does	not	want	to	pursue	an	FBI	investigation	into
Roy	 Kemp	 and	 the	 kidnapping.	 She	 has	 her	 reasons	 and	 they	 are	 solid.	 Life	 is
good.	Starcher	is	fine.	If	Kemp	and	company	are	desperate	enough	to	snatch	a	kid
in	 return	 for	 information,	 then	 who	 knows	 what	 else	 they	 might	 do.	 Let’s	 leave
them	alone.	Besides,	proving	Kemp	was	involved	seems	impossible.	Can	we	really
trust	 the	 FBI	 to	 go	 after	 a	 high-ranking	 law	 enforcement	 official?	 Plus,	 her	 trial
calendar	 is	 packed.	 She	 doesn’t	 want	 the	 distraction.	 Why	 should	 we	 complicate
our	already	stressful	lives?
Judith	 is	 a	 fighter,	 a	 tough	 gal	 who	 backs	 down	 from	 nothing.	 She’s	 also	 a
conniving	 tactician	 who	 avoids	 the	 dangers	 of	 unintended	 consequences.	 If	 we
push	an	investigation	into	Kemp,	we	have	no	idea	what	might	happen	next.	And
since	 we’re	 dealing	 with	 a	 tough	 guy	 who’s	 not	 thinking	 clearly,	 it’s	 smart	 to
assume	retaliation	is	likely.
To	her	surprise,	I	do	not	argue.	We	reach	an	agreement,	a	rare	occurrence	in
our	relationship.

11.
Our	 mayor	 is	 a	 three-term	 guy	 with	 the	 imposing	 name	 of	 L.	 Woodrow
Sullivan	 III.	 To	 the	 public	 and	 the	 voters,	 he’s	 simply	 Woody,	 a	 smiling,
backslapping,	friendly	sort	who’ll	promise	anything	for	a	vote.	In	private,	though,
he’s	 an	 abrasive,	 sour	 prick	 who	 drinks	 too	 much	 and	 is	 fed	 up	 with	 his	 job.	 He
can’t	walk	away,	though,	because	he	has	no	place	to	go.	He’s	up	for	reelection	next
year	and	it	appears	as	though	he	has	no	friends.	Right	now	his	approval	rating	is
around	 15	 percent,	 low	 enough	 to	 force	 any	 proud	 politician	 to	 quit	 in	 disgrace,
but	Woody’s	fought	back	before.	He’d	rather	do	anything	than	suffer	through	the
meeting	we’re	about	to	have.
The	third	man	in	the	room	is	the	city	attorney,	Moss	Korgan,	a	classmate	of
mine	 in	 law	 school.	 We	 despised	 each	 other	 back	 then	 and	 things	 have	 not
improved.	He	edited	the	law	review	and	was	headed	for	a	gilded	career	in	a	fancy
corporate	law	firm,	one	that	imploded	and	left	him	scrambling	for	lesser	work.
Woody	and	Moss.	Sounds	like	an	ad	for	hunting	gear.
We	meet	in	the	mayor’s	office,	a	splendid	room	on	the	top	floor	of	City	Hall,
with	tall	windows	and	views	in	three	directions.	A	secretary	pours	coffee	from	an
old	silver	pot	as	we	take	our	places	around	a	small	conference	table	in	one	corner.
We	 struggle	 through	 the	 obligatory	 chitchat	 and	 make	 ourselves	 smile	 and	 act
relaxed.
Through	 discovery	 in	 the	 civil	 trial,	 I	 have	 let	 it	 be	 known	 that	 I	 intend	 to
subpoena	 both	 of	 these	 guys	 to	 the	 witness	 stand.	 This	 fact	 hangs	 over	 the	 table
like	a	dark	cloud	and	makes	professional	politeness	almost	impossible.
Woody	brusquely	says,	“We’re	here	to	talk	about	a	settlement,	right?”
“Yes,”	I	say,	and	remove	some	papers	from	my	briefcase.	“I	have	a	proposal,
one	that	is	rather	lengthy.	My	client,	Doug	Renfro,	prefers	to	settle	all	claims	and
get	on	with	his	life,	what’s	left	of	it.”
“I’m	listening,”	Woody	says	rudely.
“Thank	 you.	 First,	 the	 eight	 city	 cops	 who	 murdered	 Kitty	 Renfro	 must	 be
fired.	They	have	been	on	administrative	leave	since	the	murder,	and—”
“Do	you	have	to	use	the	word	‘murder’?”	Woody	interrupts.
“They	haven’t	been	convicted	of	anything,”	Moss	adds.
“We’re	not	in	a	courtroom,	okay,	and	if	I	want	to	use	the	word	‘murder,’	then
I’ll	use	it.	Frankly,	there	is	no	other	word	in	the	English	language	adequate	enough
to	describe	what	your	SWAT	boys	did.	It	was	murder.	It’s	embarrassing	that	these
thugs	 have	 not	 been	 terminated	 and	 that	 they’re	 still	 getting	 their	 full	 salaries.
They	have	to	go.	That’s	number	one.	Number	two,	the	chief	has	to	go	with	them.

He’s	 an	 incompetent	 jerk	 who	 should	 not	 have	 been	 hired	 in	 the	 first	 place.	 He
oversees	a	corrupt	department.	He’s	an	idiot,	and	if	you	don’t	believe	me,	then	ask
your	voters.	According	to	the	last	poll,	at	least	80	percent	of	the	people	in	this	city
want	him	fired.”
They	nod	gravely	but	cannot	make	eye	contact.	Everything	I’ve	said	has	been
said	 on	 the	 front	 page	 of	 the	 Chronicle.	 The	 city	 council	 passed	 a	 no-confidence
vote	by	three	to	one	against	the	chief.	But	the	mayor	won’t	fire	him.
The	 reasons	 are	 simple	 and	 complicated.	 If	 the	 eight	 warrior	 cops	 and	 their
chief	 are	 terminated	 before	 the	 civil	 trial,	 they	 would	 likely	 become	 hostile
witnesses	against	the	City.	It’s	best	if	they	remain	united	in	their	defense	against
the	Renfro	lawsuit.
I	continue,	“Once	the	lawsuit	is	settled	you	can	finally	terminate	them,	right?”
Moss	says,	“Need	I	remind	you	that	our	liability	is	capped	at	$1	million?”
“No,	 you	 need	 not.	 I’m	 very	 aware	 of	 that.	 We’ll	 take	 the	 million	 as	 a
settlement,	and	you	immediately	fire	the	eight	cops	and	the	chief.”
“Deal!”	 Woody	 practically	 yells	 across	 the	 table	 as	 he	 slaps	 it	 with	 a	 palm.
“Deal!	What	else	do	you	want?”
Even	though	the	City	is	on	the	hook	for	a	measly	million	bucks,	these	guys	are
terrified	 of	 another	 trial.	 During	 the	 first	 one,	 I	 exposed	 in	 dramatic	 detail	 the
gross	malfeasance	of	our	police	department,	and	the	Chronicle	broadcast	it	on	the
front	 page	 for	 a	 week.	 The	 mayor,	 the	 police	 chief,	 the	 city	 attorney,	 and	 the
council	members	were	in	bunkers.	The	last	thing	they	want	is	another	high-profile
trial	in	which	I	humiliate	the	City.
“Oh,	 I	 want	 a	 lot	 more,	 Mayor,”	 I	 say.	 Both	 look	 at	 me	 with	 blank	 faces.
Slowly,	fear	begins	to	form	in	their	eyes.	“I’m	sure	you	remember	the	story	of	my
little	 boy	 getting	 kidnapped	 last	 Saturday.	 Pretty	 frightening	 stuff	 but	 a	 good
ending	 and	 all	 that	 happy	 horseshit.	 What	 you	 don’t	 know	 is	 that	 he	 was
kidnapped	by	members	of	your	police	department.”
Woody’s	 tough-guy	 facade	 melts	 as	 his	 face	 droops	 and	 turns	 pale.	 Moss,	 a
former	 Marine,	 is	 proud	 of	 his	 perfect	 posture,	 but	 right	 now	 he	 can’t	 keep	 his
shoulders	 from	 sagging.	 He	 exhales	 as	 the	 mayor	 sticks	 a	 fingernail	 between	 his
teeth.	Their	eyes	meet	briefly;	identical	looks	of	terror.
With	a	bit	of	drama,	I	drop	a	document	on	the	table,	just	out	of	their	reach.	I
say,	 “This	 is	 a	 ten-page	 affidavit,	 signed	 by	 me,	 in	 which	 I	 describe,	 under	 oath,
the	kidnapping,	an	abduction	orchestrated	by	Assistant	Chief	of	Police	Roy	Kemp,
in	 an	 effort	 to	 coerce	 me	 to	 divulge	 the	 location	 of	 his	 missing	 daughter’s	 body.
Arch	 Swanger	 was	 never	 my	 client,	 contrary	 to	 what	 you’ve	 read	 and	 what	 you
believe,	but	he	did	tell	me	where	the	body	was	supposedly	buried.	When	I	refused
to	 pass	 along	 this	 information	 to	 the	 cops,	 my	 son	 was	 kidnapped.	 I	 caved,	 told
Detective	Reardon	what	I	knew,	and	a	full-scale	dig	took	place	at	the	location	last

Sunday	 night.	 They	 found	 nothing;	 the	 body	 was	 not	 there.	 Kemp	 then	 released
my	son.	Now	he	wants	me	to	forget	all	about	it,	but	that’s	not	going	to	happen.	I’m
working	with	the	FBI.	You	think	you	have	problems	with	the	Renfro	case,	just	wait
until	the	City	finds	out	how	rotten	your	police	department	really	is.”
“Can	you	prove	this?”	Moss	says	with	a	dry	throat.
I	tap	the	affidavit	and	reply,	“It’s	all	right	here.	There	is	surveillance	footage
from	the	truck	stop	where	I	found	my	son.	He	has	been	able	to	identify	one	of	his
abductors,	a	cop.	The	FBI	is	hot	on	the	trail	and	chasing	leads.”
This	is	not	entirely	true,	of	course,	but	how	could	they	know?	As	in	any	war,
the	truth	is	the	first	casualty.	I	remove	another	document	from	my	briefcase	and
place	 it	 next	 to	 the	 affidavit.	 “And	 this	 is	 a	 rough	 draft	 of	 a	 lawsuit	 I	 plan	 to	 file
against	 the	 City	 for	 the	 kidnapping.	 Kemp,	 as	 you	 know,	 is	 on	 administrative
leave,	still	on	your	payroll,	still	an	employee.	I’ll	sue	him,	the	department,	and	the
City	for	a	crime	that	will	be	front	page	from	coast	to	coast.”
“You	want	Kemp	fired	too?”	Moss	asks.
“I	don’t	care	if	Kemp	stays	or	goes.	He’s	a	decent	chap	and	a	good	cop.	He’s
also	a	desperate	father	who’s	going	through	hell.	I	can	give	him	a	break.”
“Mighty	nice	of	you,”	Woody	mumbles.
“What’s	this	got	to	do	with	the	settlement?”	Moss	asks.
“Everything.	I’ll	bury	the	lawsuit	and	forget	about	it,	get	on	with	my	life,	and
keep	a	closer	eye	on	my	kid.	But	I	want	another	million	bucks	for	Renfro.”
The	mayor	rubs	his	eyes	with	his	knuckles	as	Moss	sags	even	lower.	They	are
overwhelmed	 and	 for	 one	 long	 minute	 cannot	 piece	 together	 enough	 words	 to
respond.	Finally,	Woody	mumbles	a	rather	pathetic	“Holy	shit.”
“This	is	extortion,”	Moss	says.
“It	certainly	is,	but	right	now	extortion	is	a	few	notches	down	the	pole.	At	the
top	 is	 murder,	 followed	 by	 kidnapping.	 You	 don’t	 want	 to	 start	 a	 pissing	 contest
with	me.”
The	mayor	manages	to	stiffen	his	spine	and	say,	“And	how	are	we	supposed	to
find	another	million	bucks	to	pass	along	to	you	and	Mr.	Renfro	without	someone
leaking	it	to	the	press?”
“Oh,	you’ve	moved	money	around	before,	Mayor.	You’ve	been	caught	a	couple
of	times,	got	embarrassed	with	the	scandals,	but	you	know	the	game.”
“I	did	nothing	wrong.”
“I’m	not	a	reporter,	so	knock	it	off.	Your	budget	this	year	is	600	million.	You
have	 rainy-day	 funds,	 discretionary	 funds,	 slush	 funds,	 reserves	 for	 this	 and	 for
that.	You	can	figure	it	out.	The	best	route	may	be	to	deal	with	the	city	council	in
executive	session,	pass	a	resolution	to	reach	a	confidential	settlement	with	Renfro,

and	handle	the	money	offshore.”
Woody	laughs	but	not	because	of	anything	humorous.	“So	you	think	we	can
trust	the	city	council	to	keep	this	quiet?”
“That’s	 your	 problem,	 not	 mine.	 My	 job	 is	 to	 get	 a	 fair	 settlement	 for	 my
client.	Two	million	is	not	fair,	but	we’ll	take	it.”
Moss	 gets	 to	 his	 feet,	 looking	 dizzy.	 He	 paces	 to	 a	 window	 and	 stares	 out	 at
nothing.	He	stretches	his	back	and	paces	around	the	room.	Woody	seems	to	grasp
the	 reality	 that	 the	 sky	 is	 falling	 and	 asks,	 “Okay,	 Rudd,	 how	 much	 time	 do	 we
have?”
“Not	much,”	I	reply.
Moss	 says,	 “We	 need	 some	 time	 to	 investigate	 this,	 Sebastian.	 You	 come	 in
here,	drop	a	bomb	like	this,	and	expect	us	to	believe	everything.	There	are	a	lot	of
moving	parts	here.”
“Indeed,	 but	 an	 investigation	 will	 only	 cause	 leaks.	 And	 where	 will	 it	 take
you?	 You’re	 going	 to	 call	 in	 Kemp	 and	 ask	 him	 if	 he	 kidnapped	 my	 son?	 Gee,	 I
wonder	what	he’ll	say.	You	can	dig	for	months	looking	for	the	truth	and	you	won’t
find	 it.	 And,	 I’m	 not	 in	 the	 mood	 to	 wait.”	 I	 slide	 the	 affidavit	 and	 the	 lawsuit
across	the	table	in	Woody’s	direction.	I	stand	and	grab	my	briefcase.	“Here’s	the
deal.	Today	is	Friday.	You	have	the	weekend.	I’ll	be	here	at	ten	Monday	morning
to	wrap	things	up.	If	you	boys	can’t	figure	it	out,	I	go	straight	to	the	Chronicle	with
that	 little	 pile	 of	 papers.	 Imagine	 the	 story,	 the	 damage.	 Headlines	 on	 cable
around	the	clock.”
Woody	is	pale	again.	He	says	lamely,	“I’m	in	Washington	Monday.”
“Then	 cancel.	 Get	 a	 bad	 case	 of	 the	 flu.	 Ten	 Monday,	 gentlemen,”	 I	 say	 as	 I
open	the	door.

12.
Naomi	 is	 not	 too	 impressed	 with	 my	 rented	 Mazda.	 As	 we	 make	 our	 way
downtown	 toward	 the	 auditorium,	 I	 explain	 what	 happened	 to	 my	 other	 vehicle.
She	 is	 shocked	 that	 there	 are	 bad	 guys	 loose	 in	 the	 City	 who	 would	 attach	 an
explosive	device	to	my	van	to	intimidate	me	and	kill	Partner.	She	wants	to	know
how	 soon	 the	 police	 will	 catch	 these	 guys	 and	 bring	 them	 to	 justice.	 She	 doesn’t
understand	 when	 I	 explain	 that	 (1)	 the	 police	 have	 no	 real	 interest	 in	 catching
them	 because	 I	 am	 who	 I	 am	 and	 (2)	 the	 police	 can’t	 catch	 them	 because	 these
guys	don’t	leave	behind	clues.
She	asks	if	she’s	safe	in	my	company.	When	I	tell	her	I	have	a	gun	strapped	to
my	torso	and	wedged	just	under	my	left	armpit,	she	takes	a	deep	breath	and	gazes
out	the	window.	Sure,	we’re	safe,	I	promise	her.
In	 an	 effort	 at	 full	 disclosure,	 I	 tell	 her	 about	 my	 last	 office	 and	 the
firebombing.	 No,	 the	 police	 have	 not	 solved	 that	 crime	 either,	 primarily	 because
they	were	probably	involved	in	the	act.	Either	them	or	some	drug	dealers.
“No	wonder	you	struggle	with	women,”	she	observes.	And	she’s	right.	Most	of
them	 get	 spooked	 early	 in	 the	 game	 and	 gravitate	 toward	 safer	 men.	 Naomi,
though,	has	a	gleam	in	her	eye	and	seems	to	enjoy	the	threat	of	danger.	After	all,
the	cage	fights	were	her	idea.
I’ve	 pulled	 strings	 and	 our	 seats	 are	 ringside,	 third	 row	 back.	 I	 buy	 two	 tall
beers	 and	 we	 settle	 in	 to	 watch	 the	 crowd.	 Unlike	 the	 theater	 or	 cinema,	 or	 the
opera	or	symphony,	or	even	a	basketball	game,	the	fans	arrive	in	a	rowdy	mood,
many	of	them	already	half-drunk.	It’s	another	nice	crowd,	probably	three	to	four
thousand,	and	I	marvel	at	the	speed	with	which	the	sport	has	gained	popularity.	I
also	think	of	Tadeo,	a	talented	kid	now	sitting	in	jail	when	he	should	be	at	the	top
of	tonight’s	card.	His	trial	is	just	around	the	corner	and	he	still	expects	me	to	pull
a	 miracle	 and	 walk	 him	 out,	 a	 free	 man.	 For	 Naomi,	 I	 recount,	 in	 great	 graphic
detail,	the	night	not	too	long	ago	when	Tadeo	attacked	the	referee	and	this	entire
place	turned	into	a	riot.	Starcher	thought	it	was	cool	and	wants	to	return	for	more
fun.
She	thinks	that’s	a	bad	idea.
A	trainer	recognizes	me	and	stops	by	for	a	chat.	His	kid	is	a	150-pounder	who
fights	in	the	second	match	and	has	not	lost	in	his	last	six.	As	he	talks	he	can’t	keep
his	 eyes	 off	 Naomi.	 Because	 she’s	 a	 knockout	 and	 dressed	 fashionably,	 she’s
getting	plenty	of	looks.
The	trainer	thinks	his	kid	has	a	future	and	they	need	some	backing.	Since	I’m
viewed	as	a	big-shot	lawyer	with	plenty	of	cash,	at	least	in	this	world,	I’m	a	player
who	can	make	a	career.	I	tell	the	guy	we	can	talk	later.	Let	me	watch	the	kid	for	a

couple	of	fights	and	then	we’ll	meet.	The	trainer	asks	about	Tadeo	and	shakes	his
head	sadly.	What	a	waste.
When	the	place	is	packed,	the	lights	go	down	and	the	crowd	becomes	frantic.
The	first	two	fighters	enter	the	cage	and	introductions	are	made.
“You	know	these	guys?”	Naomi	asks	excitedly.
“Yes,	just	a	couple	of	brawlers,	not	much	talent.	Street	fighters	really.”
The	 bell	 sounds,	 the	 brawl	 is	 on,	 and	 my	 hot	 little	 schoolteacher	 sits	 on	 the
edge	of	her	seat	and	starts	yelling.

13.
At	midnight	we’re	in	a	pizza	dive,	tucked	into	a	narrow	booth	and	sitting	very
close	together.	There	has	been	some	touching	and	hand-holding	and	there	seems
to	 be	 a	 mutual	 attraction.	 I	 certainly	 hope	 it’s	 mutual.	 She	 nibbles	 on	 a	 slice	 of
pepperoni	 and	 prattles	 on	 about	 the	 main	 event,	 a	 heavyweight	 blood-fest	 that
ended	 with	 a	 vicious	 choke	 hold.	 The	 loser	 stayed	 on	 the	 mat	 for	 a	 long	 time.
Eventually,	 she	 gets	 around	 to	 the	 kidnapping	 and	 wants	 to	 know	 how	 much	 I
know.	I	explain	that	the	FBI	is	digging	and	I	can’t	say	anything.
Was	there	a	ransom	demand?	I	can’t	say.	A	suspect?	Not	that	I	know	of.	What
was	he	doing	at	that	truck	stop?	Eating	ice	cream.	I’d	like	to	give	her	the	details
but	it’s	too	early;	maybe	later,	when	everything	is	settled.
As	 we	 drive	 back	 to	 her	 place,	 she	 says,	 “It	 might	 be	 difficult	 to	 have	 a
relationship	as	long	as	you’re	wearing	a	gun.”
“Okay.	I	can	lose	it.	But	it	will	always	be	close	by.”
“I’m	not	sure	I	like	that.”
Nothing	else	is	said	until	I	park	outside	her	condo.	“I	had	a	great	time,”	she
says.
“So	did	I.”	I	walk	her	to	the	door	of	her	condo	and	ask,	“So	when	can	I	see	you
again?”
She	 pecks	 me	 on	 the	 cheek	 and	 says,	 “Seven	 tomorrow	 night.	 Right	 here.
There’s	a	movie	I	want	to	see.”

14.
Partner	 picks	 me	 up	 in	 another	 rental,	 a	 shiny	 new	 U-Haul	 cargo	 van	 with
“$19.95	 a	 Day—Unlimited	 Mileage”	 splashed	 on	 both	 sides	 in	 bright	 green	 and
orange	paint.	I	look	at	it	for	a	minute	or	so	before	finally	getting	in.	“Nice,”	I	say.
“I	thought	you’d	like	it,”	he	says,	grinning.	His	bandages	are	hidden	under	his
clothing;	there’s	no	evidence	of	his	wounds.	He’s	too	tough	to	admit	soreness	or
pain.
“I	guess	we’d	better	get	used	to	it,”	I	say.	“The	insurance	company	is	dragging
its	 feet.	 Plus	 it’ll	 take	 a	 month	 to	 get	 a	 new	 one	 customized.”	 We’re	 moving
through	 downtown	 traffic,	 just	 a	 couple	 of	 delivery	 boys	 with	 a	 van	 full	 of
furniture.	 He	 stops	 in	 front	 of	 City	 Hall	 and	 parks	 illegally.	 A	 U-Haul	 van	 with
such	vivid	colors	is	bound	to	attract	a	swarm	of	traffic	cops.
“I	chatted	with	Miguel,”	he	says.
“And	how	did	that	go?”	I	ask,	my	hand	on	the	door	handle.
“Okay.	I	just	explained	things,	said	you	were	getting	squeezed	by	some	tough
guys	and	needed	a	little	protection.	He	said	he	could	take	care	of	it,	said	it	was	the
least	he	and	the	guys	could	do	for	you	and	all	that	happy	crap.	I	emphasized	that
no	 one	 gets	 hurt,	 just	 a	 friendly	 hello	 to	 Tubby	 and	 Razor	 so	 they’d	 get	 the
message.”
“What	do	you	think?”
“It’ll	probably	work.	Link’s	gang	is	pretty	thin	these	days,	for	obvious	reasons.
Most	of	his	muscle	is	gone.	I	doubt	if	his	boys	want	to	mix	it	up	with	a	drug	gang.”
“We’ll	see.	Back	in	thirty	minutes,”	I	say	as	I	get	out.
Woody	canceled	his	trip	to	Washington	and	is	waiting	in	his	office	with	Moss.
Both	 look	 as	 though	 they’ve	 had	 a	 bad	 weekend.	 It’s	 Monday	 and	 my	 goal	 is	 to
ruin	the	rest	of	their	week.	There	are	no	handshakes,	no	forced	pleasantries,	not
even	the	offer	of	coffee.
I	jack	up	the	tension	with	“Okay,	boys,	do	we	have	a	deal?	Yes	or	no?	I	want
an	 answer	 now,	 and	 if	 I	 get	 the	 wrong	 answer	 I’ll	 leave	 this	 building	 and	 walk
down	 the	 street	 to	 the	 Chronicle.	 Verdoliak,	 your	 favorite	 reporter,	 is	 waiting	 at
his	desk.”
Woody	stares	at	the	floor	and	says,	“Deal.”
Moss	 slides	 across	 a	 document	 and	 says,	 “This	 is	 a	 confidential	 settlement
agreement.	 The	 insurance	 company	 will	 pay	 the	 first	 million	 now.	 The	 City	 will
kick	 in	 half	 a	 million	 this	 fiscal	 year,	 same	 for	 next.	 We	 have	 a	 litigation	 reserve
fund	we	can	manipulate,	but	we	need	to	split	the	two	payments	between	this	year

and	next.	It’s	the	best	we	can	do.”
“That’ll	work,”	I	say.	“And	when	will	the	chief	and	the	SWAT	boys	get	the	ax?”
“Tomorrow	morning,”	Moss	says.	“And	that’s	not	in	this	agreement.”
“Then	I	won’t	sign	the	agreement	until	they	are	terminated.	Why	wait?	What
is	 so	 difficult	 about	 getting	 rid	 of	 these	 guys?	 Hell,	 the	 whole	 city	 wants	 them
canned.”
“So	 do	 we,”	 the	 mayor	 says.	 “Believe	 me,	 we	 want	 them	 out	 of	 the	 picture.
Just	trust	us	on	this,	Rudd.”
I	roll	my	eyes	at	the	word	“trust.”	I	pick	up	the	agreement	and	read	it	slowly.
A	 phone	 buzzes	 on	 the	 mayor’s	 imposing	 desk	 but	 he	 ignores	 it.	 When	 I	 finish
reading,	I	drop	it	on	the	table	and	say,	“Not	one	word	of	apology.	My	client’s	wife
is	 murdered,	 he	 gets	 shot,	 then	 he	 gets	 dragged	 through	 a	 criminal	 trial,	 faces
prison,	goes	through	hell	and	back,	and	not	one	word	of	apology.	No	deal.”
Woody	utters	a	bitter	“Shit!”	and	jumps	to	his	feet.	Moss	rubs	his	eyes	as	if	he
might	start	crying.	Seconds	pass,	then	a	full	minute,	with	nothing	said.	Finally,	I
glare	at	the	mayor	and	say,	“Why	can’t	you	man	up	and	do	what’s	right?	Why	can’t
you	call	one	of	your	press	conferences,	just	like	you	do	for	every	other	minor	crisis,
and	start	with	an	apology	to	the	Renfro	family?	Announce	a	settlement	in	the	civil
case.	Explain	that	after	a	thorough	investigation	it’s	now	clear	that	the	SWAT	team
disregarded	 all	 rules	 of	 procedure	 and	 safety	 and	 that	 the	 eight	 cops	 are	 being
terminated,	immediately.	And	their	boss	goes	with	them.”
“I	don’t	really	need	your	advice	when	it	comes	to	doing	my	job,”	Woody	says,
but	it’s	a	lame	response.
“Maybe	 you	 do,”	 I	 say.	 I’m	 tempted	 to	 storm	 out	 again,	 but	 I	 don’t	 want	 to
lose	the	money.
“Okay,	 okay,”	 Moss	 says.	 “We’ll	 redraft	 it	 and	 throw	 in	 some	 language
addressing	the	family.”
“Thank	you,”	I	say.	“I’ll	be	back	tomorrow,	after	the	press	conference.”

15.
I	 meet	 Doug	 Renfro	 for	 lunch	 in	 a	 coffee	 shop	 near	 his	 home.	 I	 explain	 the
settlement,	 and	 he	 is	 thrilled	 to	 be	 getting	 two	 million.	 My	 contracted	 fee	 is	 25
percent,	but	I’ll	cut	it	to	only	10	percent.	He	is	surprised	by	this	and,	at	first,	wants
to	argue.	I’d	like	to	give	him	all	the	money,	but	I	do	have	some	overhead.	After	I
split	with	Harry	&	Harry,	I’ll	net	around	$120,000,	which	is	low	for	the	time	I’ve
spent	on	the	case,	but	still	a	decent	fee.
As	 he	 takes	 a	 sip	 of	 coffee,	 his	 hand	 starts	 shaking	 and	 his	 eyes	 suddenly
water.	He	sets	the	cup	down	and	pinches	the	bridge	of	his	nose.	“I	just	want	Kitty,”
he	says,	lips	quivering.
“I’m	sorry,	Doug,”	I	say.	What	else?
“Why	 did	 they	 do	 it?	 Why?	 It	 was	 so	 senseless.	 Kicking	 in	 the	 doors,	 guns
blazing	like	idiots,	the	wrong	house.	Why,	Sebastian?”
All	I	can	do	is	shake	my	head.
“I’m	 outta	 here,	 I’ll	 tell	 you	 that	 right	 now.	 Gone.	 I	 hate	 this	 city	 and	 the
clowns	who	run	it,	and	I	gotta	tell	you,	Sebastian,	with	these	eight	cops	now	out	of
work	and	pissed	off	and	looking	for	trouble,	I	don’t	feel	safe.	You	shouldn’t	either,
you	know?”
“I	know,	Doug.	Believe	me,	I	think	about	it	all	the	time.	But	then,	I’ve	pissed
them	off	before.	I’m	not	one	of	their	favorites.”
“You’re	 a	 helluva	 lawyer,	 Sebastian.	 I	 had	 my	 doubts	 at	 first.	 The	 way	 you
came	 on	 so	 strong	 while	 I	 was	 still	 in	 the	 hospital.	 I	 kept	 thinking,	 ‘Who	 is	 this
guy?’	 I	 had	 other	 lawyers	 try	 and	 hustle	 the	 case,	 you	 know?	 Some	 real	 clowns
poking	around	the	hospital.	But	I	ran	them	off.	Glad	I	did.	You	were	great	at	trial,
Sebastian.	Magnificent.”
“Okay,	okay.	Thanks,	Doug,	but	that’s	enough.”
“Fifteen	percent,	okay?	I	want	you	to	take	15	percent.	Please.”
“If	you	insist.”
“I	do.	My	house	sold	yesterday,	nice	profit.	We’ll	close	in	two	weeks.	I	think
I’m	going	to	Spain.”
“Last	week	it	was	New	Zealand.”
“It’s	a	big	world.	I	might	go	everywhere,	live	on	a	train	for	a	year	or	so.	See	it
all.	Just	wish	Kitty	could	be	with	me.	That	girl	loved	to	travel.”
“We	should	get	the	money	soon.	I’ll	see	you	in	a	few	days	and	divvy	it	up.”

16.
I	watch	the	press	conference	in	my	apartment.	At	some	point	in	the	last	few
hours,	 Mayor	 Woody	 has	 made	 the	 calculated	 decision	 that	 groveling	 might	 get
him	 more	 votes	 than	 stonewalling.	 He	 stands	 behind	 a	 podium,	 and	 for	 the	 first
time	 in	 recent	 history	 there	 is	 no	 one	 behind	 him.	 Not	 a	 soul.	 He’s	 all	 alone:	 no
city	 councilman	 hamming	 it	 up	 for	 the	 cameras;	 no	 wall	 of	 thick-necked
uniformed	officers;	no	grim-faced	lawyer	frowning	as	if	in	hemorrhoidal	agony.
He	explains	to	the	small	group	of	reporters	that	the	City	has	settled	its	legal
claims	with	the	Renfro	family.	There	will	be	no	civil	trial;	the	nightmare	is	over.
Terms	 confidential,	 of	 course.	 His	 deepest	 apologies	 to	 the	 family	 for	 what
happened.	 Mistakes	 were	 made,	 obviously	 (though	 none	 by	 him),	 and	 he	 has
made	the	decision	to	act	decisively	and	bring	this	tragedy	to	a	close.	The	chief	of
police	 is	 fired,	 as	 of	 now.	 He	 is	 ultimately	 responsible	 for	 the	 actions	 of	 his
officers.	All	eight	members	of	the	SWAT	team	are	also	terminated.	Their	actions
cannot	be	tolerated.	Procedures	will	be	reviewed.	And	so	on.
He	wraps	it	up	nicely	with	another	apology,	and	at	times	looks	and	sounds	as
though	 he’s	 ready	 to	 cry.	 Not	 a	 bad	 acting	 job	 for	 Woody	 and	 it	 might	 even	 win
him	some	votes.	But	any	fool	can	read	the	polls.
Gutsy	move,	Woody.
Now,	as	if	my	life	is	not	already	complicated	enough,	there	are	eight	more	excops	 loose	 on	 the	 streets	 mumbling	 my	 name	 and	 looking	 for	 some	 type	 of
revenge.
The	 money	 arrives	 soon	 enough	 and	 Doug	 and	 I	 do	 our	 business.	 The	 last
time	I	see	him	he’s	getting	into	a	taxi	headed	for	the	airport.	He	said	he’s	still	not
sure	where	he’s	going,	but	he’ll	figure	it	out	when	he	gets	there.	He	said	he	might
stare	at	the	departure	board	and	throw	a	dart.
I’m	hit	with	a	twinge	of	envy.

17.
Tadeo	insists	that	I	stop	by	the	jail	for	a	visit	at	least	once	a	week,	and	I	really
don’t	mind.	Most	visits	include	a	conversation	relating	to	his	upcoming	trial	and
others	that	have	nothing	to	do	with	anything	but	surviving	in	jail.	There	is	no	gym
or	place	to	exercise—he’ll	have	those	in	prison	but	we	don’t	talk	about	this—and	he
is	 frustrated	 in	 his	 efforts	 to	 stay	 in	 shape.	 He’s	 doing	 a	 thousand	 sit-ups	 and
push-ups	each	day	and	looks	fit	to	me.	The	food	is	terrible	and	he	says	he’s	losing
weight,	which	of	course	leads	to	a	discussion	about	his	preferred	fighting	weight
once	he	gets	out.	The	longer	he	stays	in	jail	and	the	more	free	legal	advice	he	gets
from	his	cell	mates	back	there,	the	more	delusional	he	becomes.	He’s	convinced	he
can	 charm	 a	 jury,	 blame	 it	 all	 on	 a	 quick	 bout	 of	 insanity,	 and	 walk.	 I	 explain,
again,	that	the	trial	will	be	hard	to	win	because	the	jury	will	see	the	video	at	least
five	times.
He’s	 also	 begun	 to	 doubt	 my	 belief	 in	 him,	 and	 on	 two	 occasions	 he’s
mentioned	 the	 involvement	 of	 another	 lawyer.	 This	 won’t	 happen	 because	 he’ll
have	to	pay	a	fat	fee	to	someone	else,	but	it’s	still	irritating.	He’s	beginning	to	act
like	a	lot	of	criminal	defendants,	especially	those	from	the	street.	He	doesn’t	trust
the	system,	including	me	because	I’m	white	and	part	of	the	power	structure.	He’s
convinced	 he’s	 innocent	 and	 wrongly	 locked	 up.	 He	 knows	 he	 can	 sway	 a	 jury	 if
given	 the	 chance.	 And	 I,	 as	 his	 lawyer,	 need	 only	 to	 work	 a	 few	 tricks	 in	 the
courtroom	and,	just	like	on	television,	he’ll	be	a	free	man.	I	don’t	argue	with	him
but	I	do	try	and	keep	things	realistic.
After	half	an	hour	I	say	good-bye	and	am	relieved	to	be	away	from	him.	As	I
work	 my	 way	 through	 the	 jail,	 Detective	 Reardon	 appears	 out	 of	 nowhere	 and
almost	bumps	into	me.	“Say,	Rudd,	just	the	man	I’m	looking	for.”
I’ve	 never	 seen	 him	 at	 the	 jail	 before.	 This	 encounter	 is	 not	 accidental.	 “Oh,
yeah,	what’s	up?”
“Got	a	minute?”	he	says,	pointing	to	a	corner	away	from	the	other	lawyers	and
jailers.
“Sure.”	 I	 don’t	 really	 want	 to	 spend	 time	 with	 Reardon,	 but	 he’s	 here	 for	 a
purpose.	I’m	sure	he	wants	to	drive	home	the	point	that	our	suspended	assistant
chief	 of	 police,	 Roy	 Kemp,	 continues	 to	 be	 deeply	 concerned	 about	 keeping	 the
kidnapping	 just	 between	 us	 boys.	 When	 we’re	 alone,	 he	 says,	 “Say,	 Rudd,	 I	 hear
you	 got	 in	 a	 scrape	 with	 a	 couple	 of	 Link	 Scanlon’s	 thugs	 in	 the	 courthouse	 last
week.	 Witnesses	 say	 you	 poleaxed	 both	 of	 them,	 knocked	 ’em	 cold.	 Too	 bad	 you
didn’t	put	a	bullet	between	their	eyes.	Wish	I	coulda	seen	it.	Hard	to	believe	you
got	the	balls	to	slug	it	out	with	a	couple	of	leg	breakers.”
“Your	point?”

“I	figure	Link	sent	word	to	you	that	he	wants	something,	probably	money.	We
know	about	where	he	is;	we	just	can’t	get	to	him.	We	think	he’s	broke	and	so	he
sends	a	coupla	goons	to	put	the	squeeze	on	you.	For	some	reason	you	don’t	want
to	 be	 squeezed.	 They	 push,	 you	 coldcock	 them	 in	 broad	 daylight	 outside	 a
courtroom.	I	like	it.”
“Your	point?”
“Do	you	know	these	two	guys?	I	mean,	their	names?”
Something	tells	me	to	play	dumb.	“One	is	called	Tubby,	no	last	name.	Don’t
know	the	other.	Got	time	for	a	question?”
“Oh	sure.”
“You’re	 Homicide.	 Why,	 exactly,	 are	 you	 concerned	 with	 Link	 and	 his	 thugs
and	me	having	some	fun	with	them?”
“Because	I’m	Homicide.”	He	whips	open	a	file	and	shows	me	an	eight-by-ten
color	photo	of	two	dead	bodies	in	some	sort	of	trash	heap.	They’re	lying	facedown,
with	their	wrists	tied	tightly	behind	them.	The	backs	of	their	necks	are	caked	with
dried	blood.	“Found	these	two	stiffs	in	the	city	landfill,	wrapped	in	an	old	piece	of
shag	 carpet.	 The	 bulldozer	 shoved	 it	 down	 a	 small	 embankment	 and	 Tubby	 and
Razor	rolled	out.	Tubby	is	Danny	Fango,	on	the	right	there.	Razor,	on	the	left,	is
Arthur	Robilio.”	He	shuffles	the	deck	and	pulls	out	another	eight-by-ten.	The	two
bodies	have	been	rearranged	and	are	lying	faceup,	side	by	bloody	side.	The	black
boot	of	a	cop	is	in	the	picture,	next	to	the	mangled	head	of	good	old	Tubby.	Their
throats	have	been	cut	wide	and	deep.
Reardon	says,	“Each	got	two	slugs	back	of	the	head.	That	plus	a	switchblade
from	 ear	 to	 ear.	 Does	 it	 every	 time.	 So	 far,	 clean	 killings,	 no	 prints,	 ballistics,
forensics.	 Probably	 a	 common	 gang	 thing,	 no	 big	 loss	 to	 society,	 know	 what	 I
mean?”
My	stomach	flips	as	acid	fills	my	throat.	There	is	a	strong	urge	to	vomit,	along
with	 a	 light-headedness	 that	 could	 mean	 a	 quick	 faint.	 I	 turn	 away	 from	 the
photos,	shake	my	head	in	disgust,	and	tell	myself	to	try,	if	humanly	possible,	to	act
unconcerned.	I	manage	to	shrug	and	say,	“So	what,	Reardon?	You	think	I	rubbed
these	guys	out	because	they	jumped	me	in	the	courthouse?”
“I	don’t	know	what	I’m	thinking	right	now,	but	I	got	these	two	Boy	Scouts	on
the	slab	and	nobody	knows	nothing.	As	far	as	I	know,	you	were	the	last	person	to
get	in	a	fight	with	them.	You	seem	to	enjoy	operating	down	in	the	gutter.	Maybe
you	got	some	friends	down	there.	One	thing	leads	to	another.”
“You	 can’t	 even	 sell	 that	 to	 yourself,	 Reardon.	 Weak	 as	 water.	 Go	 accuse
somebody	 else	 because	 you’re	 wasting	 time	 with	 me.	 I	 don’t	 kill.	 I	 just	 defend
killers.”
“Same	thing	if	you	ask	me.	I’ll	keep	digging.”

He	leaves	and	I	find	a	toilet.	I	lock	the	stall	door,	sit	on	the	lid,	and	ask	myself
if	it’s	possible.

18.
We	 park	 the	 U-Haul	 in	 a	 slot	 at	 a	 hot-dog	 drive-in	 and	 order	 sodas	 from	 a
cutie	on	skates.	Neither	of	us	has	an	appetite.	She	brings	the	drinks	and	Partner
rolls	 up	 the	 window,	 by	 hand,	 the	 old-fashioned	 way.	 He	 takes	 a	 long	 sip,	 and
staring	straight	ahead	says,	“No	way,	Boss.	I	made	myself	real	clear.	Scare	’em	but
don’t	touch	’em.	Nobody	gets	hurt.”
“They’re	not	in	pain,”	I	say.
“But,	 Boss,	 you	 gotta	 understand	 how	 things	 work	 in	 the	 gutter.	 Say	 Miguel
and	his	boys	track	down	Tubby	and	Razor	and	manage	to	create	a	confrontation.
They	 make	 threats,	 but	 let’s	 say	 Tubby	 and	 Razor	 are	 not	 bothered	 by	 threats.
Hell,	they’ve	been	making	’em	for	thirty	years.	They	don’t	appreciate	the	intrusion
and	 let	 it	 be	 known.	 Miguel	 has	 to	 stand	 his	 ground.	 Words	 get	 heated,	 more
threats	are	made,	and	at	some	point	things	get	outta	hand.	Takes	just	one	punch
to	start	a	brawl	and	before	long	somebody	pulls	a	gun	or	a	knife.”
“I	want	you	to	talk	to	Miguel.”
“Why?	He’ll	never	admit	it,	Boss.	Never.”
I	sip	through	the	straw	and	force	down	the	beverage.	Everything	seems	to	be
locked	 up—from	 throat	 to	 bowels.	 After	 a	 long	 gap,	 I	 say,	 “We’re	 assuming	 it’s
Miguel.	It	could	be	someone	else.	Tubby	and	Razor	have	spent	a	career	breaking
arms,	maybe	they	pushed	the	wrong	guy	this	time.”
Partner	nods	and	manages	a	weak	“Could	be.”

19.
I’m	awake	at	3:37	a.m.	when	my	cell	phone	begins	vibrating.	Slowly,	I	pick	it
up.	Caller	unknown,	the	worst	kind.	With	great	reluctance	I	say,	“Hello.”
I’d	recognize	the	voice	anywhere.	“This	Rudd?”	he	asks.
“It	is.	Who’s	calling?”
“Your	old	client	Swanger,	Arch	Swanger.”
“I	was	hoping	I’d	never	hear	from	you	again.”
“I	don’t	miss	you	either,	but	we	gotta	talk.	Since	you	can’t	be	trusted	and	don’t
hesitate	to	sacrifice	your	clients,	I’m	assuming	your	phone	is	tapped	and	the	cops
are	listening.”
“Nope.”
“You’re	a	liar,	Rudd.”
“Fine,	hang	up	and	don’t	call	me	back.”
“Not	 that	 simple.	 We	 gotta	 talk.	 That	 girl	 is	 alive,	 Rudd,	 and	 bad	 things	 are
going	on.”
“I	don’t	care.”
“There’s	 an	 all-night	 pharmacy	 at	 the	 corner	 of	 Preston	 and	 Fifteenth.	 Buy
some	 shaving	 cream.	 Behind	 a	 can	 of	 Gillette	 Menthol	 you’ll	 find	 a	 small	 black
phone,	 prepaid.	 Take	 it	 but	 don’t	 get	 caught	 shoplifting.	 Call	 the	 number	 on	 the
screen.	It’s	me.	I’ll	wait	thirty	minutes,	then	I’m	leaving	town.	Got	it,	Rudd?”
“No,	I’m	not	playing	this	time,	Swanger.”
“The	 girl	 is	 alive,	 Rudd,	 and	 you	 can	 bring	 her	 back.	 Just	 like	 you	 rescued
your	kid,	now	you	can	be	the	real	hero.	If	not,	she’ll	be	dead	in	a	year.	It’s	all	you,
buddy.”
“Why	should	I	believe	you,	Swanger?”
“Because	I	know	the	truth.	I	may	not	always	tell	the	truth,	but	I	know	what’s
going	on	with	the	Kemp	girl.	It	ain’t	pretty.	Come	on,	Rudd,	play	along.	Don’t	call
your	thug	and	don’t	use	that	goofy	U-Haul	van.	Seriously?	What	kind	of	lawyer	are
you?”
The	 line	 goes	 dead	 and	 I	 lie	 on	 my	 back	 and	 stare	 at	 the	 ceiling.	 If	 Arch
Swanger	is	on	the	run,	and	I	know	for	a	fact	that	he	is	because	he’s	number	one	on
our	cops’	most	wanted	list,	Link	Scanlon	being	number	two,	then	how	in	the	world
could	he	know	that	I’m	buzzing	around	town	these	days	in	a	rented	van?	And	how
could	he	purchase	and	hide	a	prepaid	cell	phone?

Twenty	minutes	later	I	park	in	front	of	the	pharmacy	and	wait	until	two	winos
move	 away	 from	 the	 front	 door.	 This	 is	 a	 sketchy	 part	 of	 town	 and	 it’s	 not	 clear
why	 this	 company,	 a	 national	 chain,	 would	 select	 this	 neighborhood	 for	 an	 allnight	drugstore.	I	walk	inside	and	see	no	one	except	for	the	clerk,	who’s	flipping
through	a	tabloid.	I	find	the	shaving	cream	and	the	phone,	which	I	quickly	stick
into	 a	 pocket.	 I	 pay	 for	 the	 shaving	 cream,	 and	 as	 I	 drive	 away	 I	 punch	 in	 the
number.
Swanger	answers	with	“Just	keep	driving.	Hit	the	interstate	and	go	north.”
“To	where,	Swanger?”
“To	 me.	 I	 want	 to	 look	 you	 in	 the	 eyes	 and	 ask	 you	 why	 you	 told	 the	 cops
where	I	buried	the	girl.”
“Maybe	I	don’t	want	to	talk	about	it.”
“You	will.”
“Why	did	you	lie,	Swanger?”
“It	was	just	a	test	to	see	if	you	can	be	trusted.	Obviously	you	cannot.	I	want	to
know	why.”
“And	I	want	to	know	why	you	can’t	leave	me	alone.”
“Because	I	need	a	lawyer,	Rudd,	plain	and	simple.	What	am	I	supposed	to	do?
Take	the	elevator	up	to	the	fortieth	floor	and	confide	in	a	guy	in	a	black	suit	who
charges	a	thousand	bucks	an	hour?	Or	maybe	call	one	of	those	bozos	you	see	on
the	billboards	begging	for	bankruptcies	and	car	wrecks?	I	need	a	real	guy	from	the
streets,	Rudd,	a	real	slimeball	who	knows	how	to	play	dirty.	Right	now	you’re	the
man.”
“No	I’m	not.”
“Take	the	White	Bluff	exit	off	the	interstate	and	go	east	for	two	miles.	There’s
an	 all-night	 burger	 joint	 currently	 advertising	 a	 double-patty	 melt	 with	 real
Velveeta	 cheese.	 Yum-yum.	 I’ll	 watch	 you	 go	 in	 and	 take	 a	 seat.	 I’ll	 make	 sure
you’re	alone	and	nobody’s	following	you.	When	I	walk	in	you	won’t	recognize	me
at	first.”
“I’ll	be	packing	some	heat,	Swanger,	permit	and	all,	and	I	know	how	to	use	it.
Nothing	funny,	okay?”
“No	need	for	that,	I	swear.”
“Swear	all	you	want	to,	but	I	don’t	believe	a	word	you	say.”
“Makes	two	of	us.”

20.
There	 is	 a	 lack	 of	 ventilation	 and	 the	 air	 is	 thick	 with	 the	 smell	 of	 greasy
burgers	and	fries.	I	buy	a	coffee	and	sit	at	a	table	in	the	center	for	ten	minutes	as
two	 drunk	 teenagers	 in	 a	 booth	 giggle	 and	 talk	 with	 their	 mouths	 full.	 In	 a	 far
corner	an	obese,	elderly	couple	gorge	themselves	as	if	they’ll	never	see	food	again.
Part	of	this	joint’s	marketing	brilliance	is	that	the	entire	menu	is	half	price	from
midnight	to	6:00	a.m.	That	and	the	Velveeta.
A	man	in	a	brown	UPS	uniform	enters	and	does	not	look	around.	He	buys	a
soft	 drink	 and	 some	 fries	 and	 is	 suddenly	 seated	 across	 from	 me.	 Behind	 round
frameless	glasses	I	finally	recognize	Swanger’s	eyes.	“Glad	you	could	make	it,”	he
says,	barely	audible.
“A	real	pleasure,”	I	say.	“Cute	uniform.”
“It	 works.	 Here’s	 what’s	 happening,	 Rudd.	 Jiliana	 Kemp	 is	 very	 much	 alive
but	I’m	sure	she	wishes	she	were	dead.	She	had	her	baby	a	few	months	back.	They
sold	it	for	fifty	thousand	bucks,	on	the	high	end.	The	range,	I’m	told,	is	twenty-five
to	fifty,	for	a	little	Caucasian	thing	from	good	stock.	The	darker	ones	go	cheaper.”
“Who	is	they?”
“We’ll	get	to	it	in	a	minute.	Right	now	she’s	working	long	hours	as	a	stripper
and	hooker	in	a	sex	club	a	thousand	miles	away.	She’s	basically	a	slave,	owned	by
some	nasty	types	who’ve	got	her	hooked	on	heroin.	That’s	why	she	can’t	leave	and
that’s	 why	 she’ll	 do	 whatever	 she’s	 told.	 Don’t	 suppose	 you’ve	 ever	 dealt	 with
human	trafficking?”
“No.”
“Don’t	ask	how	I	got	involved.	A	long	sad	story.”
“I	really	don’t	care,	Swanger.	I’d	like	to	help	the	girl	but	I’m	not	sticking	my
nose	into	it.	You	said	you	needed	a	lawyer.”
He	picks	up	a	single	fry	and	examines	it	as	if	looking	for	poison,	then	slowly
puts	 it	 into	 his	 mouth.	 He	 glares	 at	 me	 from	 behind	 the	 fake	 lenses,	 and	 finally
says,	“She’ll	work	the	clubs	for	a	bit,	then	they’ll	decide	to	breed	her	again.	They
pass	 her	 around,	 you	 know,	 and	 when	 she	 gets	 pregnant	 they’ll	 get	 her	 off	 the
drugs	and	lock	her	away.	The	baby’s	gotta	be	healthy,	you	know.	She’s	one	of	eight
or	 ten	 girls	 on	 their	 payroll,	 mostly	 white	 but	 a	 few	 brown	 ones,	 all	 from	 this
country.”
“All	abducted?”
“Of	course.	You	don’t	think	they	volunteered?”
“I	 don’t	 know	 what	 to	 think.”	 I	 hope	 he’s	 lying	 but	 something	 tells	 me	 he’s

not.	Either	way,	the	story	is	so	repulsive	I	can	only	shake	my	head.	I	can’t	help	but
see	the	images	of	Roy	Kemp	and	his	wife	on	the	news	pleading	for	a	safe	return	of
their	daughter.
“Real	 tragic,”	 I	 say.	 “But	 I’m	 losing	 patience	 here,	 Swanger.	 First,	 I	 can’t
believe	anything	you	say.	Second,	you	said	you	needed	a	lawyer.”
“Why	did	you	tell	the	cops	where	she	was	buried?”
“Because	they	kidnapped	my	son	and	forced	me	to	cough	up	what	you’d	told
me.”
He	likes	this	story	and	can’t	hold	back	a	smile.	“Really?	The	cops	kidnapped
your	son?”
“They	 did.	 I	 caved,	 told	 them,	 they	 raced	 out	 to	 the	 site,	 wasted	 an	 entire
night	digging,	and	when	it	became	apparent	you	were	lying,	they	released	my	kid.”
He	crams	three	fries	into	his	mouth	and	chomps	like	he’s	working	an	entire
pack	of	bubble	gum.	“I	was	in	the	woods,	watching,	laughing	my	ass	off	at	those
clowns.	I	was	also	cussing	you	for	telling	my	secret.”
“You’re	a	sicko,	Swanger.	Why	am	I	here?”
“Because	 I	 need	 money,	 Rudd.	 It	 ain’t	 easy	 living	 on	 the	 run	 like	 this.	 You
wouldn’t	believe	some	of	the	shit	I	have	to	do	to	generate	cash	and	I’m	sick	of	it.
There’s	about	150	grand	in	reward	money	sitting	in	a	pot	somewhere	in	the	police
department.	I	figure	if	I	can	get	the	girl	back	to	her	family,	then	I	should	get	some
of	the	money.”
I	don’t	know	why	I’m	shocked	by	this.	Nothing	this	idiot	says	should	surprise
me.	 I	 take	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 say,	 “Allow	 me	 to	 make	 some	 sense	 of	 this.	 You
kidnapped	the	girl	a	year	ago.	The	good	people	of	our	city	donated	their	cash	for	a
reward	fund.	Now	you,	the	kidnapper,	would	like	to	return	the	girl,	and	for	this	act
of	great	humanity	you	think	you	should	get	some	of	the	reward	money,	the	same
money	now	being	held	to	solve	the	crime	you	committed.	Right,	Swanger?”
“I	got	no	problem	with	that.	It	works	on	all	fronts.	They	get	the	girl;	I	get	the
cash.”
“More	of	a	ransom	deal,	I	think.”
“Call	it	what	you	like.	I	don’t	care.	I	just	gotta	have	some	cash,	Rudd,	and	I
figure	a	lawyer	like	you	can	make	it	happen.”
I	jump	to	my	feet	and	say,	“What	you	need	is	a	bullet,	Swanger.”
“Where	you	going?”
“Home.	And	if	you	call	me	again	I’ll	call	the	cops.”
“I’m	sure	you	will.”
Our	 volume	 has	 increased	 and	 the	 drunk	 teenagers	 are	 staring	 at	 us.	 I	 walk

away	 and	 manage	 to	 get	 outside	 before	 he	 catches	 me	 and	 grabs	 my	 shoulder.
“You	think	I’m	lying	about	the	girl,	don’t	you,	Rudd?”
I	quickly	grab	the	Glock	19	from	the	holster	under	my	left	armpit	and	grip	it
with	my	right	hand.	I	back	away	as	he	freezes,	staring	at	the	pistol.	I	say,	“I	don’t
know	if	you’re	lying	and	I	don’t	care.	You’re	a	sick	puppy,	Swanger,	and	I’m	sure
you’ll	die	an	awful	death.	Now	leave	me	alone.”
He	relaxes	and	smiles.	“You	ever	hear	of	a	town	called	Lamont,	Missouri?	No
reason	to,	really.	Podunk	place	of	a	thousand	people,	an	hour	north	of	Columbia.
Three	 nights	 ago	 a	 twenty-year-old	 girl,	 first	 name	 of	 Heather,	 disappeared.	 The
whole	 town’s	 in	 a	 panic,	 everybody’s	 in	 on	 the	 search,	 stomping	 through	 the
woods	 and	 looking	 under	 bushes.	 No	 sign	 whatsoever.	 She’s	 all	 right,	 I	 mean	 at
least	 she’s	 alive.	 She’s	 living	 in	 the	 same	 warehouse	 with	 Jiliana	 Kemp,	 westcentral	Chicago,	getting	the	same	abuse.	Check	it	out	online,	Rudd,	the	Columbia
paper	 ran	 a	 small	 story	 this	 morning.	 Just	 another	 girl,	 this	 one	 five	 hundred
miles	away,	but	these	guys	are	hard-core	traffickers.”
I	grip	the	pistol	even	tighter	and	resist	the	urge	to	raise	it	shoulder	high	and
put	a	couple	into	his	skull.

PART	SIX

THE	PLEA

1.
Jury	 selection	 in	 the	 trial	 of	 Tadeo	 Zapate	 begins	 on	 Monday.	 It	 will	 be	 a
circus	because	the	press	is	giddy	with	anticipation	and	the	courthouse	is	buzzing.
The	YouTube	video	of	Tadeo	laying	waste	to	the	referee	Sean	King	has	over	sixty
million	 hits.	 Our	 fearless	 Action	 News!	 heroes	 show	 it	 repeatedly	 during	 the
evening	and	morning	broadcasts.	Same	video,	same	drivel,	same	grim	shaking	of
heads	 as	 if	 it	 just	 can’t	 be	 believed.	 It	 seems	 as	 though	 everyone	 has	 an	 opinion
and	few	of	them	favor	my	client.	On	three	occasions	I	have	asked	the	court	for	a
change	of	venue,	and	all	three	requests	have	been	quickly	rejected.	Two	hundred
prospective	jurors	have	been	summoned	for	Monday,	and	it	will	be	fascinating	to
see	how	many	claim	to	have	no	knowledge	of	the	case.
Right	now,	though,	it’s	Friday,	around	midnight,	and	I’m	lying	naked	under
the	sheets	with	Ms.	Naomi	Tarrant	close	by.	She	is	sleeping,	purring	in	long	deep
breaths,	dead	to	the	world.	Our	second	session	began	around	ten,	after	pizza	and
beer,	 and	 though	 it	 lasted	 for	 less	 than	 half	 an	 hour	 it	 was	 nonetheless	 thrilling
and	utterly	exhausting.	We	both	admit	that	we’ve	been	a	bit	on	the	inactive	side,
and	 we’re	 having	 a	 grand	 time	 catching	 up.	 I	 have	 no	 idea	 where	 this	 nascent
relationship	might	be	headed,	and	I’m	always	overcautious—a	result	no	doubt	of
the	 permanent	 damage	 inflicted	 by	 Judith—but	 as	 of	 right	 now	 I	 adore	 this	 girl
and	would	like	to	see	her	as	often	as	possible,	naked	or	otherwise.
I	wish	I	could	sleep	like	that.	She’s	in	a	coma	and	I’m	lying	here	wide	awake,
not	 aroused—that	 would	 be	 normal—but	 thinking	 of	 so	 many	 things	 other	 than
sex.	 The	 trial	 Monday;	 Swanger	 and	 his	 tale	 about	 the	 Kemp	 girl;	 the	 bloody
bodies	 of	 Tubby	 and	 Razor,	 rolled	 up	 in	 old	 cheap	 carpet	 and	 dumped	 in	 the
landfill,	 probably	 by	 Miguel	 Zapate	 and	 his	 gang	 of	 drug	 dealers.	 I	 think	 of
Detective	Reardon	and	almost	shudder	at	the	idea	that	he	and	others	in	the	police
department	 suspect,	 either	 slightly	 or	 strongly,	 that	 I	 had	 something	 to	 do	 with
the	murders	of	Link’s	thugs.	I	wonder	if	Link	has	decided	to	leave	me	alone,	now
that	I	can	snap	my	fingers	and	get	people	whacked.
So	many	thoughts,	so	many	problems.	I’m	tempted	to	ease	out	of	bed	and	go
find	 some	 booze,	 then	 I	 remember	 that	 Naomi	 doesn’t	 keep	 the	 stuff	 in	 her
apartment.	She’s	a	light	drinker	and	a	healthy	eater,	and	she	does	yoga	four	days	a
week	to	keep	things	superbly	toned.	I	don’t	want	to	wake	her,	so	I	lie	still	and	stare
at	her	back,	at	the	smooth	perfect	skin	that	rises	and	falls	over	her	shoulder	blades
and	 lifts	 again	 to	 form	 the	 cutest	 bottom	 I’ve	 ever	 seen.	 She’s	 thirty-three	 years
old,	 recently	 divorced	 from	 a	 creep	 she	 wasted	 seven	 years	 with,	 childless	 and
seemingly	unconcerned	by	it.	She	doesn’t	talk	much	about	her	past	but	I	know	she
has	suffered	greatly.	Her	first	love	was	her	college	boyfriend	who	was	killed	by	a
drunk	driver	a	month	before	their	wedding	date.	With	moist	eyes,	she	told	me	she
could	never	love	another	man	that	much.

I’m	not	really	looking	for	love.
I	 cannot	 shake	 the	 thoughts	 of	 Jiliana	 Kemp.	 She	 is	 or	 was	 a	 beautiful	 girl,
like	my	companion	here,	and	there	is	a	good	chance	that	she	is	alive	and	living	a
life	that	is	indescribable.	Arch	Swanger	is	a	psychopath,	and	probably	a	sociopath,
and	 he	 would	 rather	 lie	 than	 tell	 the	 truth	 about	 anything.	 But	 he	 wasn’t	 lying
about	young	Heather	Farris,	late	of	the	village	of	Lamont,	Missouri,	a	twenty-yearold	dropout	who	was	working	the	graveyard	shift	at	a	convenience	store	when	she
vanished	 with	 no	 clues.	 They’re	 still	 combing	 the	 woods	 and	 bringing	 in
bloodhounds	 and	 offering	 rewards	 but	 nothing	 has	 worked	 so	 far.	 How	 did
Swanger	know	about	her?	It’s	possible	he	caught	an	early	news	report,	but	that’s
not	 likely.	 I	 went	 online	 immediately,	 found	 her	 story,	 and	 began	 following	 it	 in
the	Columbia	newspaper.	Lamont	is	over	five	hundred	miles	away	from	here,	and,
sadly,	she’s	just	another	missing	girl	from	a	small	town.	Heather	has	not	made	the
national	news.
What	 if	 Swanger	 is	 telling	 the	 truth?	 That	 Jiliana	 Kemp	 and	 Heather	 Farris
are	two	girls	out	of	a	dozen	who’ve	been	kidnapped	by	a	sex-trafficking	ring	and
forced	 to	 strip,	 screw,	 and	 breed	 while	 they	 live	 on	 heroin?	 The	 fact	 that	 I	 know
this,	or	at	least	suspect	it,	makes	me	feel	like	an	accomplice.	I	am	not	Swanger’s
lawyer	and	I	made	that	very	clear.	Indeed,	I	felt	a	real	rush	of	adrenaline	when	I
gripped	my	Glock	and	thought	about	putting	him	out	of	his	misery.	There	are	no
ethical	 constraints	 binding	 me	 to	 silence	 and	 confidentiality	 with	 this	 scumbag.
And	even	if	there	were,	I	would	be	inclined	to	ignore	them	if	doing	so	might	save
some	girls.
I	stopped	worrying	about	ethics	a	long	time	ago.	In	my	world,	my	enemies	are
ruthless.	If	I	make	nice,	I	get	crushed.
It	is	now	1:00	a.m.	and	I’m	even	wider	awake.	Naomi	rolls	over	and	flings	a
leg	 in	 my	 direction.	 I	 gently	 stroke	 her	 thigh—how	 can	 flesh	 be	 so	 smooth—and
she	whimpers	as	if	somewhere	in	her	deep	sleep	she	likes	the	touching.	I	manage
to	get	still	and	close	my	eyes.
My	 last	 thought	 is	 of	 Jiliana	 Kemp,	 living	 in	 our	 generation’s	 version	 of
slavery.

2.
Partner	 and	 I	 spend	 most	 of	 Saturday	 in	 the	 basement	 of	 the	 law	 offices	 of
Harry	 &	 Harry,	 poring	 over	 juror	 questionnaires	 and	 ponderous	 reports	 put
together	by	Cliff,	a	jury	consultant,	who,	so	far,	has	billed	me	$30,000.	The	tally
for	Tadeo’s	defense	is	just	under	$70,000,	all	from	my	pocket	of	course,	and	it	will
continue	to	climb.	He	and	I	have	not	discussed	the	payment	of	fees	because	it’s	a
waste	 of	 time.	 He’s	 broke,	 and	 Miguel	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 drug	 gang	 have	 little
interest	 in	 my	 compensation.	 They	 figure	 I	 made	 enough	 money	 from	 Tadeo’s
brief	career.	I	assume	they	also	think	that	in	the	rules	of	the	streets	the	removal	of
Tubby	and	Razor	is	worth	a	bundle.	Tit	for	tat.	We’re	all	even.
Cliff	is	of	the	opinion	that	the	defense	of	Tadeo	Zapate	has	quite	a	mountain
to	 climb.	 He	 and	 his	 firm	 have	 done	 their	 usual	 work	 of	 (1)	 polling	 a	 thousand
registered	voters	in	this	metropolitan	area	and	asking	hypothetical	questions;	(2)
hurriedly	researching	the	backgrounds	of	all	two	hundred	prospective	jurors;	and
(3)	 reviewing	 every	 news	 report	 that	 mentions	 the	 ugly	 incident	 in	 which	 Sean
King	 was	 beaten.	 From	 the	 poll,	 an	 astonishing	 31	 percent	 of	 those	 questioned
know	 a	 little	 or	 a	 lot	 about	 the	 case,	 and	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 these	 favor
conviction.	 Eighteen	 percent	 have	 seen	 the	 video.	 In	 the	 garden-variety	 murder
case,	 regardless	 of	 how	 sensational,	 finding	 10	 percent	 who	 are	 aware	 of	 it	 is
unusual.
Unlike	 most	 consultants,	 Cliff	 is	 known	 for	 his	 bluntness.	 That’s	 why	 I	 use
him.	 His	 bottom	 line:	 “Chances	 of	 an	 acquittal	 are	 slim.	 Chances	 of	 a	 conviction
are	high.	Cut	a	deal;	negotiate	a	plea	bargain.	Run	for	the	hills.”
When	 I	 first	 read	 his	 report,	 I	 called	 him	 immediately	 and	 said,	 “Come	 on,
Cliff,	I’m	paying	you	all	this	money	and	your	best	advice	is	to	run	for	the	hills?”
He’s	a	real	smart-ass	and	his	reply	was	“No,	actually,	I’d	sprint	for	the	hills.
Your	client	is	toast	and	the	jury	will	throw	the	book	at	him.”
Cliff	will	be	in	the	courtroom	Monday	watching	and	taking	notes.	As	much	as
I	love	the	cameras	and	the	attention,	I’m	not	looking	forward	to	it.

3.
At	 4:00	 p.m.,	 Partner	 and	 I	 climb	 into	 my	 sparkling-new	 customized	 Ford
cargo	 van,	 complete	 with	 all	 the	 usual	 finery	 I	 need	 for	 such	 a	 splendid	 mobile
office,	 and	 head	 for	 the	 university.	 At	 Partner’s	 suggestion,	 I	 agreed	 to	 tone	 it
down,	 to	 move	 away	 from	 conspicuous	 black	 to	 more	 of	 a	 soft	 bronze	 exterior
color.	 Painted	 on	 both	 sides,	 in	 small	 block	 letters,	 are	 the	 words	 “Smith
Contractors,”	 another	 nice	 touch	 Partner	 really	 wanted.	 He’s	 convinced	 that	 we
will	now	blend	in	with	the	world	and	be	harder	to	spot	by	the	police,	Link,	my	own
clients,	and	all	the	other	bad	guys,	real	and	potential,	lurking	out	there.
He	drops	me	off	in	front	of	the	university’s	aquatic	center	and	leaves	in	search
of	 a	 suitable	 parking	 place.	 I	 drift	 inside,	 hear	 the	 echoing	 voices,	 find	 the	 pool,
and	send	a	text	message	to	Moss	Korgan.	Swarms	of	small,	skinny	kids	are	heavily
involved	 in	 a	 swim	 meet.	 The	 bleachers	 are	 half-packed	 with	 noisy	 parents.	 A
breaststroke	race	is	under	way	and	little	girls	splash	and	kick	in	all	eight	lanes	of
the	fifty-meter	pool.
Moss	replies,	“Right	side,	third	section,	top	row.”
I	look	and	see	no	one,	but	I’m	sure	he’s	watching.	I’m	wearing	a	leather	jacket
with	my	long	hair	under	the	collar,	along	with	jeans	and	a	blue-and-orange	Mets
cap.	This	is	really	not	my	crowd	and	I	don’t	expect	to	be	recognized,	but	I	rarely
take	chances.	Just	last	week	Partner	and	I	were	having	a	sandwich	in	a	café	when
a	 jerk	 walked	 over	 and	 informed	 me	 that,	 in	 his	 opinion,	 my	 little	 cage	 fighter
should	 rot	 in	 jail	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 his	 life.	 I	 thanked	 him	 and	 asked	 him	 to	 please
leave	us	alone.	He	called	me	a	crook.	Partner	stood	and	the	guy	got	lost.
As	 I	 climb	 the	 steps	 I	 get	 a	 nose	 full	 of	 the	 smell	 of	 chlorine.	 Starcher	 once
mentioned	 swimming,	 but	 one	 of	 his	 mothers	 told	 him	 the	 sport	 was	 too
dangerous	 because	 of	 all	 the	 chemicals	 they	 put	 in	 the	 water.	 I’m	 surprised	 they
don’t	keep	the	kid	in	a	bubble.
I	sit	alone	for	a	moment,	far	away	from	anyone	else,	and	watch	the	action	in
the	 pool.	 The	 parents	 yell	 and	 the	 noise	 gets	 louder	 and	 louder	 until	 it	 suddenly
stops	 and	 the	 race	 is	 over.	 The	 kids	 pull	 themselves	 out	 of	 the	 water	 as	 their
mothers	wait	with	towels	and	advice.	From	here,	they	appear	to	be	about	ten	years
old.
Moss	rises	from	a	group	of	parents	across	the	pool	and	slowly	walks	around
it.	He	climbs	the	bleachers	in	front	of	me	and	eventually	takes	a	seat,	about	three
feet	away.	His	body	language	says	it	all—he	hates	where	he	is	and	would	rather	be
talking	 to	 a	 serial	 killer.	 “This	 better	 be	 good,	 Rudd,”	 he	 says	 without	 looking	 at
me.
“And	hello	to	you	too,	Moss.	Which	one	is	your	kid?”	Stupid	question;	there

are	about	a	thousand	of	them	down	there	crawling	around	the	pool.
“That	one,”	he	says	with	a	slight	nod.	What	a	smart-ass,	but	then	I	asked	for
it.	 “She’s	 a	 twelve-year-old	 freestyler.	 Won’t	 get	 wet	 for	 another	 thirty	 minutes.
Can	we	get	on	with	this?”
“I	 have	 another	 deal	 for	 you,	 and	 it’s	 even	 more	 complicated	 than	 the	 last
one.”
“That’s	what	you	said.	I	almost	hung	up,	Rudd,	until	you	mentioned	the	Kemp
girl.	Let’s	have	it.”
“Swanger	tracked	me	down	again.	We	met.	He	claims	to	know	where	she	is,
that	she	went	full	term	with	the	pregnancy,	the	baby	got	sold	by	some	traffickers
who	feed	her	heroin	in	exchange	for	all	manner	of	sexual	activities.”
“Swanger	is	a	proven	liar.”
“He	certainly	is	but	some	of	what	he	says	is	true.”
“Why	did	he	contact	you?”
“He	 says	 he	 needs	 help	 and,	 not	 surprisingly,	 he	 needs	 money.	 There’s	 a
chance	he’ll	contact	me	again,	and	if	he	does	I	can	possibly	put	the	police	on	his
trail.	 That	 trail	 might	 lead	 to	 Jiliana	 Kemp,	 or	 not.	 There’s	 no	 way	 to	 know,	 but
right	now	the	police	have	nothing	else.”
“So	you’re	sacrificing	your	client	again.”
“He’s	 not	 my	 client.	 I	 made	 that	 clear	 to	 him.	 He	 may	 think	 of	 me	 as	 his
lawyer,	but	it’s	a	waste	of	time	to	analyze	what	Arch	Swanger	might	be	thinking.”
A	 loud	 buzzer	 goes	 off	 and	 eight	 boys	 plunge	 into	 the	 water.	 Instantly,	 the
parents	start	yelling,	as	if	the	kids	can	hear	them.	Other	than	“Swim	faster!”	what
can	you	scream	at	a	splashing	kid	in	the	heat	of	a	race?	We	watch	them	until	they
make	the	turn.	Moss	says,	“And	what	do	you	want	from	us?”
“I	go	to	trial	Monday	with	my	cage	fighter.	I	want	a	better	deal.	I	want	a	fiveyear	 plea	 bargain	 with	 a	 guarantee	 that	 he	 serves	 his	 time	 in	 the	 county	 penal
farm.	It’s	a	softer	place.	There’s	a	nice	gym.	The	kid	can	stay	in	shape,	serve	about
eighteen	months,	get	paroled	when	he’s,	say,	twenty-four,	and	still	have	a	future	in
the	ring.	Otherwise,	he’ll	serve	fifteen	and	come	out	a	hardened	street	thug	with
only	one	thing	on	his	mind—more	crime.”
He’s	already	rolling	his	eyes.	He	exhales	in	disbelief,	as	if	everything	I’ve	just
said	is	a	complete	joke.	He	shakes	his	head;	I	must	be	an	idiot.
Finally,	 with	 great	 effort,	 he	 manages	 to	 say,	 “We	 have	 no	 control	 over	 the
prosecutor.	You	know	that.”
“Mancini	 was	 appointed	 by	 the	 mayor	 and	 confirmed	 by	 the	 city	 council,
same	as	you.	Our	interim	police	chief	was	appointed	by	the	mayor	and	confirmed
by	the	city	council.	Same	for	Roy	Kemp,	who’s	still	on	leave.	Can’t	we	find	a	way	to

work	together	here?”
“Mancini	won’t	listen	to	Woody.	He	hates	him.”
“Everybody	hates	Woody,	and	he	hates	everybody	right	back.	Somehow	he’s
survived	three	terms.	Here’s	how	you	sell	it	to	Woody.	Are	you	listening?”
He	has	yet	to	look	at	me,	but	now	he	turns	and	glares.	He	looks	back	at	the
pool	and	crosses	his	arms	over	his	chest,	my	signal	to	spill	it.
“Okay,	play	along,	Moss,	help	me	walk	through	this.	Let’s	assume	I	can	lead
the	 cops	 to	 Swanger,	 assume	 further	 that	 Swanger	 can	 lead	 the	 cops	 to	 Jiliana
Kemp.	 Somewhere	 in	 west-central	 Chicago,	 by	 the	 way.	 Assume	 they	 rescue	 the
girl,	and	guess	what?	Our	beloved	mayor,	the	Honorable	L.	Woodrow	Sullivan	III,
gets	to	hold	the	first	press	conference.	Imagine	that	scene,	Moss.	You	know	how
Woody	 loves	 a	 press	 conference.	 It	 will	 be	 his	 finest	 moment.	 Woody	 in	 a	 dark
suit,	all	smiles,	a	row	of	cops	behind	him,	all	grim-faced	but	happy	because	the	girl
has	 been	 saved.	 Woody	 makes	 the	 announcement	 as	 if	 he	 personally	 found	 her
and	 pulled	 off	 the	 miracle.	 An	 hour	 later	 we	 get	 our	 first	 glimpse	 of	 the	 happy
Kemp	family	reunited,	with	Woody,	of	course,	wedging	himself	into	the	photo	as
only	he	can	do.	What	a	moment!”
Moss	 softens	 a	 bit	 as	 he	 absorbs	 this	 visual.	 It	 rattles	 around	 his	 brain.	 He
wants	to	dismiss	it	and	tell	me	to	go	to	hell,	but	it’s	simply	too	rich.	Creativity	fails
him,	as	usual,	so	he	simply	says,	“You’re	crazy,	Rudd.”
No	 surprise.	 I	 press	 on	 with	 “Since	 we’re	 grasping	 for	 the	 truth	 here,	 and
making	bold	assumptions,	let’s	say	that	Swanger	is	not	lying.	If	so,	Jiliana	is	one	of
many	 girls	 snatched	 from	 their	 families	 and	 sold	 into	 bondage.	 Almost	 all	 are
white	American	girls.	If	their	ring	is	busted	and	the	traffickers	are	caught,	then	the
story	 echoes	 from	 coast	 to	 coast.	 Woody	 gets	 more	 than	 his	 share	 of	 the	 credit;
certainly	enough	to	shine	in	this	town.”
“Mancini	will	never	go	along.”
“Then	 fire	 Mancini.	 On	 the	 spot.	 Call	 him	 on	 the	 carpet	 and	 force	 his
resignation.	The	mayor	has	that	power	under	our	version	of	democracy.	Replace
him	with	one	of	those	little	ass-kissing	bureaucrats.	There	are	only	a	hundred	of
them.”
“I	think	there	are	fifteen,”	he	says.
“Sorry.	 So	 out	 of	 fifteen	 assistant	 city	 prosecutors,	 I’m	 sure	 you	 and	 Woody
can	find	one	with	a	bit	of	ambition,	one	who’ll	do	what	you	tell	him	or	her	to	do	in
exchange	for	the	big	office.	Come	on,	Moss,	this	is	not	that	complicated.”
He	 leans	 forward,	 deep	 in	 thought,	 elbows	 on	 knees.	 The	 noise	 fades.	 The
crowd	 goes	 quiet	 as	 one	 race	 ends	 and	 the	 next	 one	 starts	 to	 get	 organized.
Thankfully,	I’ve	never	been	to	a	swim	meet,	but	it	appears	as	if	this	ordeal	goes	on
for	hours.	I	thank	Starcher’s	mothers	and	their	fear	of	chlorine.

He	needs	some	help,	so	I	prod	on.	“Woody	has	the	power,	Moss.	He	can	make
this	happen.”
“Why	 does	 it	 have	 to	 be	 a	 deal?	 Why	 can’t	 you	 just	 do	 the	 right	 thing	 and
cooperate	with	the	police?	If	you	believe	Swanger,	and	if	he’s	really	not	your	client,
then	help	out	the	cops	here.	Hell,	you’re	talking	about	an	innocent	young	woman.”
“Because	I	don’t	work	that	way,”	I	say,	though	I’ve	lost	sleep	trying	to	answer
his	question.	“I	have	a	client	to	represent,	one	who’s	guilty,	as	most	are,	and	I’m
desperate	for	ways	to	help	him.	I	don’t	get	clients	who	have	the	potential	to	make
a	lot	of	money,	legally,	but	this	kid	is	different.	He	could	lift	himself	and	his	rather
large	and	growing	family	out	of	the	ghetto.”
“A	 ghetto	 here	 is	 better	 than	 where	 they	 came	 from,”	 he	 blurts,	 and
immediately	wishes	he	hadn’t	said	it.
Wisely,	and	uncharacteristically,	I	let	it	pass.
We	watch	a	group	of	taller	boys	limber	up	and	stretch	nervously	at	the	start.	I
say,	“There’s	something	else.”
“Oh,	a	multipart	deal.	What	a	surprise.”
“About	 a	 month	 ago,	 the	 cops	 found	 a	 couple	 of	 bodies	 at	 the	 landfill.	 Two
thugs	who	worked	for	Link	Scanlon.	For	some	reason,	I’m	a	suspect.	Don’t	know
how	serious	things	are,	but	I’d	rather	not	deal	with	it.”
“I	thought	Link	was	your	client.”
“He	was,	but	let’s	say	that	when	he	vanished	he	was	less	than	pleased	with	my
services.	He	sent	the	two	thugs	to	squeeze	some	money	out	of	me.”
“Who	whacked	them?”
“I	don’t	know	but	it	wasn’t	me.	Seriously,	you	think	I’d	run	the	risk?”
“Probably.”
I	 snort	 a	 cheap	 laugh.	 “No	 way.	 These	 guys	 are	 career	 goons	 with	 lots	 of
enemies.	Whoever	whacked	them	comes	from	a	long	list	of	folks	who	wanted	to.”
“So,	 let	 me	 get	 this	 straight.	 First,	 you	 want	 the	 mayor	 to	 force	 Mancini	 to
lighten	 up	 on	 your	 cage	 fighter	 so	 he	 can	 plead	 to	 a	 sweet	 deal	 and	 protect	 his
career.	 Second,	 you	 want	 the	 mayor	 to	 lean	 on	 the	 police	 department	 to	 look
elsewhere	for	whoever	rubbed	out	Link’s	boys.	And,	third,	what	was	third?”
“The	best	part.	Swanger.”
“Oh	 right.	 And	 in	 return	 for	 the	 mayor	 putting	 his	 neck	 on	 the	 block,	 you
might	be	able	to	help	the	police	find	Swanger,	who	just	might	be	telling	the	truth
and	who	just	might	be	able	to	lead	them	to	the	girl.	That	right,	Rudd?”
“That	covers	it.”
“What	a	crock	of	shit.”

I	watch	him	as	he	walks	down	the	aisle	in	the	bleachers	and	circles	around	the
far	 end	 of	 the	 pool.	 On	 the	 other	 side,	 he	 walks	 up	 four	 rows	 and	 returns	 to	 his
seat	 beside	 his	 wife.	 From	 far	 away,	 I	 stare	 at	 him	 for	 a	 long	 time,	 and	 he	 never
casts	even	the	slightest	glance	in	my	direction.

4.
C,	for	Catfish	Cave.	It’s	a	few	miles	east	of	town	in	a	dingy	suburb,	a	bedroom
community	 of	 tract	 houses	 built	 sixty	 years	 ago	 with	 materials	 designed	 to	 last
fifty	 years.	 The	 restaurant	 offers	 bargain	 buffets	 of	 fish	 and	 vegetables,	 all	 now
battered	and	fried	to	hell	and	back	but	previously	frozen	for	months,	even	years.
For	 only	 ten	 bucks,	 the	 customers	 can	 graze	 and	 gorge	 for	 hours	 without	 limits.
They	heap	their	platters	as	if	they’re	starving,	and	wash	it	all	down	with	gallons	of
sugary	tea.	For	some	reason	alcohol	is	served	but	people	do	not	come	here	for	the
booze.	Tucked	away	in	a	dark,	neglected	corner	is	an	empty	bar,	and	it	is	here	that
I	occasionally	meet	Nate	Spurio.
The	last	time	we	met	it	was	B	for	a	bagel	shop.	The	time	before	it	was	A,	for	an
Arby’s	 roast	 beef	 joint	 in	 another	 suburb.	 Nate’s	 career	 hit	 a	 dead	 end	 a	 decade
ago.	He	can’t	be	fired,	and,	evidently,	he	can’t	be	promoted.	But	if	by	some	chance
he	was	spotted	having	an	off-duty	drink	with	me,	he	would	find	himself	directing
traffic	 in	 front	 of	 an	 elementary	 school.	 He’s	 too	 honest	 for	 police	 work	 in	 this
town.
His	boss	is	a	Captain	Truitt,	a	decent	guy	who’s	very	close	to	Roy	Kemp.	If	I
want	to	deliver	a	message	to	Kemp,	the	path	begins	here	over	a	couple	of	drinks.	I
lay	 it	 all	 on	 the	 table.	 Nate	 is	 surprised	 that	 I	 hold	 even	 the	 faintest	 hope	 that
Jiliana	 Kemp	 is	 still	 alive.	 I	 assure	 him	 that	 I	 don’t	 know	 what	 to	 believe	 and
believing	anything	Swanger	says	is	probably	a	mistake.	But,	what	is	there	to	lose?
He	certainly	knows	something,	which	is	a	lot	more	than	our	investigators	can	say.
The	 more	 we	 talk	 and	 drink,	 the	 more	 Nate	 is	 convinced	 that	 the	 police
department	 and	 its	 union	 can	 pressure	 both	 the	 mayor	 and	 Max	 Mancini.	 Our
former	chief	of	police	was	an	idiot	who	allowed	our	force	to	become	what	it	is,	but
Roy	Kemp	is	still	held	in	high	regard	by	his	brothers.	Saving	his	daughter	is	worth
a	reduced	plea	bargain	for	every	defendant	now	sitting	in	jail.
I	 repeatedly	 caution	 Nate	 that	 finding	 her	 is	 against	 the	 odds.	 First,	 I’m	 not
sure	I	can	find	Swanger,	or	that	he’ll	want	to	see	me	again.	The	last	time	we	met	I
almost	shot	him.	I	have	the	prepaid	cell	phone	but	haven’t	used	it	since	our	last
meeting.	If	it	doesn’t	work,	or	if	he	doesn’t	answer	it,	then	we’re	out	of	luck.	And	if
I	meet	him	and	the	police	are	able	to	follow	him,	what	are	the	odds	that	he’ll	lead
them	to	the	strip	club	in	west-central	Chicago?	Pretty	slim,	I	think.
Nate	 has	 the	 emotional	 range	 of	 a	 monk	 but	 he	 can’t	 hide	 his	 excitement.
When	we	leave	the	bar	he	says	he’s	headed	to	Truitt’s	house.	There,	they’ll	talk	off
the	record,	and	he	expects	Truitt	to	immediately	inform	Roy	Kemp	that	a	possible
deal	is	brewing.	It’s	a	long	shot,	but	when	it’s	your	daughter	you’ll	try	anything.	I
urge	him	to	hustle	up;	the	trial	starts	tomorrow.

5.
Late	Sunday	night,	Partner	and	I	go	to	the	city	jail	for	the	last	pretrial	meeting
with	our	client.	After	half	an	hour	of	sniping	with	the	jailers,	I’m	finally	allowed	to
see	Tadeo.
The	 kid	 frightens	 me.	 During	 his	 time	 in	 jail,	 he	 has	 absorbed	 a	 lot	 of	 free
advice	 from	 his	 new	 pals,	 and	 he’s	 also	 convinced	 himself	 that	 he’s	 famous.
Because	of	the	video,	he	gets	a	lot	of	mail,	almost	all	of	it	from	admirers.	He	thinks
he’s	about	to	walk	away	from	the	trial	a	free	man,	beloved	by	many	and	ready	to
continue	 his	 brilliant	 career.	 I’ve	 tried	 to	 bring	 him	 back	 to	 reality	 and	 convince
him	that	the	people	writing	him	letters	are	not	necessarily	the	same	type	of	people
who’ll	be	sitting	in	the	jury	box.	The	letter	writers	are	from	the	fringe;	several	have
even	proposed	marriage.	The	jurors	will	be	registered	voters	from	our	community,
few	of	whom	have	any	fondness	for	cage	fighting.
As	always,	I	pass	along	the	latest	plea	offer	of	fifteen	years	for	second-degree
murder.	 He	 laughs	 with	 a	 cocky	 smirk,	 same	 as	 before.	 He	 doesn’t	 ask	 for	 my
advice	and	I	don’t	offer	it.	He’s	turned	down	fifteen	years	so	many	times	it’s	not
worth	discussing.	Wisely,	he	has	followed	my	advice	and	shaved	and	trimmed	his
hair.	 I’ve	 brought	 along	 a	 secondhand	 navy	 suit,	 with	 a	 white	 shirt	 and	 tie,	 an
outfit	 his	 mother	 found	 at	 Goodwill.	 On	 his	 neck	 below	 his	 left	 ear	 is	 a	 tattoo	 of
some	baffling	origin,	and	it	will	be	partially	visible	above	his	collar.	Since	most	of
my	 clients	 have	 tattoos	 I	 deal	 with	 this	 issue	 all	 the	 time.	 It’s	 best	 to	 keep	 them
away	 from	 the	 jurors.	 In	 Tadeo’s	 case,	 though,	 our	 jurors	 will	 be	 treated	 to	 his
astonishing	display	of	ink	when	they	see	the	video.
Evidently,	when	a	guy	makes	the	decision	to	become	a	cage	fighter,	his	first
stop	on	the	way	to	the	gym	is	the	tattoo	parlor.
There’s	a	gap	between	us	that’s	been	growing	for	some	time.	He	thinks	he’ll
walk.	I	think	he’ll	go	to	prison.	He	sees	my	doubts	of	a	successful	outcome	as	not
only	 a	 lack	 of	 confidence	 in	 him	 but	 also	 in	 my	 own	 ability	 in	 the	 courtroom.
What’s	really	bothersome	is	his	insistence	on	testifying.	He	truly	believes	he	can
take	the	stand	and	con	the	jury	into	believing	(1)	the	fight	was	stolen	from	him	by
Sean	 King,	 and	 (2)	 he	 snapped,	 attacked,	 blacked	 out,	 and	 went	 temporarily
insane,	and	(3)	now	feels	real	bad	about	it.	After	he	explains	everything	to	the	jury,
he	wants	to	make	a	dramatic,	emotional	apology	to	the	King	family.	Then	all	will
be	well	and	the	jury	will	rush	back	with	the	proper	verdict.
I	 have	 attempted	 to	 describe	 the	 rough	 treatment	 he’ll	 get	 when	 I	 turn	 him
over	 to	 Max	 Mancini	 for	 a	 bit	 of	 cross-examination.	 But,	 as	 usual,	 he	 has	 no
appreciation	 for	 what	 happens	 in	 the	 heat	 of	 a	 trial.	 Hell,	 I’m	 not	 always	 sure
what’s	about	to	happen.
None	of	my	warnings	register	with	Tadeo.	He	tasted	enough	glory	in	the	cage

to	 know	 what’s	 out	 there.	 Money,	 fame,	 adulation,	 women,	 a	 big	 house	 for	 his
mother	and	family.	It	will	all	be	his	soon	enough.

6.
It’s	 impossible	 to	 sleep	 the	 night	 before	 a	 jury	 trial	 opens.	 My	 brain	 is	 in	 a
state	of	hyped-up	overdrive	as	I	struggle	to	remember	and	organize	details,	facts,
things	 to	 do.	 My	 stomach	 roils	 with	 anxiety	 and	 my	 nerves	 are	 frayed	 and
popping.	 I	 know	 it’s	 important	 to	 rest	 and	 appear	 fresh	 and	 relaxed	 before	 the
jury,	but	the	truth	is	I’ll	look	the	same	as	always—tired,	stressed,	eyes	bloodshot.	I
sip	 coffee	 just	 before	 dawn	 and,	 as	 usual,	 ask	 myself	 why	 I	 do	 this.	 Why	 do	 I
subject	 myself	 to	 such	 unpleasantness?	 I	 have	 a	 distant	 cousin	 who’s	 a	 great
neurosurgeon	 in	 Boston,	 and	 I	 often	 think	 about	 him	 at	 moments	 like	 this.	 I
suppose	his	world	is	quite	tense	as	he	cuts	into	the	brain,	with	so	much	at	stake.
How	 does	 he	 handle	 it	 physically?	 The	 nerves,	 the	 butterflies,	 yes	 even	 diarrhea
and	nausea?	We	rarely	speak,	so	I’ve	never	inquired.	I	remind	myself	that	he	does
his	job	without	an	audience,	and	if	he	makes	a	mistake	he	simply	buries	it.	I	try
not	to	remind	myself	that	he	makes	a	million	bucks	a	year.
In	many	ways,	a	trial	lawyer	is	like	an	actor	onstage.	His	lines	are	not	always
scripted,	 and	 that	 makes	 his	 job	 harder.	 He	 has	 to	 react,	 to	 be	 quick	 on	 his	 feet
and	with	his	tongue,	to	know	when	to	attack	and	when	to	shut	up,	when	to	lead
and	 when	 to	 follow,	 when	 to	 flash	 anger	 and	 when	 to	 be	 cool.	 Through	 it	 all,	 he
has	to	convince	and	persuade	because	nothing	matters	but	the	jury’s	final	vote.
I	 eventually	 forget	 about	 sleep	 and	 go	 to	 the	 pool	 table.	 I	 rack	 the	 balls	 and
break	them	gently.	I	run	the	table	and	drop	the	8	ball	into	a	side	pocket.
I	have	a	collection	of	brown	suits	and	I	carefully	select	one	for	opening	day.	I
wear	brown	not	because	I	like	the	color	but	because	no	one	else	does.	Lawyers,	as
well	as	bankers	and	executives	and	politicians,	all	believe	that	dress	suits	should
be	either	navy	or	dark	gray.	Shirts	are	either	white	or	light	blue;	ties,	some	variety
of	 red.	 I	 never	 wear	 those	 colors.	 Instead	 of	 black	 shoes,	 today	 I’ll	 wear	 ostrichskin	 cowboy	 boots.	 They	 don’t	 really	 match	 my	 brown	 suit	 but	 who	 cares?	 With
my	 ensemble	 laid	 out	 on	 the	 bed,	 I	 take	 a	 long	 shower.	 In	 my	 bathrobe,	 I	 pace
around	 the	 den,	 delivering	 at	 low	 volume	 another	 version	 of	 my	 opening
statement.	I	break	another	rack,	miss	the	first	three	shots,	and	lay	down	my	cue
stick.

7.
The	 courtroom	 is	 packed	 by	 9:00	 a.m.,	 the	 appointed	 hour	 for	 all	 two
hundred	potential	jurors	to	show	up	and	get	processed.	And,	since	capacity	is	only
two	 hundred,	 there	 is	 gridlock	 when	 a	 horde	 of	 spectators	 and	 a	 few	 dozen
reporters	also	show	up	and	jockey	for	position.
Max	Mancini	struts	about	in	his	finest	navy	suit	and	sparkling	black	wingtips,
flashing	 smiles	 at	 the	 clerks	 and	 assistants.	 With	 all	 these	 people	 watching,	 he’s
even	 nice	 to	 me.	 We	 huddle	 and	 chat	 importantly	 as	 the	 bailiffs	 deal	 with	 the
throng.
“Still	fifteen	years?”	I	ask.
“You	got	it,”	he	says,	smiling	and	looking	at	the	audience.	Obviously,	between
Moss	 and	 Spurio,	 the	 word	 has	 not	 yet	 made	 its	 way	 to	 Max’s	 ears.	 Or	 maybe	 it
has.	Maybe	Max	was	told	to	cut	a	deal	and	get	a	plea,	and	maybe	Max	did	what	I
would	expect	him	to	do:	told	Woody	and	Moss	and	Kemp	and	everybody	else	to	go
to	hell.	This	is	his	show,	a	big	moment	in	his	career.	Just	look	at	all	those	folks	out
there	admiring	him.	And	all	those	reporters!
Presiding	 this	 week	 is	 the	 Honorable	 Janet	 Fabineau,	 quietly	 known	 among
the	lawyers	as	Go	Slow	Fabineau.	She’s	a	young	judge,	still	a	bit	on	the	green	side,
but	 maturing	 nicely	 on	 the	 bench.	 She’s	 afraid	 to	 make	 mistakes,	 so	 she’s	 very
deliberate.	And	slow.	She	talks	slow,	thinks	slow,	rules	slow,	and	she	insists	that
the	 lawyers	 and	 witnesses	 speak	 clearly	 at	 all	 times.	 She	 pretends	 this	 is	 for	 the
benefit	of	the	court	reporter	who	must	take	down	every	word,	but	we	suspect	it’s
really	because	Her	Honor	also	absorbs	things…real	slow.
Her	 clerk	 appears	 and	 says	 the	 judge	 wants	 to	 see	 the	 lawyers	 in	 chambers.
We	file	in	and	take	seats	around	an	old	worktable,	me	on	one	side,	Mancini	and
his	flunky	on	the	other.	Janet	sits	at	one	end,	eating	slices	of	apple	from	a	plastic
bowl.	They	say	she’s	always	fussing	over	her	latest	diet	and	her	latest	trainer,	but
I’ve	noticed	no	progress	on	the	reduction	front.	Mercifully,	she	does	not	offer	us
any	of	her	food.
“Any	more	pretrial	motions?”	she	asks	as	she	looks	at	me.	Chomp,	chomp.
Mancini	shakes	his	head	no.	I	do	the	same	and	add,	for	reasons	that	are	solely
antagonistic,	 “Wouldn’t	 do	 any	 good.”	 I’ve	 filed	 dozens	 and	 they’ve	 all	 been
overruled.
She	 absorbs	 this	 cheap	 shot,	 swallows	 hard,	 takes	 a	 sip	 of	 what	 looks	 like
early	morning	urine,	and	says,	“Any	chance	of	a	plea	bargain?”
Mancini	says,	“We’re	still	offering	fifteen	years	on	a	second	degree.”
I	say,	“And	my	client	still	says	no.	Sorry.”

“Not	a	bad	offer,”	she	says,	slinging	a	cheap	shot	back	at	me.	“What	would	the
defendant	take?”
“I	 don’t	 know,	 Your	 Honor.	 At	 this	 point,	 I’m	 not	 sure	 he’s	 willing	 to	 plead
guilty	to	anything.	Things	might	change	after	a	day	or	two	of	trial,	but	right	now
he’s	looking	forward	to	his	day	in	court.”
“Very	well.	We	can	certainly	accommodate	him.”
We	talk	about	this	and	that	and	kill	time	while	the	bailiffs	process	the	jurors
and	get	things	organized.	Finally,	at	10:30,	the	clerk	says	the	courtroom	is	ready.
The	 lawyers	 leave	 and	 take	 their	 places.	 I	 sit	 next	 to	 Tadeo,	 who	 looks	 a	 bit
awkward	all	dressed	up.	We	whisper	and	I	assure	him	things	are	going	swell,	just
as	I	expected,	so	far	anyway.	Behind	us,	the	prospective	jurors	stare	at	the	back	of
his	head	and	wonder	what	awful	crime	he	has	committed.
When	 instructed,	 we	 all	 rise	 in	 deference	 to	 the	 court,	 as	 Judge	 Fabineau
enters,	 her	 bulky	 figure	 nicely	 camouflaged	 by	 the	 long	 black	 robe.	 Because	 so
much	 of	 their	 dreary	 work	 is	 done	 without	 an	 audience,	 judges	 love	 crowded
courtrooms.	They	are	the	supreme	rulers	over	everything	in	sight	and	they	like	to
be	 appreciated.	 Some	 tend	 to	 grandstand,	 and	 I’m	 curious	 to	 see	 how	 Janet
conducts	 herself	 with	 so	 many	 watching.	 She	 welcomes	 everyone	 to	 the
proceedings,	 explains	 why	 we’re	 all	 here,	 rambles	 on	 a	 bit	 too	 long,	 and	 finally
asks	Tadeo	to	stand	and	face	the	crowd.	He	does	so,	smiles	as	I	instructed	him	to
do,	then	sits	down.	Janet	introduces	Mancini	and	me.	I	simply	stand	and	nod.	He
stands	 and	 grins	 and	 sort	 of	 opens	 his	 arms	 as	 if	 welcoming	 the	 people	 into	 his
domain.	His	phoniness	is	hard	to	stomach.
The	 jurors	 have	 now	 been	 numbered	 and	 Fabineau	 asks	 those	 holding	 101
through	198	to	leave	the	courtroom	and	take	a	break.	Call	the	clerk	at	1:00	p.m.
and	 see	 if	 you’re	 needed.	 Half	 of	 them	 file	 out,	 some	 in	 a	 hurry,	 some	 actually
smiling	 at	 their	 luck.	 On	 one	 side	 of	 the	 courtroom,	 the	 bailiffs	 place	 the
remaining	prospects	in	rows	of	ten,	and	we	get	our	first	look	at	the	likely	jurors.
This	 drags	 on	 for	 an	 hour	 and	 Tadeo	 whispers	 that	 he’s	 bored.	 I	 ask	 him	 if	 he
prefers	staying	in	jail.	No,	he	does	not.
The	pool	is	purged	of	those	over	the	age	of	sixty-five	and	those	with	doctors’
excuses.	The	ninety-two	we	are	now	staring	at	are	ready	to	be	examined.	Fabineau
breaks	for	lunch	and	we’re	told	to	be	back	at	2:00	p.m.	Tadeo	asks	if	there’s	any
chance	of	a	proper	lunch	in	a	nice	restaurant.	I	smile	and	say	no.	He’s	headed	back
to	the	jail.
As	I	huddle	with	Cliff,	the	jury	consultant,	a	uniformed	bailiff	approaches	and
asks,	“Are	you	Mr.	Rudd?”
I	nod	and	he	hands	me	some	papers.	Domestic	Relations	Court.	A	summons
for	 an	 emergency	 hearing	 to	 terminate	 all	 parental	 rights.	 I	 curse	 under	 my
breath,	 walk	 to	 the	 jury	 box,	 and	 take	 a	 seat.	 That	 bitch	 Judith	 has	 waited	 until
this	moment	to	further	complicate	matters.	I	read	on	and	my	shoulders	begin	to

sag.	 Yesterday,	 Sunday,	 was	 my	 day	 to	 spend	 with	 Starcher;	 twelve	 hours,	 from
8:00	 a.m.	 to	 8:00	 p.m.,	 a	 modified,	 verbal	 agreement	 between	 Judith	 and	 me.
Being	preoccupied	with	the	trial,	I	of	course	forgot	about	this	and	stiffed	my	kid.
In	Judith’s	twisted	way	of	thinking,	this	is	clear	proof	that	I’m	an	unfit	father	and
should	 be	 completely	 banished	 from	 my	 son’s	 life.	 She	 demands	 an	 emergency
hearing	 as	 if	 Starcher	 is	 in	 imminent	 danger,	 and	 if	 one	 is	 granted	 it	 will	 be	 the
fourth	in	the	past	three	years.	She’s	0	for	3!	And	she’s	perfectly	willing	to	go	0	for
4	to	prove	something.	What,	I	don’t	know.
I	 buy	 a	 once-frozen	 Fresh!	 Sandwich	 out	 of	 a	 machine	 and	 stroll	 down	 to
Domestic	Relations.	Machine	food	is	often	underrated.	Carla,	a	deputy	clerk	I	once
hit	on,	pulls	the	file	and	we	look	it	over,	our	heads	just	inches	apart.	When	I	hit	on
her	about	two	years	ago	she	was	“in	a	relationship,”	whatever	the	hell	that	means.
What	it	really	meant	was	that	she	had	no	interest	in	me.	I	took	it	in	stride.	I’ve	had
my	 balls	 busted	 so	 many	 times	 I’m	 surprised	 when	 a	 woman	 says,	 “Maybe.”
Anyway,	Carla	must	be	out	of	her	relationship	because	she’s	all	smiles	and	comeons,	 which	 is	 not	 that	 unusual	 among	 the	 army	 of	 deputy	 clerks	 and	 secretaries
and	 receptionists	 who	 clog	 these	 offices	 and	 hallways.	 A	 single	 straight	 male
lawyer	 with	 a	 little	 cash	 and	 a	 nice	 suit	 gets	 plenty	 of	 looks	 from	 the	 unmarried
ladies,	and	from	some	of	the	married	ones	as	well.	If	I	played	the	game,	had	the
time	 and	 interest,	 I	 could	 run	 these	 gals	 into	 the	 ground.	 Carla,	 though,	 has
chubbed	 up	 considerably	 in	 recent	 months	 and	 is	 not	 looking	 nearly	 as	 good	 as
before.
She	says,	“Judge	Stanley	Leef.”
“Same	one	as	last	time,”	I	reply.	“I’m	surprised	he’s	still	alive.”
“Looks	like	your	ex	is	a	tough	one.”
“That’s	a	huge	understatement.”
“She’s	in	here	from	time	to	time.	Not	very	friendly.”
I	thank	her,	and	as	I’m	leaving	she	says,	“Call	me	sometime.”
I	want	to	say,	“Well,	if	you’ll	hit	the	gym	for	about	six	months,	then	I’ll	take	a
look	and	consider	it.”	Instead,	and	because	I’m	such	a	gentleman,	I	say,	“Sure.”
Judge	Stanley	Leef	stiff-armed	Judith	in	her	last	effort	to	strip	me	of	parental
rights.	 He	 had	 no	 patience	 with	 her	 and	 ruled	 on	 the	 spot	 in	 my	 favor.	 The	 fact
that	she	rolled	the	dice	with	this	latest	filing	and	got	stuck	with	Leef	again	says	a
lot	 about	 her	 integrity,	 and	 her	 naïveté.	 In	 my	 world,	 if	 the	 case	 is	 critical—and
what	could	be	more	drastic	than	cutting	off	a	respectable	father’s	right	to	see	his
child—all	measures	must	be	taken	to	insure	a	fair	hearing	before	the	proper	judge.
This	might	require	the	filing	of	a	motion	to	ask	an	unwanted	judge	to	step	aside.	It
might	 require	 a	 complaint	 with	 the	 State	 Board	 of	 Judicial	 Ethics.	 My	 preferred
method,	though,	is	simply	a	cash	bribe	to	the	right	clerk.
Judith	would	never	consider	any	of	these	tactics.	Thus,	she’s	stuck	with	Leef

again.	 I	 remind	 myself	 that	 this	 is	 not	 about	 winning	 or	 losing,	 not	 about	 this
judge	 or	 that	 one.	 It’s	 nothing	 but	 abuse	 of	 the	 court	 system	 to	 harass	 a	 former
spouse.	 She	 has	 no	 worries	 about	 legal	 fees.	 She	 has	 no	 fears	 of	 retribution.	 She
roams	this	section	of	the	Old	Courthouse	every	day,	so	this	is	her	turf.
I	find	a	bench	and	read	her	petition	as	I	finish	my	sandwich.

8.
For	the	afternoon	session,	we	move	our	chairs	to	the	other	side	of	our	tables
and	 stare	 directly	 at	 the	 jurors.	 And	 they	 stare	 at	 us	 as	 if	 we’re	 aliens.	 Under
Fabineau’s	 selection	 scheme—and	 every	 trial	 judge	 is	 given	 great	 leeway	 in
devising	methods	to	pick	juries—those	with	numbers	one	through	forty	are	seated
in	the	first	four	rows,	and	from	there	we’ll	likely	find	our	final	twelve.	So,	we	zero
in	on	them	as	Her	Honor	rambles	on	about	the	civic	importance	of	jury	service.
Of	 the	 first	 forty,	 there	 are	 twenty-five	 whites,	 eight	 blacks,	 five	 Hispanics,
one	young	lady	from	Vietnam,	and	another	one	from	India.	Twenty-two	females,
eighteen	 males.	 Thanks	 to	 Cliff	 and	 his	 team,	 I	 know	 their	 names,	 addresses,
vocations,	 marital	 situations,	 church	 memberships,	 and	 histories	 of	 litigation,
unpaid	 debts,	 and	 criminal	 convictions,	 if	 any.	 For	 most	 of	 them,	 I	 have
photographs	of	their	homes	or	apartments.
Picking	 the	 right	 ones	 will	 be	 tricky.	 Carved	 in	 stone	 is	 the	 belief	 that	 you
want	all	the	black	jurors	you	can	get	in	a	criminal	trial,	because	blacks	have	more
sympathy	for	the	accused	and	a	greater	distrust	of	the	police	and	prosecutors.	Not
so	 today.	 The	 victim,	 Sean	 King,	 was	 a	 nice	 young	 black	 man	 with	 a	 good	 job,	 a
wife,	 and	 three	 clean-cut	 kids.	 For	 a	 few	 bucks	 on	 the	 side,	 he	 refereed	 boxing
matches	and	cage	fights.
When	 Fabineau	 finally	 gets	 around	 to	 the	 matters	 at	 hand,	 she	 asks	 how
many	in	the	pool	are	familiar	with	the	facts	surrounding	the	death	of	Sean	King.
Out	 of	 the	 ninety-two,	 about	 a	 quarter	 of	 the	 hands	 go	 up,	 an	 enormous
percentage.	She	asks	them	all	to	stand	so	we	can	jot	down	their	names.	I	glance	at
Mancini	 and	 shake	 my	 head.	 Such	 a	 response	 is	 unheard	 of	 and,	 in	 my	 opinion,
clear	proof	that	the	trial	should	be	moved.	But	Mancini	just	keeps	smiling.	I	write
down	twenty-two	names.
To	prevent	further	contamination,	Judge	Fabineau	decides	to	take	each	of	the
twenty-two	 and	 quiz	 them	 individually.	 We	 return	 to	 her	 chambers	 and	 gather
around	the	same	table.	Juror	number	three	is	brought	in.	Her	name	is	Liza	Parnell
and	 she	 sells	 tickets	 for	 a	 regional	 airline.	 Married,	 two	 kids,	 age	 thirty-four,
husband	 sells	 cement.	 Mancini	 and	 I	 are	 all	 charm	 as	 we	 attempt	 to	 curry	 favor
with	this	potential	juror.	Her	Honor	takes	charge	and	starts	questioning.	Neither
Liza	nor	her	husband	is	an	MMA	fan,	in	fact	she	calls	the	sport	disgusting,	but	she
remembers	 the	 riot.	 It	 was	 all	 over	 the	 news	 and	 she	 saw	 the	 video	 of	 Tadeo
pounding	away.	She	and	her	husband	discussed	the	incident.	They	even	prayed	at
church	for	the	recovery	of	Sean	King,	and	were	saddened	by	his	death.	She	would
have	a	difficult	time	keeping	an	open	mind.	The	more	she	is	quizzed,	the	more	she
realizes	how	firmly	she	believes	Tadeo	is	guilty.	“He	killed	him,”	she	says.
Mancini	 asks	 a	 few	 of	 the	 same	 questions.	 I	 take	 my	 turn	 but	 do	 not	 waste

time.	 Liza	 will	 get	 the	 boot	 soon	 enough.	 For	 now,	 though,	 she	 is	 instructed	 to
return	to	her	seat	on	row	one	and	not	say	a	word.
Juror	 number	 eleven	 is	 the	 mother	 of	 two	 teenage	 boys,	 both	 of	 whom	 love
cage	 fighting	 and	 have	 spent	 hours	 discussing	 Tadeo	 and	 Sean	 King.	 She	 hasn’t
watched	 the	 video,	 though	 her	 boys	 begged	 her	 to.	 She	 does,	 however,	 know	 all
about	the	case	and	admits	to	having	plenty	of	preconceived	notions.	Mancini	and	I
politely	poke	and	prod	but	get	nothing.	She,	too,	will	be	excused.
The	 afternoon	 grinds	 on	 as	 we	 work	 through	 the	 twenty-two	 jurors,	 all	 of
whom,	it	turns	out,	know	far	more	than	they	should.	A	couple	claim	they	can	set
aside	their	initial	opinions	and	decide	the	case	with	open	minds.	I	doubt	this,	but
then	 I	 am	 the	 defense	 lawyer.	 Late	 in	 the	 day,	 after	 we	 have	 finished	 with	 the
twenty-two,	 I	 renew	 my	 motion	 for	 a	 change	 of	 venue.	 Armed	 with	 fresh	 and
irrefutable	evidence,	I	argue	that	we’ve	just	seen	clear	proof	that	too	many	people
in	this	city	know	far	too	much	about	the	case.
Go	Slow	listens	and	acts	as	though	she	believes	me,	which	I	think	she	does.
“I’ll	 overrule	 your	 motion	 for	 now,	 Mr.	 Rudd.	 Let’s	 proceed	 and	 see	 what
tomorrow	brings.”

9.
After	court,	Partner	drives	me	to	the	warehouse	where	Harry	&	Harry	conduct
their	operations.	I	meet	with	Harry	Gross	and	we	review	Judith’s	latest	petition.
He’ll	prepare	a	response,	one	similar	to	the	other	three	already	on	file,	and	I’ll	sign
and	file	it	tomorrow.
Partner	 and	 I	 go	 to	 the	 basement,	 where	 Cliff	 and	 his	 team	 are	 already	 at
work.	From	the	first	four	rows	of	the	pool,	numbers	one	through	forty,	nine	people
were	quizzed	privately	during	the	afternoon	session.	I	expect	all	nine	to	be	excused
for	cause,	or	for	good	reason.	Each	side	has	four	challenges,	four	automatic	hooks
that	can	be	used	for	no	reason	whatsoever.	That’s	a	total	of	eight.	There	is	no	limit
on	 the	 number	 who	 can	 be	 excused	 for	 cause.	 The	 trick,	 the	 skill,	 the	 art,	 is
reading	 the	 jurors	 and	 trying	 to	 determine	 which	 to	 challenge.	 I	 get	 only	 four
strikes,	 same	 as	 the	 prosecution,	 and	 one	 mistake	 can	 be	 fatal.	 Not	 only	 do	 I
decide	 whom	 to	 keep	 and	 whom	 to	 strike,	 but	 I	 also	 play	 chess	 with	 Mancini.
Whom	will	he	get	rid	of?	Certainly	the	Hispanics.
I	do	not	expect	an	acquittal,	so	I’m	angling	for	a	hung	jury.	I	have	to	find	the
one	or	two	jurors	who	might	show	some	sympathy.
For	 hours,	 over	 bad	 carryout	 sushi	 and	 bottles	 of	 green	 tea,	 we	 dissect	 each
potential	juror.

10.
There	 are	 no	 phone	 calls	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night;	 nothing	 from	 Arch
Swanger,	nor	Nate	Spurio.	Not	a	word	from	Moss	Korgan.	Evidently,	my	brilliant
offer	of	a	deal	didn’t	get	very	far.	As	the	sun	rises,	I’m	at	my	computer	responding
to	e-mails.	I	decide	to	send	one	to	Judith.	It	reads,	“Why	can’t	you	stop	the	war?
You’ve	lost	so	many	battles	and	you’ll	lose	this	one.	The	only	thing	you’ll	prove	is
how	 ridiculously	 stubborn	 you	 are.	 Think	 about	 Starcher,	 not	 yourself.”	 The
response	will	be	predictably	harsh	and	well	crafted.
Partner	drops	me	off	in	a	strip	mall	out	in	the	suburbs.	The	only	store	open	is
a	 bagel	 shop	 where	 smoking	 is	 illegally	 permitted.	 The	 owner	 is	 an	 old	 Greek
who’s	 dying	 of	 lung	 cancer.	 His	 nephew	 has	 rank	 at	 City	 Hall	 and	 health
inspectors	 don’t	 bother	 the	 place.	 It	 features	 strong	 coffee,	 real	 yogurt,	 decent
bagels,	and	a	layer	of	rich,	blue	cigarette	smoke	that’s	a	throwback	to	the	days	not
long	ago	when	it	was	common	to	eat	in	a	restaurant	while	inhaling	the	fumes	and
vapors	of	those	close	by.	Nowadays,	it’s	still	hard	to	believe	we	tolerated	that.	Nate
Spurio	goes	through	two	packs	a	day	and	loves	this	place.	I	take	a	deep	breath	out
front,	fill	my	lungs	with	clear	air,	walk	inside,	and	see	Nate	at	a	table,	coffee	and
newspaper	in	front	of	him,	a	fresh	Salem	screwed	into	the	corner	of	his	mouth.	He
waves	at	a	chair	and	puts	the	paper	away.	“You	want	coffee?”	he	asks.
“No	thanks.	I’ve	had	enough.”
“How	are	things	going?”
“You	mean	life	in	general	or	the	Zapate	trial?”
He	grunts,	tries	to	smile.	“Since	when	do	we	talk	about	life	in	general?”
“Good	 point.	 Nothing	 from	 Mancini.	 If	 he’s	 in	 on	 the	 deal,	 he	 damned	 sure
doesn’t	act	like	it.	Still	offering	fifteen	years.”
“They’re	working	on	him,	but,	as	you	know,	he’s	a	prick	who’s	going	places.
Right	now	he’s	onstage	and	that	means	a	lot	to	him.”
“So	Roy	Kemp	is	hammering	away?”
“You	could	say	that.	He’s	tightening	every	screw	he	can	find.	He’s	desperate—
can’t	 say	 I	 blame	 him.	 And	 he	 hates	 you	 because	 he	 thinks	 you’re	 withholding
information.”
“Gee,	 I’m	 sorry.	 Tell	 him	 I	 hate	 him	 too	 because	 he	 kidnapped	 my	 kid,	 but
nothing	personal.	If	he’ll	get	to	the	mayor,	who	can	then	get	to	Mancini,	we	might
have	us	a	deal.”
“It’s	in	the	works,	okay.	Things	are	moving.”
“Well,	things	need	to	move	faster.	We’re	picking	a	jury	and	based	on	what	I’ve

seen	and	heard	so	far	my	guy	is	in	deep	trouble.”
“That’s	what	I	hear.”
“Thanks.	 We’ll	 probably	 start	 calling	 witnesses	 tomorrow	 and	 there	 aren’t
many	of	them.	This	could	be	over	by	Friday.	We	need	to	cut	the	deal	quickly.	Five
years,	county	penal	farm,	early	parole.	Got	it,	Nate?	Does	everybody	up	the	food
chain	understand	the	terms	of	the	deal?”
“Plain	as	day.	It’s	not	that	complicated.”
“Then	 tell	 them	 to	 make	 it	 happen.	 My	 guy	 is	 about	 to	 get	 slammed	 by	 this
jury.”
He	pulls	on	the	cigarette,	fills	his	lungs,	asks,	“Are	you	around	tonight?”
“You	think	I’m	leaving	town?”
“We	should	probably	talk.”
“Sure,	but	now	I	gotta	run.	I	have	this	trial	today	and	we’re	out	here	beating
the	bushes	looking	for	some	jurors	to	bribe.”
“I	didn’t	hear	a	word,	and	I’m	certainly	not	surprised.”
“See	you,	Nate.”
“A	real	pleasure.”
“And	you	really	should	stop	smoking.”
“Just	take	care	of	yourself,	okay.	You	got	your	own	problems.”

11.
Go	Slow	is	late	for	court,	which,	on	the	one	hand,	is	not	that	unusual	because
she	 is	 a	 judge	 and	 the	 party	 doesn’t	 start	 until	 she	 arrives.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,
though,	this	is	a	high-water	mark	for	her	career	and	you’d	think	she	would	arrive
early	 and	 savor	 the	 moment.	 But	 I	 learned	 a	 long	 time	 ago	 not	 to	 waste	 time
analyzing	why	judges	do	the	things	they	do.
Everyone	 has	 been	 waiting	 for	 at	 least	 an	 hour,	 with	 no	 word	 on	 what’s
causing	the	delay,	when	her	courtroom	deputy	snaps	to	attention	and	calls	us	to
order.	Her	Honor	sweeps	onto	the	bench	as	if	she’s	already	terribly	burdened	and
tells	everybody	to	sit	down.	No	apology,	no	explanation.	She	launches	into	some
introductory	 remarks,	 not	 a	 single	 word	 of	 which	 is	 even	 remotely	 original,	 and
when	she	runs	out	of	gas	she	says,	“Mr.	Mancini,	you	may	examine	the	panel	for
the	State.”
Max	is	quickly	on	his	feet,	strutting	along	the	mahogany	railing	that	separates
us	from	the	spectators.	With	ninety-two	jurors	on	one	side,	and	at	least	that	many
reporters	and	spectators	on	the	other,	the	courtroom	is	again	packed.	They’re	even
leaning	against	the	rear	wall.	Max	rarely	has	such	an	audience.	He	begins	with	a
dreadful,	 sappy	 monologue	 about	 how	 honored	 he	 feels	 to	 just	 be	 in	 the
courtroom	representing	the	good	people	of	our	city.	He	feels	a	burden.	He	feels	an
honor.	He	feels	an	obligation.	He	feels	a	lot	of	things,	and	within	a	few	minutes	I
notice	some	of	the	jurors	start	to	frown	and	look	at	him	as	if	to	say,	“Is	this	guy
serious?”
After	he’s	talked	about	himself	for	too	long,	I	slowly	stand,	look	at	Her	Honor,
and	say,	“Judge,	can	we	please	get	on	with	this?”
She	says,	“Mr.	Mancini,	do	you	have	some	questions	for	the	pool?”
He	replies,	“Of	course,	Your	Honor.	I	didn’t	realize	we	were	in	such	a	hurry.”
“Oh,	 there’s	 no	 hurry,	 but	 I	 really	 don’t	 want	 to	 waste	 time.”	 This,	 from	 a
judge	who	was	an	hour	late.
Max	begins	with	textbook	questions	about	prior	jury	service,	and	experiences
with	 the	 criminal	 justice	 system,	 and	 prejudices	 against	 the	 police	 and	 law
enforcement.	By	and	large,	it’s	a	waste	of	time	because	people	rarely	reveal	their
true	feelings	in	such	a	setting.	It	does,	however,	give	us	plenty	of	time	to	study	the
jurors.	Tadeo	is	taking	pages	of	notes,	at	my	direction.	I’m	scribbling	too,	but	I’m
primarily	watching	body	language.	Cliff	and	his	associate	are	on	the	pews	across
the	aisle,	watching	everything.	By	now,	I	feel	as	though	I’ve	known	these	people,
especially	the	first	forty,	for	years.
Max	wants	to	know	if	any	of	them	have	ever	been	sued.	A	standard	question
but	not	a	great	one.	This	is,	after	all,	a	criminal	matter,	not	a	civil	one.	Out	of	the

ninety-two,	about	fifteen	admit	to	being	sued	at	some	point	in	their	past.	I’ll	bet
there	 are	 at	 least	 another	 fifteen	 who	 are	 not	 admitting	 it.	 This	 is,	 after	 all,
America.	What	honest	citizen	has	never	been	sued?	Max	seems	thrilled	with	this
response,	as	if	he’s	really	found	fertile	dirt	to	dig	in.	He	asks	if	their	experiences
within	the	court	system	would	in	any	way	affect	their	ability	to	deliberate	in	this
case.
Naw,	 Max.	 Everybody	 loves	 to	 get	 sued.	 And	 we	 do	 so	 without	 the	 slightest
resentment	toward	the	system.	But	he	flails	away	with	follow-up	questions	that	go
nowhere.
For	 nothing	 but	 spite,	 I	 stand	 and	 say,	 “Your	 Honor,	 could	 you	 remind	 Mr.
Mancini	that	this	is	a	criminal	case,	not	a	civil	one?”
“I	know	that!”	Max	growls	at	me	and	we	exchange	nasty	looks.	“I	know	what
I’m	doing.”
“Move	along,	Mr.	Mancini,”	Her	Honor	says.	“And	please	keep	your	seat,	Mr.
Rudd.”
Max	 fights	 his	 anger	 and	 lets	 it	 pass.	 Changing	 gears,	 he	 wades	 into	 a
sensitive	 matter.	 Has	 anyone	 in	 your	 immediate	 family	 ever	 been	 convicted	 of	 a
violent	crime?	He	apologizes	for	intruding	into	such	a	private	matter,	but	he	has
no	 choice.	 Please	 forgive	 him.	 From	 the	 rear,	 juror	 number	 eighty-one	 slowly
raises	a	hand.
Mrs.	Emma	Huffinghouse.	White,	age	fifty-six,	a	freight	company	dispatcher.
Her	 twenty-seven-year-old	 son	 is	 serving	 twelve	 years	 for	 a	 drug-fueled	 home
invasion.	As	soon	as	Max	sees	her	hand	he	throws	up	his	and	pleads,	“I	don’t	want
the	details,	please.	I	know	this	is	a	very	private	matter	and	very	hurtful,	I’m	sure.
My	 question	 is	 this:	 Was	 your	 experience	 with	 the	 criminal	 justice	 system
satisfactory	or	unsatisfactory?”
Seriously,	Max?	We’re	not	filling	out	a	survey	for	consumer	satisfaction.
Mrs.	Huffinghouse	stands	slowly	and	says,	“I	think	my	son	was	treated	fairly
by	the	system.”
Max	 almost	 leaps	 over	 the	 bar	 to	 run	 hug	 her.	 Bless	 you,	 dear,	 bless	 you.
What	 an	 endorsement	 for	 the	 forces	 of	 good!	 Too	 bad,	 Max,	 she’s	 useless.	 We
won’t	get	close	to	number	eighty-one.
Juror	number	forty-seven	raises	his	hand,	stands,	says	his	brother	spent	time
in	jail	for	aggravated	assault,	and,	unlike	Mrs.	Huffinghouse,	he,	Mark	Wattburg,
was	not	favorably	impressed	with	the	criminal	process.
But	Max	thanks	him	profusely	anyway.	Anybody	else?	No	more	hands.	There
are	three	others,	and	I	suppose	I	know	it	but	Max	doesn’t.	This	confirms	that	my
research	 is	 better	 than	 his.	 It	 also	 alerts	 me	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 these	 three	 are	 not
altogether	forthcoming.

Max	moves	on	as	the	morning	drags.	He	steps	into	another	delicate	minefield,
that	of	victimhood.	Have	any	of	you	been	the	victim	of	a	violent	crime?	You,	your
family	 members,	 close	 friends?	 Several	 hands	 go	 up	 and	 Max	 does	 a	 nice	 job	 of
eliciting	information	that’s	useful,	for	a	change.
At	 noon,	 Her	 Honor,	 no	 doubt	 exhausted	 by	 two	 hours	 on	 the	 bench	 and
probably	 craving	 apple	 slices,	 announces	 a	 ninety-minute	 break.	 Tadeo	 wants	 to
stay	 in	 the	 courtroom	 for	 lunch.	 I	 make	 a	 pleasant	 request	 to	 his	 handler,	 who
agrees,	to	our	surprise.	Partner	hustles	down	the	street	to	a	deli	and	returns	with
sandwiches	and	chips.
As	we	eat,	we	talk	softly,	keeping	our	voices	low	so	the	deputies	and	bailiffs
cannot	hear	us.	There	is	no	one	else	in	the	courtroom.	The	gravity	of	the	setting
and	 surroundings	 has	 settled	 in	 and	 Tadeo	 has	 lost	 some	 of	 his	 cockiness.	 He’s
absorbed	 the	 unforgiving	 stares	 from	 those	 who	 might	 be	 called	 upon	 to	 judge
him.	He	no	longer	believes	that	they	are	his	peers.	Softly,	he	says,	“I	get	the	feeling
they	don’t	like	me.”
Such	a	perceptive	young	man.

12.
Max	finishes	up	around	three	and	hands	off	to	me.	By	now,	I	know	more	than
enough	 about	 these	 people	 and	 I’m	 ready	 for	 the	 selection.	 However,	 this	 is	 my
first	 chance	 to	 speak	 directly	 to	 the	 pool,	 and	 it’s	 an	 opportunity	 to	 lay	 the
groundwork	 for	 what	 every	 lawyer	 hopes	 will	 become	 some	 level	 of	 trust.	 I
watched	their	faces	and	I	know	many	of	them	found	Max	to	be	obsequious,	even	a
bit	goofy.	I	have	an	abundance	of	flaws	and	bad	habits,	but	fawning	is	not	part	of
my	 act.	 I	 don’t	 thank	 them	 for	 being	 there—they	 were	 summoned,	 they	 have	 no
choice.	I	don’t	pretend	that	we’re	doing	something	great	and	they’re	a	part	of	it.	I
don’t	brag	on	our	judicial	system.
Instead,	 I	 talk	 in	 broad	 terms	 about	 the	 presumption	 of	 innocence.	 I	 urge
them	to	ask	themselves	if	they	haven’t	already	decided	that	my	client	is	guilty	of
something	or	else	he	wouldn’t	be	here.	Don’t	raise	your	hand,	just	nod	along	with
me	if	you	think	he’s	guilty.	It’s	human	nature.	It’s	the	way	our	society	and	culture
work	these	days.	There’s	a	crime,	an	arrest,	we	see	the	suspect	on	television,	and
we’re	relieved	that	the	police	have	caught	their	man.	Presto,	just	like	that.	Crime
solved.	 Guilty	 party	 in	 custody.	 These	 days	 we	 never,	 never	 stop	 and	 say,	 “Wait,
he’s	 presumed	 to	 be	 innocent	 and	 he’s	 entitled	 to	 a	 fair	 trial.”	 We	 rush	 to
judgment.
“Questions,	Mr.	Rudd?”	Go	Slow	squawks	into	her	microphone.
I	 ignore	 her,	 point	 to	 Tadeo,	 and	 ask	 if	 they	 can	 truthfully	 say	 that,	 at	 this
moment,	they	believe	he’s	completely	innocent.
Of	 course,	 there	 is	 no	 response	 because	 no	 prospective	 juror	 will	 ever	 say
she’s	made	up	her	mind	already.
I	move	on	to	the	burden	of	proof	and	discuss	it	until	Max	has	had	enough.	He
stands,	arms	open	wide	in	complete	frustration,	and	says,	“Your	Honor,	he’s	not
quizzing	the	panel.	He’s	giving	a	law	school	lecture.”
“Agreed.	 Either	 ask	 your	 questions	 or	 sit	 down,	 Mr.	 Rudd,”	 Go	 Slow	 says,
rather	rudely.
“Thank	 you,”	 I	 reply	 like	 the	 smart-ass	 I	 really	 am.	 I	 look	 at	 the	 first	 three
rows	 and	 say,	 “Tadeo	 doesn’t	 have	 to	 testify,	 doesn’t	 have	 to	 call	 any	 witnesses.
Why?	 Because	 the	 burden	 of	 proving	 him	 guilty	 lies	 with	 the	 prosecution.	 Now,
let’s	say	he	doesn’t	take	the	stand.	Will	that	matter	to	you?	Will	you	tend	to	think
he’s	hiding	something?”
I	use	this	all	the	time	and	rarely	get	a	response.	Today,	though,	juror	number
seventeen	 wants	 to	 say	 something.	 Bobby	 Morris,	 age	 thirty-six,	 white,	 a
stonemason.	 He	 raises	 his	 hand	 and	 I	 nod	 at	 him.	 He	 says,	 “If	 I’m	 on	 the	 jury,
then	I	think	he	should	testify.	I	want	to	hear	from	the	defendant.”

“Thank	 you,	 Mr.	 Morris,”	 I	 reply	 warmly.	 “Anybody	 else?”	 With	 the	 ice
broken,	several	others	raise	their	hands	and	I	gently	ask	follow-up	questions.	As	I
had	hoped,	it	becomes	a	discussion	as	more	and	more	lose	their	inhibitions.	I’m
easy	to	talk	to,	a	nice	guy,	a	straight	shooter	with	a	sense	of	humor.
When	I’m	finished,	Her	Honor	informs	us	we	will	pick	the	jury	before	we	go
home	and	gives	us	fifteen	minutes	to	look	at	our	notes.

13.
The	e-mail	from	Judith	reads,	“Starcher	is	still	upset.	You	are	such	a	pathetic
father.	See	you	in	court.”
I’m	tempted	to	fire	something	back,	but	why	bother?	Partner	and	I	are	driving
away	from	the	courthouse.	It’s	dark,	after	7:00	p.m.,	and	it’s	been	a	hard	day.	We
stop	at	a	bar	for	a	beer	and	a	sandwich.
Nine	whites,	one	black,	one	Hispanic,	one	Vietnamese.	With	their	names	and
faces	so	fresh	I	have	to	talk	about	them.	Partner,	as	always,	listens	dutifully	with
little	comment.	He	has	been	in	the	courtroom	for	most	of	the	past	two	days	and	he
likes	the	jury.
I	stop	at	two	beers,	though	I	really	want	several	more.	At	nine	o’clock,	Partner
drops	me	off	at	an	Arby’s,	and	I	fiddle	with	a	soft	drink	for	fifteen	minutes	waiting
on	 Nate.	 He	 finally	 arrives,	 orders	 some	 onion	 rings,	 apologizes	 for	 being	 tardy.
“How’s	the	trial	going?”	he	asks.
“Got	 a	 jury	 late	 this	 afternoon.	 Opening	 statements	 in	 the	 morning,	 then
Mancini	starts	calling	witnesses.	Should	go	pretty	fast.	We	got	a	deal?”
He	 shovels	 in	 a	 large,	 crusty	 ring	 and	 chews	 fiercely	 while	 looking	 around.
The	 place	 is	 empty.	 He	 swallows	 hard,	 says,	 “Yep.	 Woody	 met	 with	 Mancini	 two
hours	ago	and	fired	him.	He	replaced	him	with	a	flunky	who	was	planning	to	move
for	a	mistrial	first	thing	in	the	morning.	Mancini	backed	down	and	agreed	to	play
along.	He	wants	to	meet	with	you	and	the	judge	at	8:30	tomorrow.”
“The	judge?”
“You	 got	 it.	 Seems	 Woody	 and	 Janet	 Fabineau	 have	 some	 mutual	 dealings,
friends,	whatever,	and	Woody	insisted	on	putting	her	in	the	loop.	She’s	good	to	go.
She’ll	 take	 the	 plea,	 approve	 the	 bargain,	 sentence	 your	 boy	 to	 five	 years	 at	 the
penal	farm,	recommend	early	release.	Just	like	you	said,	Rudd.”
“Marvelous.	And	Link’s	thugs?”
“That	investigation	is	going	nowhere.	Forget	about	it.”	He	sucks	on	his	straw
and	selects	another	onion	ring.	“Now,	Rudd,	the	fun	part.”
“The	 last	 time	 I	 saw	 Swanger,	 the	 meeting	 was	 arranged	 through	 a	 prepaid
cell	 phone	 he	 left	 behind	 for	 me	 in	 a	 pharmacy.	 I	 still	 have	 the	 phone.	 It’s	 right
outside	in	my	van.	I	haven’t	used	it	since,	so	I	don’t	know	if	it’ll	work.	But	if	I	get
Swanger	on	the	phone	I’ll	try	to	set	up	a	meeting.	I’ll	have	to	give	him	some	cash.”
“How	much?”
“Fifty	grand,	unmarked.	He’s	not	stupid.”
“Fifty	grand?”

“That’s	about	a	third	of	the	reward	money.	I’m	assuming	he’ll	grab	it	because
he’s	 broke.	 Anything	 less	 might	 cause	 problems.	 Last	 year	 you	 guys	 cashed	 in
forfeited	assets	to	the	tune	of	four	million	bucks,	all	retained	by	the	department,
pursuant	to	our	brilliant	state	law.	The	money’s	there,	Nate,	and	Roy	Kemp	would
spend	anything	for	the	chance	to	see	his	daughter	again.”
“Okay,	okay.	I’ll	pass	it	along.	That’s	all	I	can	do.”
I	leave	him	with	his	onion	rings	and	hurry	to	the	van.	As	Partner	drives	away,
I	open	the	cheap	phone	and	call	the	number.	Nothing.	An	hour	later,	I	call	again.
And	again.	Nothing.

14.
Aided	 by	 exhaustion,	 the	 two	 beers,	 and	 a	 couple	 of	 whiskey	 sours,	 I	 fall
asleep	with	the	television	on.	I	wake	up	in	my	recliner,	still	wearing	a	suit	but	no
tie,	 socks	 but	 no	 shoes.	 My	 cell	 phone	 is	 ringing;	 caller	 ID	 says	 “Unknown.”	 It’s
1:40	a.m.	I	take	a	chance	and	say	hello.
“You	looking	for	me?”	Swanger	asks.
“Yes,	as	a	matter	of	fact,”	I	say,	collapsing	the	footrest	and	bolting	to	my	feet.
Things	are	foggy	and	my	brain	needs	blood.	“Where	are	you?”
“Dumb	question.	Any	more	stupidity	and	I’m	hanging	up.”
“Look,	 Arch,	 there	 could	 be	 a	 deal	 in	 the	 works.	 That	 is	 if	 you’re	 telling	 the
truth,	which,	frankly,	no	one	involved	believes	you’re	capable	of.”
“I	didn’t	call	to	get	insulted.”
“Of	 course	 not.	 You	 called	 because	 you	 want	 money.	 I	 think	 I	 can	 broker	 a
deal,	act	as	the	middleman,	without	a	fee	of	course.	I’m	not	your	lawyer,	so	I	won’t
be	sending	you	a	bill.”
“Very	funny.	You’re	not	my	lawyer	because	you	can’t	be	trusted,	Rudd.”
“Okay,	next	time	you	snatch	a	girl,	hire	somebody	else.	You	want	the	money
or	not,	Arch?	I	really	don’t	care.”
There	 is	 a	 brief	 pause	 as	 he	 thinks	 about	 how	 much	 he	 needs	 cash.	 Finally,
“How	much?”
“Twenty-five	thousand	now	to	tell	us	where	the	girl	is.	If	they	find	her,	then
twenty-five	more.”
“That’s	only	a	third	of	the	reward	money.	You	taking	the	rest?”
“Not	 a	 dime.	 As	 I	 said,	 I’m	 getting	 nothing,	 and	 that’s	 the	 very	 reason	 I’m
asking	myself	what	the	hell	I’m	doing	in	the	middle	of	all	this.”
Another	pause	as	he	contemplates	a	counteroffer.	“I	don’t	like	the	deal,	Rudd.
I’ll	never	see	the	other	twenty-five.”
And	we’ll	never	see	the	girl,	I	think	but	don’t	say.	“Look,	Arch,	you’re	getting
twenty-five	 thousand	 bucks	 from	 the	 very	 people	 who	 would	 shoot	 you	 on	 sight.
That’s	a	lot	more	than	you	made	last	year	with	honest	work.”
“I	don’t	believe	in	honest	work.	Neither	do	you.	That’s	why	you’re	a	lawyer.”
“Ha-ha.	You’re	clever.	You	want	a	deal,	Swanger?	If	not,	I’m	butting	out.	I	got
more	important	things	on	my	mind	these	days.”
“Fifty	grand,	Rudd.	Cash.	Fifty	grand	and	I’ll	tell	you	and	you	alone	where	the

girl	 is	 right	 now.	 If	 this	 is	 a	 setup	 or	 if	 I	 smell	 a	 cop	 anywhere	 around,	 I’ll	 bolt,
make	a	call,	and	the	girl	will	be	gone	for	good.	Understand?”
“I	got	it.	I’m	not	sure	about	the	money,	but	all	I	can	do	is	pass	this	along	to	my
contact.”
“Work	fast,	Rudd,	my	patience	is	running	thin.”
“Oh,	 you’ll	 find	 the	 time	 if	 the	 money’s	 on	 the	 table.	 Who	 are	 you	 kidding,
Swanger?”
The	line	goes	dead.	So	much	for	a	good	night’s	sleep.

15.
Three	hours	later,	I	stop	at	an	all-night	convenience	store	and	buy	a	bottle	of
water.	Outside,	I’m	approached	by	a	cop	in	plain	clothes	who	grunts,	“You	Rudd?”
Since	I	am,	he	hands	me	a	brown	paper	grocery	bag	with	a	cigar	box	inside.	“Fifty
grand,”	he	says.	“All	in	hundreds.”
“That’ll	do,”	I	say.	What	am	I	supposed	to	say?	“Thanks”?
I	 leave	 the	 City,	 alone.	 During	 my	 last	 conversation	 with	 Swanger,	 about	 an
hour	ago,	he	instructed	me	to	ditch	my	“thug”	and	do	the	driving	myself.	He	also
told	me	to	forget	the	fancy	new	van	and	drive	something	else.	I	explained	that,	at
the	moment,	I	had	nothing	else	and	didn’t	have	time	to	run	get	a	rental.	The	van
will	have	to	do.
I	 try	 not	 to	 dwell	 on	 the	 fact	 that	 this	 guy	 is	 watching	 me.	 He	 knew	 the
moment	 Partner	 and	 I	 began	 buzzing	 around	 in	 a	 U-Haul	 van.	 Now	 he	 knows	 I
have	 new	 wheels.	 It’s	 astonishing	 that	 he’s	 in	 the	 City	 enough	 to	 know	 these
things,	yet	still	undiscovered	by	the	police.	I	suspect	he’ll	finally	disappear	when
he	gets	the	money,	which	will	not	be	a	bad	thing.
As	 instructed,	 I	 call	 him	 as	 I	 leave	 the	 City	 on	 the	 southern	 bypass	 of	 the
interstate.	 His	 directions	 are	 precise:	 “Go	 sixteen	 miles	 south	 to	 exit	 184,	 take
Route	63	east	to	the	town	of	Jobes.”	As	I	drive,	I	remind	myself	that	I	have	this
trial	that’s	supposed	to	kick	off	in	just	a	few	hours,	or	is	it?	If	Judge	Fabineau	is
really	in	the	loop,	what	does	that	mean	for	the	rest	of	the	day?
I	have	no	idea	how	much	surveillance	is	tracking	me	right	now,	but	I’m	sure	it
is	 substantial.	 I	 didn’t	 ask	 questions,	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to,	 but	 I	 know	 Roy	 Kemp
and	his	team	have	called	in	all	the	bloodhounds.	There	are	two	mikes	in	my	van
and	a	tracking	device	inside	the	rear	bumper.	I’ve	allowed	them	to	listen	to	my	cell
phone,	but	just	for	the	next	few	hours.	I’ll	bet	they	already	have	people	closing	in
on	 the	 town	 of	 Jobes.	 A	 helicopter	 or	 two	 in	 the	 air	 above	 me	 would	 not	 be	 a
surprise.	I’m	not	frightened—Swanger	has	no	reason	to	harm	me—but	my	nerves
are	jumping	nonetheless.
The	 money	 is	 unmarked	 and	 cannot	 be	 traced.	 The	 police	 don’t	 care	 if	 they
get	it	back;	they	just	want	the	girl.	They’re	also	assuming	Swanger	is	smart	enough
to	spot	anything	fishy.
Jobes	 is	 a	 small	 town	 of	 three	 thousand.	 When	 I	 pass	 a	 Shell	 station	 on	 the
edge	 of	 town,	 I	 call	 Swanger,	 as	 instructed.	 He	 says,	 “Stay	 on	 the	 line.	 Turn	 left
just	past	the	car	wash.”	I	turn	left	onto	a	dark,	paved	street	with	a	few	old	houses
on	both	sides.	He	says,	“You	swear	you	got	fifty	grand,	Rudd?”
“I	do.”

“Take	a	right	and	go	over	the	railroad	tracks.”	I	do	as	I’m	told,	and	he	says,
“Now	 turn	 right	 onto	 that	 first	 street.	 It	 has	 no	 name.	 Stop	 at	 the	 first	 stop	 sign
and	wait.”
When	 I	 stop,	 a	 figure	 suddenly	 appears	 from	 the	 darkness	 and	 yanks	 the
passenger	door	handle.	I	press	the	button	to	unlock	it	and	Swanger	jumps	inside.
He	 points	 left,	 says,	 “Go	 that	 way	 and	 take	 your	 time.	 We’re	 headed	 back	 to	 the
interstate.”
“Great	 to	 see	 you	 again,	 Arch.”	 He’s	 wearing	 a	 black	 do-rag	 that	 covers	 his
eyebrows	 and	 ears.	 Everything	 else	 is	 black	 too,	 from	 the	 bandanna	 around	 his
neck	to	his	combat	boots.	I	almost	ask	him	where	he	parked,	but	why	bother?
“Where’s	the	money?”	he	demands.
I	 nod	 over	 my	 shoulder	 and	 he	 grabs	 the	 bag.	 He	 opens	 the	 cigar	 box,	 and
with	a	small	key-chain	light	counts	the	money.	He	looks	up,	says,	“Take	a	right,”
then	keeps	counting.	As	we	are	leaving	the	town,	he	takes	a	deep,	satisfied	breath,
and	offers	me	a	goofy	grin.	“All	here,”	he	says.
“You	doubt	me?”
“Damned	 right	 I	 doubt	 you,	 Rudd.”	 He	 points	 to	 the	 Shell	 station	 and	 says,
“You	want	a	beer?”
“No.	I	don’t	normally	drink	beer	at	five-thirty	in	the	morning.”
“It’s	the	best	time.	Pull	in.”
He	goes	inside	without	the	money.	He	takes	his	time,	selects	a	bag	of	chips	to
go	 with	 his	 six-pack,	 and	 strolls	 back	 to	 the	 van	 as	 if	 he	 has	 no	 concerns
whatsoever.	 When	 we’re	 moving	 again,	 he	 rips	 off	 a	 can	 and	 pops	 the	 top.	 He
slurps	it	and	opens	the	chips.
“Where	are	we	going,	Arch?”	I	ask	with	no	small	amount	of	irritation.
“Get	 on	 the	 interstate	 and	 head	 south.	 This	 van	 still	 smells	 new,	 you	 know
that,	 Rudd?	 I	 think	 I	 liked	 the	 old	 one	 better.”	 He	 crunches	 a	 mouthful	 of	 chips
and	washes	it	all	down	with	a	gulp	of	beer.
“Too	 bad.	 Don’t	 spill	 any	 crumbs,	 okay?	 Partner	 gets	 really	 pissed	 off	 if	 he
finds	crumbs	in	the	van.”
“That	your	thug?”
“You	know	who	it	is.”	We’re	on	Route	63,	still	dark	and	deserted.	No	sign	of
sunrise.	 I	 keep	 glancing	 around	 thinking	 I’ll	 see	 some	 of	 the	 surveillance,	 but	 of
course	they’re	too	good	for	that.	They’re	back	there,	or	up	there,	or	waiting	at	the
interstate.	Then	again,	what	do	I	know	about	such	things?	I’m	a	lawyer.
He	pulls	a	small	phone	out	of	his	shirt	pocket	and	holds	it	up	for	me	to	see.
He	says,	“Know	one	thing,	Rudd.	If	I	see	a	cop,	smell	a	cop,	or	hear	a	cop,	all	I	do
is	push	this	button	on	this	phone,	and	somewhere,	far	away,	bad	things	happen.

You	understand?”
“Got	 it.	 Now,	 where,	 Arch?	 That’s	 the	 first	 thing.	 Where,	 when,	 how?	 You
have	the	money;	now	you	owe	us	the	story.	Where	is	the	girl	and	how	do	we	get
her?”
He	 drains	 the	 first	 can,	 smacks	 his	 lips,	 reloads	 another	 mouthful	 of	 chips,
and	for	a	few	miles	it	seems	as	though	he	has	gone	mute.	Then	he	opens	another
beer.	At	the	intersection,	he	says,	“Go	south.”
Traffic	 in	 the	 northbound	 lane	 is	 busy	 as	 the	 early	 commuters	 head	 for	 the
City.	 The	 southbound,	 though,	 is	 practically	 deserted.	 I	 look	 at	 him	 and	 want	 to
slap	the	smirk	off	his	face.	“Arch?”
He	takes	another	drink	and	sits	taller.	“They’ve	taken	the	girls	from	Chicago
to	Atlanta.	They	move	around	a	lot,	every	four	or	five	months.	They’ll	work	a	town
pretty	 hard,	 but	 then	 after	 a	 while	 people	 start	 talking,	 the	 cops	 start	 sniffing
around,	 and	 so	 they	 disappear,	 set	 up	 shop	 somewhere	 else.	 It’s	 hard	 to	 keep
secrets	when	you’re	offering	pretty	young	women	at	good	prices.”
“If	you	say	so.	Is	Jiliana	Kemp	still	alive?”
“Oh	yes.	Very	much	so.	She’s	quite	active,	not	like	she	has	a	choice.”
“And	she’s	in	Atlanta?”
“The	Atlanta	area.”
“It’s	 a	 big	 city,	 Arch,	 and	 we	 don’t	 have	 time	 to	 play	 games.	 If	 you	 have	 an
address,	then	give	it	to	me.	That’s	the	deal.”
He	 takes	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 another	 long	 drink.	 “They’re	 in	 a	 big	 strip	 mall
where	there’s	traffic,	lots	of	cars	and	people	come	and	go.	Atlas	Physical	Therapy
is	the	name	of	the	company,	but	it’s	nothing	but	an	upper-end	brothel.	No	number
in	 the	 phone	 book.	 Therapists	 on	 call.	 Appointments	 only,	 no	 walk-ins.	 Every
customer	has	to	be	referred	by	another	customer,	and	they—the	head	therapists—
know	who	they’re	dealing	with.	So	if	you’re	a	customer,	you	park	in	the	lot,	maybe
step	into	the	Baskin-Robbins	for	an	ice	cream,	stroll	along	the	sidewalk,	then	duck
into	Atlas.	A	guy	wearing	a	white	lab	coat	says	hello	and	acts	real	nice,	but	under
the	coat	is	a	loaded	piece.	He	pretends	to	be	a	therapist,	and	he	does	in	fact	know	a
lot	about	broken	bones.	He	takes	your	money,	say	$300	cash,	and	leads	you	back
to	some	rooms.	He	points	to	one,	you	walk	in,	and	there’s	a	small	bed	and	a	girl
who’s	young	and	pretty	and	almost	naked.	You	get	twenty	minutes	with	her.	You
leave	through	another	door	and	no	one	knows	you’ve	had	your	therapy.	The	girls
work	all	afternoon—they	get	the	mornings	off	because	they’re	up	late—then	they
load	’em	up	and	take	’em	to	the	strip	clubs	where	they	dance	and	do	their	routines.
At	midnight,	they	take	’em	home,	to	a	fairly	nice	apartment	complex	where	they’re
locked	down	for	the	night.”
“Who	is	they?”

“They	are	the	traffickers,	some	extremely	nasty	guys.	A	gang,	a	ring,	a	cartel,	a
disciplined	 band	 of	 criminals,	 most	 with	 ties	 to	 eastern	 Europe,	 but	 some	 local
boys	as	well.	They	abuse	the	girls,	keep	them	terrified	and	confused	and	hooked
on	heroin.	Most	people	in	this	country	don’t	believe	there’s	sex	trafficking	in	their
cities,	 but	 it’s	 there.	 It’s	 everywhere.	 They,	 the	 traffickers,	 prey	 on	 runaways,
homeless	 kids,	 girls	 from	 bad	 families	 looking	 for	 escape.	 It’s	 a	 sick	 business,
Rudd.	Really	sick.”
I	start	to	rebuke	him	and	curse	him,	remind	him	of	his	rather	important	role
in	a	business	he	seems	to	detest,	but	it	would	serve	no	purpose.	Instead,	I	go	along
with	him.	“How	many	girls	now?”
“It’s	hard	to	say.	They	split	’em	up,	move	’em	around.	A	few	have	disappeared
for	good.”
I	don’t	really	want	to	pursue	this.	Only	a	creep	involved	in	the	business	would
know	so	much	about	it.
He	points	and	says,	“Turn	around	at	this	exit	and	go	back	north.”
“Where	are	we	going,	Arch?”
“I’ll	show	you.	Just	hang	on.”
“Okay.	Now	about	that	address.”
“Here’s	 what	 I	 would	 do	 if	 I	 were	 the	 cops,”	 he	 says	 with	 a	 sudden	 voice	 of
authority.	“I’d	watch	the	place,	Atlas,	and	I’d	nab	a	john	when	he	comes	out,	fresh
from	therapy.	He’s	probably	a	local	insurance	agent	who’s	not	getting	any	at	home
and	 he’s	 taken	 a	 shine	 to	 one	 of	 the	 girls—you	 can	 actually	 ask	 for	 your	 favorite
but	 the	 request	 is	 nonbinding;	 they	 got	 their	 rules—or	 maybe	 he’s	 a	 local
ambulance	 chaser	 like	 you,	 Rudd,	 just	 another	 sleazy	 lawyer	 who’s	 hitting	 on
everything	 but	 not	 scoring	 much,	 and	 for	 three	 hundred	 bucks	 he	 gets	 his
therapy.”
“Anyway.”
“Anyway,	 they	 grab	 the	 guy,	 scare	 the	 living	 shit	 out	 of	 him,	 and	 within
minutes	 he’s	 singing	 like	 a	 choirboy.	 He	 tells	 them	 everything,	 especially	 the
layout	of	the	interior.	They	make	him	cry,	then	let	him	go.	They,	the	cops,	already
have	a	warrant.	They	surround	the	place	with	one	of	those	SWAT	squads,	and	it
goes	 down	 beautifully.	 The	 girls	 are	 rescued.	 The	 traffickers	 are	 caught	 redhanded,	and	if	the	cops	do	it	right	they	can	flip	one	of	them	instantly.	If	he	sings,
he’ll	 implicate	 the	 entire	 ring.	 There	 could	 be	 hundreds	 of	 girls	 and	 dozens	 of
goons.	Could	be	huge,	Rudd,	all	because	of	you	and	me.”
“Yeah,	we’re	a	real	team,	Swanger.”
I	take	the	exit	ramp,	cross	over	the	interstate,	and	reenter	it	headed	north.	All
the	 eyes	 watching	 my	 van	 must	 be	 wondering	 what	 the	 hell.	 My	 passenger	 pops
another	 top,	 his	 third.	 The	 chips	 are	 gone	 and	 I’m	 sure	 there	 are	 crumbs	 left

behind.	I	push	it	to	seventy	miles	an	hour	and	say,	“The	address,	Arch.”
“It’s	 in	 the	 suburb	 of	 Vista	 View,	 about	 ten	 miles	 due	 west	 of	 downtown
Atlanta.	The	strip	mall	is	called	West	Ivy.	Atlas	Physical	Therapy	is	next	door	to
Sunny	Boy	Cleaners.	The	girls	will	get	there	around	1:00	p.m.”
“And	Jiliana	Kemp	is	one	of	them?”
“I’ve	already	answered	that,	Rudd.	You	think	I’d	tell	you	all	this	if	she	wasn’t
there.	 But	 the	 cops	 better	 go	 in	 quick.	 These	 people	 can	 roll	 up	 and	 move	 in	 a
matter	of	minutes.”
I	have	what	I	want,	so	I	go	quiet.	For	some	reason	I	say,	“Can	I	have	a	beer?”
For	 a	 second	 he	 looks	 irritated,	 as	 if	 he	 needs	 all	 six	 himself,	 but	 then	 he	 smiles
and	hands	one	over.

16.
A	 few	 miles	 down	 the	 road,	 and	 after	 a	 long,	 pleasant	 stretch	 of	 silence,
Swanger	 nods	 and	 says,	 “There	 it	 is.	 Dr.	 Woo	 and	 his	 billboard	 for	 vasectomy
reversals.	Brings	back	memories,	right,	Rudd?”
“I	spent	a	long	night	there,	watching	them	dig.	Why’d	you	do	that,	Arch?”
“Why	 do	 I	 do	 anything,	 Rudd?	 Why	 did	 I	 grab	 that	 girl?	 And	 mistreat	 her?
And	sell	her?	She’s	not	the	first,	you	know?”
“I	really	don’t	care	at	this	point.	I	just	hope	she’s	the	last.”
He	shakes	his	head	and	says	with	some	sadness,	“No	way.	Pull	over	here	on
the	shoulder.”
I	 hit	 the	 brakes	 and	 the	 van	 rolls	 to	 a	 stop	 under	 the	 bright	 lights	 from	 Dr.
Woo.	Swanger	grabs	the	sackful	of	money,	leaves	the	beer	behind,	and	yanks	the
door	handle.	He	says,	“Tell	those	dumb-ass	cops	they’ll	never	find	me.”	He	jumps
out,	slams	the	door,	and	bounces	down	the	shoulder	into	some	tall	grass,	over	a
fence,	and	under	the	billboard.	The	last	image	is	Swanger	ducking	low	between	the
thick	 posts,	 scrambling	 fast,	 and	 making	 tracks,	 then	 disappearing	 into	 the	 tall
corn.
To	be	safe,	I	drive	half	a	mile	down	the	interstate,	pull	off	again,	and	call	the
cops.	They’ve	listened	to	every	word	spoken	in	the	van	for	the	past	hour,	so	there’s
little	for	me	to	say.	I	do	stress	that	it	would	be	a	mistake	to	try	and	corner	Swanger
until	the	raid	takes	place	in	Atlanta.	They	seem	to	agree.	I	see	no	activity	in	and
around	the	cornfield	by	the	billboard.
As	 I’m	 driving	 back	 to	 the	 City,	 my	 cell	 phone	 buzzes.	 Max	 Mancini.	 I	 say,
“Good	morning.”
“I	just	spoke	with	Judge	Fabineau.	Seems	as	if	she’s	been	stricken	with	severe
food	poisoning.	No	court	today.”
“Gee,	that’s	awful.”
“I	knew	you’d	be	disappointed.	Get	some	sleep	and	we’ll	talk	later.”
“Okay.	Am	I	supposed	to	check	in	with	you?”
“Yes.	And,	Rudd,	nice	work.”
“We’ll	see.”
I	 pick	 up	 Partner	 at	 his	 apartment	 and	 we	 settle	 in	 for	 a	 long	 breakfast	 at	 a
waffle	 place.	 I	 recount	 the	 adventures	 of	 the	 past	 seven	 hours,	 and	 he,	 typically,
listens	without	a	word.	I	need	to	lie	down	and	try	to	sleep,	but	I’m	too	wired.	I	try
to	kill	time	around	the	courthouse,	but	I’m	so	preoccupied	with	the	raid	in	Atlanta

I	can	think	of	nothing	else.
Normally,	I	would	be	frantically	preparing	for	Tadeo’s	trial,	but	now	I	doubt	it
will	take	place.	I’ve	kept	my	end	of	the	bargain,	and	regardless	of	what	happens	to
Jiliana	Kemp,	we	should	have	a	deal.	A	nice	little	plea	bargain	that	will	allow	my
client	to	fight	again,	and	soon.	But	I	trust	no	one	I’m	dealing	with	at	the	moment.
If	the	raid	produces	nothing,	it	would	not	be	a	surprise	if	the	mayor,	Max	Mancini,
Moss	 Korgan,	 Go	 Slow	 Fabineau,	 and	 the	 police	 brass	 all	 get	 together	 in	 a	 room
and	decide,	“Screw	Rudd	and	his	client!	Let’s	go	to	trial.”

17.
By	2:00	p.m.	eastern	time	the	parking	lot	of	the	West	Ivy	Shopping	Center	is
crawling	 with	 federal	 agents,	 all	 dressed	 in	 a	 wide	 variety	 of	 casual	 garb	 and
driving	nondescript	vehicles.	Those	with	more	substantial	weapons	are	hiding	in
unmarked	vans.
The	 unlucky	 john	 is	 a	 forty-one-year-old	 car	 salesman	 named	 Ben	 Brown.
Husband,	 father	 of	 four,	 nice	 home	 not	 far	 away.	 After	 therapy,	 he	 leaves	 Atlas
through	an	unmarked	door,	makes	it	to	his	vehicle,	a	demo,	and	is	allowed	to	drive
half	 a	 mile	 before	 being	 pulled	 over	 by	 a	 local	 cop.	 Ben’s	 first	 words	 are	 to	 the
effect	that	he	damned	well	wasn’t	speeding,	but	when	a	black	SUV	wheels	to	a	stop
in	front	of	him	he	suspects	deeper	trouble.	He	is	introduced	to	two	FBI	agents	and
led	 to	 the	 rear	 seat	 of	 their	 vehicle.	 He	 is	 placed	 under	 arrest	 for	 soliciting
prostitution	 and	 told	 he	 will	 probably	 be	 indicted	 for	 all	 manner	 of	 federal
offenses	at	a	later	date.	Atlas,	he	is	informed,	is	part	of	an	interstate	sex	ring;	thus
the	federal	charges.	Ben’s	life	flashes	before	his	eyes	and	he’s	barely	able	to	hold
back	 tears.	 He	 tells	 the	 agents	 he	 has	 a	 wife	 and	 four	 kids.	 They	 are	 not
sympathetic.	He’s	facing	years	in	jail.
The	agents,	however,	are	willing	to	deal.	If	he	tells	them	everything,	they	will
allow	 him	 to	 hop	 in	 his	 car	 and	 drive	 away,	 a	 free	 man.	 On	 the	 one	 hand,
something	tells	Ben	to	clam	up	and	demand	an	attorney.	On	the	other,	he	wants	to
trust	them	and	save	his	skin.
He	 starts	 talking.	 This	 is	 his	 fourth	 or	 fifth	 visit	 to	 Atlas.	 He	 usually	 had	 a
different	 girl;	 that’s	 what	 he	 likes	 about	 the	 place,	 the	 variety.	 Three	 hundred
bucks	a	pop.	No	paperwork,	of	course	not.	He	was	recommended	by	a	friend	at	the
car	 dealership.	 Everything	 is	 kept	 very	 quiet.	 Yes,	 he	 has	 vouched	 for	 two	 other
buddies.	 Recommendations	 are	 required;	 security	 seems	 tight;	 confidentiality
ensured.	Inside,	there	is	a	small	reception	area	where	he	always	meets	the	same
man,	 Travis,	 who	 wears	 a	 white	 lab	 coat,	 tries	 to	 look	 the	 part.	 Through	 a	 door
there	are	six	to	eight	rooms,	all	about	the	same—small	bed,	small	chair,	naked	girl.
Things	go	quick.	It’s	sort	of	like	a	drive-through	sex	shop,	in	and	out,	unlike	one
time	 in	 Vegas	 where	 the	 girl	 hung	 around	 and	 they	 ate	 chocolates	 and	 drank
champagne.
No	smiles	from	the	FBI.	“Any	other	men	there?”
Yes,	 maybe,	 seems	 like	 there	 was	 one	 other	 guy	 one	 time.	 Everything’s	 real
clean	 and	 efficient,	 except	 the	 walls	 are	 pretty	 thin	 and	 it’s	 not	 unusual	 to	 hear
some	 rather	 graphic	 sounds	 from	 other	 therapy	 sessions.	 The	 girls?	 Well,	 of
course	 there	 is	 a	 Tiffany	 and	 a	 Brittany	 and	 an	 Amber,	 but	 who	 knows	 what	 the
real	names	are.
Ben	 is	 told	 to	 go	 and	 sin	 no	 more.	 He	 speeds	 away,	 eager	 to	 run	 tell	 his

buddies	to	stay	away	from	Atlas.
The	 raid	 happens	 moments	 later.	 With	 all	 doors	 blocked	 by	 heavily	 armed
agents,	there	is	no	time	to	even	think	about	resistance	or	escape.	Three	men	are
handcuffed	 and	 hauled	 away.	 Six	 girls,	 including	 Jiliana	 Kemp,	 are	 rescued	 and
taken	into	protective	custody.	Just	before	3:00	p.m.,	she	calls	her	parents,	sobbing
hysterically.	 She	 had	 been	 abducted	 thirteen	 months	 earlier.	 And,	 she	 had	 given
birth	in	captivity.	She	has	no	idea	what	happened	to	her	baby.
Under	enormous	pressure,	one	of	the	three	men,	an	American,	takes	the	bait
and	starts	singing.	Names	pour	forth,	then	addresses,	then	everything	else	he	can
think	of.	As	the	hours	pass,	the	web	grows	rapidly.	FBI	offices	in	a	dozen	cities	put
everything	else	on	hold.
One	 of	 Mayor	 Woody’s	 banker	 buddies	 has	 a	 corporate	 jet	 and	 the	 guy	 is
eager	 to	 send	 it.	 By	 7:00	 p.m.	 on	 a	 day	 when	 she	 would	 normally	 be	 ending
another	 nightmare	 at	 Atlas	 and	 preparing	 for	 a	 night	 of	 stripping	 and	 table
dancing,	Jiliana	Kemp	is	suddenly	flying	home.	A	flight	attendant	takes	care	of	her
and	will	later	say	she	cried	all	the	way.

18.
Once	again,	Arch	Swanger	slips	through	the	net.	There	is	no	sign	of	him	after
he	disappears	into	the	cornfield.	The	police	think	they	could	have	caught	him	then
and	there,	but	since	they	were	ordered	to	wait	until	after	the	raid,	they	somehow
lost	him.	It’s	apparent	that	he	has	an	accomplice.	From	the	point	where	I	picked
him	up	at	the	stop	sign	in	Jobes,	it’s	about	forty	miles	to	Dr.	Woo’s	sign	beside	the
interstate.	Someone	had	to	be	driving	a	getaway	car.
I	doubt	I’ve	heard	the	last	of	him.

19.
After	dark,	Partner	and	I	drive	to	the	jail	to	deliver	the	great	news	to	Tadeo.
He	 is	 being	 offered	 the	 deal	 of	 all	 deals—a	 light	 sentence,	 an	 easier	 prison,	 a
guarantee	of	early	parole	for	good	behavior.	With	some	luck,	he’ll	be	back	in	the
ring	 in	 two	 years,	 his	 career	 bolstered	 by	 the	 ex-con	 aura	 and	 that	 famous
YouTube	video.	I	have	to	admit	I’m	getting	excited	thinking	about	his	comeback.
With	great	satisfaction,	I	lay	it	all	on	the	table.	Or	most	of	it.	I	spare	him	the
details	of	the	Swanger	adventure,	and	instead	place	emphasis	on	my	prowess	as	a
negotiator	and	much-feared	trial	lawyer.
Tadeo	is	not	impressed.	He	says	no.	No!
I	 attempt	 to	 explain	 that	 he	 cannot	 simply	 say	 no.	 He’s	 facing	 a	 decade	 or
more	 in	 a	 tough	 prison,	 and	 now	 I’m	 delivering	 a	 deal	 so	 fantastic	 that	 the
presiding	judge	can’t	believe	it.	Wake	up,	man!	No.
I	am	stunned,	incredulous.
He	sits	with	his	arms	crossed	over	his	chest,	such	an	arrogant	little	punk,	and
says	no	over	and	over.	No	deal.	He	will	not	plead	guilty	under	any	circumstances.
He	has	seen	his	jurors,	and,	after	a	few	doubts,	he	is	once	again	confident	they	will
not	convict	him.	He	will	insist	on	taking	the	stand	and	telling	his	side	of	the	story.
He	is	cocky,	hardheaded,	and	irritated	by	my	desire	to	see	him	plead	guilty.	I	keep
my	 cool	 and	 go	 back	 to	 the	 basics—the	 charges,	 the	 evidence,	 the	 video,	 the
shakiness	of	our	expert	testimony,	the	composition	of	the	jury,	the	bloodbath	that
awaits	 him	 on	 cross-examination,	 the	 likelihood	 of	 ten	 or	 more	 years	 in	 prison,
everything.	 Nothing	 registers.	 He’s	 an	 innocent	 man	 who	 sort	 of	 accidentally
killed	 a	 referee	 with	 nothing	 but	 his	 hands,	 and	 he	 can	 explain	 it	 all	 to	 the	 jury.
He’ll	walk	out	a	free	man,	and	when	he	does,	well,	then	it’ll	be	payback	time.	He’ll
find	 a	 new	 manager	 and	 a	 new	 lawyer.	 He	 accuses	 me	 of	 being	 disloyal.	 This
makes	me	angry	and	I	tell	him	he’s	being	stupid.	I	ask	him	whom	he’s	listening	to
back	 there	 in	 the	 cell	 block.	 Things	 go	 from	 bad	 to	 worse,	 and	 after	 an	 hour	 I
storm	out	of	the	room.
I	 thought	 I	 might	 sleep	 tonight,	 but	 it	 looks	 like	 I’ll	 go	 through	 the	 usual
pretrial	insomnia.

20.
At	 5:00	 on	 Thursday	 morning,	 I’m	 drinking	 strong	 coffee	 and	 reading	 the
Chronicle	 online.	 It’s	 all	 about	 the	 rescue	 of	 Jiliana	 Kemp.	 The	 largest	 photo	 on
page	 one	 is	 just	 what	 I	 envisioned:	 Mayor	 Woody	 at	 the	 podium	 in	 all	 his	 glory,
with	Roy	Kemp	beside	him,	a	wall	of	blue	behind	them.	Jiliana	is	not	in	the	photo,
though	 there	 is	 a	 slightly	 smaller	 one	 of	 her	 getting	 off	 the	 jet	 at	 the	 airport.
Baseball	 cap,	 big	 sunglasses,	 collar	 turned	 up,	 you	 can’t	 tell	 much	 but	 she	 looks
reasonably	good.	She	is	resting	at	home	with	her	family	and	friends,	it	says.	The
sex-trafficking	 story	 runs	 for	 pages,	 and	 the	 FBI	 operation	 is	 obviously	 still	 in
progress.	Arrests	are	being	made	across	the	country.	So	far,	about	twenty-five	girls
have	been	rescued.	There	was	a	shooting	in	Denver	but	no	serious	injuries.
Thankfully,	there’s	not	a	word	about	Jiliana’s	heroin	addiction,	or	about	the
lost	 baby.	 One	 nightmare	 is	 over;	 others	 continue.	 I	 suppose	 I	 should	 take	 some
measure	of	quiet	satisfaction	in	having	had	a	hand	in	this,	but	I	don’t.	I	bartered
information	to	benefit	a	client.	That’s	all.	Now	that	client	has	gone	stupid	and	I	get
nothing	out	of	the	deal.
I	wait	until	7:00	a.m.	to	send	a	text	message	to	both	Max	Mancini	and	Judge
Fabineau.	 It	 reads,	 “After	 extensive	 discussions,	 my	 client	 refuses	 to	 accept	 the
plea	agreement	now	being	offered	by	the	prosecution.	I	have	strongly	advised	him
to	 accept	 it,	 to	 no	 avail.	 It	 appears	 as	 though	 the	 trial	 must	 go	 on,	 pending	 the
health	of	the	judge.	Sorry.	SR.”
Mancini	 responds,	 “Let’s	 tee	 it	 up.	 See	 u	 soon.”	 He,	 of	 course,	 is	 thrilled
because	 he’s	 back	 on	 center	 stage.	 Evidently,	 Judge	 Fabineau	 has	 made	 a	 quick
recovery.	She	texts,	“Ok,	the	show	must	go	on.	We’ll	meet	in	chambers	at	8:30.	I’ll
inform	my	bailiff.”

21.
The	players	assemble	in	the	courtroom	as	if	nothing	happened	yesterday,	or
at	least	nothing	that	would	in	any	way	affect	the	trial.	A	few	of	us	know—me,	the
prosecutor,	the	judge,	Partner—but	no	one	else	knows,	nor	should	they.	I	whisper
to	Tadeo.	He	has	not	changed	his	mind;	he	can	win	this	trial.
We	retire	to	the	judge’s	chambers	for	our	early	morning	update.	To	cover	my
ass,	I	inform	her	and	Max	that	I	want	to	put	my	client	on	the	record,	so	there	will
be	no	doubt	in	the	years	to	come	about	his	refusal	to	take	a	plea.	A	bailiff	brings
him	in,	no	cuffs,	no	restraints.	He’s	smiling	and	being	very	polite.	He’s	put	under
oath	 and	 says	 he	 has	 a	 clear	 mind	 and	 knows	 what’s	 going	 on.	 Fabineau	 asks
Mancini	 to	 recite	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 plea	 agreement:	 five	 years	 for	 a	 guilty	 plea	 to
manslaughter.	 Her	 Honor	 says	 that	 she	 cannot	 promise	 any	 particular	 prison
facility,	 but	 is	 of	 the	 opinion	 that	 Mr.	 Zapate	 would	 do	 quite	 well	 just	 down	 the
road	 at	 the	 county	 penal	 farm.	 Only	 six	 miles	 away;	 his	 mother	 can	 visit
frequently.	Furthermore,	she	does	not	control	parole,	but	as	the	sentencing	judge
she	has	the	authority	to	recommend	an	early	release.
Does	 he	 understand	 all	 of	 this?	 He	 says	 he	 does,	 and	 goes	 on	 to	 say	 that	 he
ain’t	pleading	guilty	to	anything.
I	state	that	I	have	advised	him	to	take	the	deal.	He	says	yes,	he	understands
my	advice,	but	he’s	not	taking	it.	We	go	off	the	record	and	the	court	reporter	shuts
down.	 Judge	 Fabineau	 folds	 her	 fingers	 together	 like	 a	 veteran	 kindergarten
teacher,	and	in	a	painfully	deliberate	manner	tells	Tadeo	that	she	has	never	seen
such	a	good	deal	for	any	defendant	charged	with	the	death	of	another	person.	In
other	words,	boy,	you’re	a	fool	to	refuse	this	deal.
He	doesn’t	budge.
Next,	 Max	 explains	 that	 he,	 as	 a	 career	 prosecutor,	 has	 never	 offered	 a	 plea
deal	as	lenient	as	this	one.	It’s	extraordinary,	really.	Eighteen	months	or	so	in	the
pen,	full	access	to	the	weight	room,	and	there	are	excellent	facilities	at	the	penal
farm,	and	you’ll	be	back	in	the	cage	before	you	know	it.
Tadeo	just	shakes	his	head.

22.
The	jurors	file	in	and	glance	around	expectantly,	nervously.	There	is	an	air	of
excitement	 in	 the	 courtroom	 as	 this	 drama	 is	 about	 to	 unfold,	 but	 I	 feel	 nothing
but	the	usual	thick	knot	in	my	stomach.	The	first	day	is	always	the	hardest.	As	the
hours	 pass,	 we’ll	 settle	 into	 a	 routine	 and	 the	 butterflies	 will	 slowly	 dissipate.	 At
the	moment,	though,	I’d	like	to	go	vomit.	An	old	trial	lawyer	once	told	me	that	if
the	day	came	when	I	walked	into	a	courtroom	and	faced	a	jury	without	fear,	then	it
was	time	to	quit.
Max	rises	purposefully	and	walks	to	a	spot	in	front	of	the	jury	box.	He	offers
his	 standard	 welcoming	 smile	 and	 says	 good	 morning.	 Sorry	 about	 the	 delay
yesterday.	Again,	his	name	is	Max	Mancini,	chief	prosecutor	for	the	City.
This	is	a	grave	matter	because	it	involves	the	loss	of	life.	Sean	King	was	a	fine
man	with	a	loving	family,	a	hardworking	guy	trying	to	earn	a	few	bucks	on	the	side
as	a	referee.	There	is	no	dispute	as	to	the	cause	of	death,	or	who	killed	him.	The
defendant,	sitting	right	over	there,	will	try	and	confuse	you,	try	and	convince	you
that	 the	 law	 makes	 exceptions	 for	 people	 who	 temporarily,	 or	 permanently,	 lose
their	minds.
Baloney.	 He	 rambles	 on	 a	 bit	 without	 notes,	 and	 I’ve	 known	 for	 some	 time
that	 Max	 gets	 in	 trouble	 when	 he	 goes	 off	 script.	 The	 more	 skilled	 courtroom
advocates	convey	the	impression	that	they	are	speaking	extemporaneously,	while
in	 truth	 they	 have	 spent	 hours	 memorizing	 and	 rehearsing.	 Max	 is	 not	 one	 of
those,	 but	 he’s	 not	 as	 bad	 as	 most	 prosecutors.	 He	 does	 a	 very	 smart	 thing	 by
promising	the	jurors	that	they	will	soon	see	the	now	famous	video.	He	makes	them
wait.	He	could,	even	at	this	initial	stage	of	the	trial,	show	the	video.	Go	Slow	has
already	said	so.	But	he	teases	them	with	it.	Nice	move.
His	opening	statement	is	not	long	because	his	case	is	ironclad.	Impulsively,	I
stand	 and	 tell	 Her	 Honor	 that	 I	 will	 reserve	 my	 opening	 statement	 until	 the
beginning	of	our	defense,	an	option	under	our	rules.	Max	bounces	forth	and	calls
as	 his	 first	 witness	 the	 widow,	 Mrs.	 Beverly	 King.	 She’s	 a	 nice-looking	 lady,
dressed	for	church,	and	terrified	of	the	witness	chair.	Max	walks	her	through	the
standard	 sympathy	 ritual	 and	 within	 minutes	 she’s	 in	 tears.	 Though	 such
testimony	has	nothing	at	all	to	do	with	guilt	or	innocence,	it	is	always	allowed	to
hammer	 home	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 deceased	 is	 indeed	 dead	 and	 that	 he	 or	 she	 left
behind	 loved	 ones.	 Sean	 was	 a	 faithful	 partner,	 devoted	 father,	 hard	 worker,
breadwinner,	loving	son	to	his	dear	mother.	Between	sobs	we	get	the	picture,	and,
as	always,	it	is	dramatic.	The	jurors	swallow	it	whole	and	a	few	glare	at	Tadeo.	I’ve
yelled	at	him	not	to	look	at	the	jurors,	but	instead	sit	attentively	at	the	table	and
scribble	nonstop	on	a	legal	pad.	Do	not	shake	your	head.	Do	not	show	any	reaction
or	emotion.	At	any	given	time,	at	least	two	members	of	the	jury	are	looking	at	you.

I	do	not	cross-examine	Mrs.	King.	She	is	excused	and	returns	to	her	seat	next
to	her	three	children	in	the	front	row.	It’s	a	lovely	family,	on	display	for	everyone,
but	especially	the	jurors.
The	 next	 witness	 is	 the	 medical	 examiner,	 a	 forensic	 pathologist	 named	 Dr.
Glover,	 a	 veteran	 of	 these	 battles.	 Because	 my	 career	 has	 involved	 a	 number	 of
grisly	murder	cases,	Dr.	Glover	and	I	have	tangled	before	in	front	of	juries.	Indeed,
in	 this	 very	 courtroom.	 He	 conducted	 an	 autopsy	 on	 Sean	 King	 the	 day	 after	 he
died	and	has	photos	to	prove	it.	A	month	ago	Mancini	and	I	almost	came	to	blows
over	 the	 autopsy	 photos.	 Normally,	 they	 are	 not	 admitted	 because	 their
gruesomeness	is	so	prejudicial.	However,	Max	convinced	Go	Slow	that	three	of	the
milder	 ones	 are	 probative.	 The	 first	 is	 of	 Sean	 lying	 on	 the	 slab,	 naked	 but	 for	 a
white	 towel	 over	 his	 midsection.	 The	 second	 is	 a	 close-up	 of	 his	 face	 with	 the
camera	directly	above	him.	The	third	is	of	his	shaved	head,	turned	to	the	right	to
reveal	considerable	swelling	from	several	incisions.	The	twenty	or	so	photos	wisely
excluded	by	Go	Slow	are	so	graphic	that	no	sane	trial	judge	would	allow	the	jury	to
see	them:	sawing	off	the	top	of	the	skull;	tight	photos	of	the	damaged	brain;	and
the	last	one	of	the	brain	sitting	alone	on	a	lab	table.
The	 ones	 deemed	 admissible	 are	 projected	 on	 a	 tall,	 wide	 screen.	 Mancini
walks	 the	 doctor	 through	 each	 one.	 The	 cause	 of	 death	 was	 blunt-force	 trauma
inflicted	by	repeated	blows	to	the	upper	face.	How	many	blows?	Well,	we	have	the
video	 to	 show	 us.	 This	 is	 another	 smart	 move	 by	 Max—to	 introduce	 the	 footage
with	the	medical	expert	on	the	stand.	The	lights	go	dim,	and	on	the	large	screen
we	 get	 to	 relive	 the	 tragedy:	 the	 two	 fighters	 in	 the	 center	 of	 the	 ring,	 both
confident	 of	 victory;	 Sean	 King	 raises	 the	 right	 hand	 of	 Crush,	 who	 seems
surprised;	Tadeo’s	shoulders	slump	in	disbelief,	then	suddenly	he	hits	Crush	from
the	side,	a	real	sucker	punch;	before	Sean	King	can	react,	Tadeo	lands	a	hard	right
to	his	nose,	then	a	left;	Sean	King	falls	back	and	lands	against	the	wire	cage,	where
he	 sits,	 slumped	 over,	 defenseless,	 out	 cold;	 and	 Tadeo	 springs	 on	 him	 like	 an
animal,	pounding	away.
“Twenty-two	 blows	 to	 the	 head,”	 Dr.	 Glover	 tells	 the	 jurors,	 who	 are
mesmerized	by	the	violence.	They’re	watching	a	perfectly	healthy	man	get	beaten
to	death.
And	my	idiot	client	thinks	he’ll	walk.
The	video	ends	when	Norberto	rushes	into	the	ring	and	grabs	Tadeo.	At	that
point,	Sean	King’s	chin	is	on	his	chest	and	his	face	is	nothing	but	blood.	Crush	is
out	cold.	Chaos	ensues	as	others	scramble	into	the	picture.	As	the	riot	breaks	out,
the	screen	goes	black.
Doctors	tried	everything	to	relieve	the	intense	swelling	of	Sean	King’s	brain,
but	nothing	worked.	He	died	five	days	later	without	regaining	consciousness.	An
image	of	a	CT	scan	takes	the	place	of	the	video,	and	Dr.	Glover	talks	about	cerebral
contusions.	 Another	 image,	 and	 he	 talks	 about	 hemorrhaging	 within	 the
hemispheres.	 Another	 reveals	 a	 large	 subdural	 hematoma.	 The	 witness	 has	 been

discussing	autopsies	and	causes	of	death	with	juries	for	many	years,	and	he	knows
how	to	testify.	He	takes	his	time,	explains	things,	and	tries	to	avoid	esoteric	words
and	phrases.	This	must	be	one	of	his	easier	cases	because	of	the	video.	The	victim
was	perfectly	healthy	when	he	walked	into	the	cage.	He	left	on	a	stretcher	and	the
world	knows	why.
Arguing	 with	 a	 true	 expert	 in	 front	 of	 a	 jury	 is	 always	 tricky	 business.	 More
often	than	not,	the	lawyer	loses	both	the	fight	and	his	credibility.	Because	of	the
facts	in	this	case,	I	have	very	little	credibility	to	begin	with.	I’m	not	willing	to	lose
any	more.	I	stand	and	politely	say,	“No	questions.”
When	I	sit	down,	Tadeo	hisses	at	me,	“What’re	you	doing,	man?	You	gotta	go
after	these	dudes.”
“Knock	 it	 off,	 okay?”	 I	 say	 through	 gritted	 teeth.	 I’m	 really	 tired	 of	 his
arrogance	and	he’s	obviously	distrustful	of	me.	I	doubt	if	things	will	improve.

23.
As	we	break	for	an	afternoon	recess,	I	get	a	text	message	from	Miguel	Zapate.
I’ve	 seen	 him	 in	 the	 courtroom	 throughout	 the	 morning,	 one	 of	 several	 relatives
and	friends	clustered	in	the	back	row,	watching	intently	but	from	as	far	away	as
possible.	We	meet	in	the	hallway	and	stroll	outside.	Norberto,	the	former	manager
of	 Team	 Zapate,	 joins	 us.	 Partner	 follows	 at	 a	 distance.	 I	 make	 sure	 they
understand	 that	 Tadeo	 is	 refusing	 a	 very	 good	 plea	 bargain.	 He	 could	 be	 out	 in
eighteen	months	and	fighting	again.
But	they	have	a	better	deal.	Juror	number	ten	is	Esteban	Suarez,	age	thirtyeight,	 a	 truck	 driver	 for	 a	 food	 supply	 company.	 Fifteen	 years	 ago	 he	 emigrated
legally	from	Mexico.	Miguel	says	he	has	a	friend	who	knows	him.
I	 hide	 my	 surprise	 as	 we	 wade	 into	 treacherous	 waters.	 We	 turn	 down	 a
narrow	one-way	street	with	all	sunlight	blocked	by	tall	buildings.	“How	does	your
friend	know	him?”	I	ask.
Miguel	 is	 a	 street	 punk,	 a	 low-end	 drug	 runner	 for	 a	 gang	 that	 is	 heavily
involved	 with	 cocaine	 smuggling	 but	 not	 heavily	 involved	 with	 its	 profits.	 In	 the
murky	chain	of	distribution,	Miguel	and	his	boys	are	stuck	in	the	middle	with	no
room	to	grow.	This	is	where	Tadeo	was	when	we	met	less	than	two	years	ago.
Miguel	shrugs	and	says,	“My	friend	knows	lots	of	people.”
“I’m	 sure	 he	 does.	 And	 when	 did	 your	 friend	 meet	 Mr.	 Suarez?	 Within	 the
past	twenty-four	hours?”
“It	doesn’t	matter.	What	matters	is	the	fact	that	we	can	deal	with	Suarez,	and
he’s	not	that	expensive.”
“Bribing	a	juror	can	land	you	in	the	same	pen	with	Tadeo.”
“Senor,	 please.	 For	 ten	 grand	 Suarez	 hangs	 the	 jury,	 maybe	 even	 gets	 an
acquittal.”
I	 stop	 walking	 and	 stare	 at	 this	 small-time	 thug.	 What	 does	 he	 know	 about
acquittals?	 “If	 you	 think	 that	 jury	 is	 going	 to	 let	 your	 brother	 walk,	 then	 you’re
crazy,	Miguel.	Ain’t	going	to	happen.”
“Okay,	 then	 we	 hang	 it.	 You	 said	 yourself	 that	 if	 they	 hang	 once,	 then	 hang
twice,	then	the	prosecutor	will	dismiss	everything.”
I	 start	 walking	 again,	 slowly	 because	 I’m	 not	 sure	 where	 we’re	 headed.
Partner	trails	fifty	yards	behind.	I	say,	“Fine,	go	bribe	a	juror,	but	I’m	not	getting
involved.”
“Okay,	senor,	give	me	the	cash	and	I’ll	get	it	done.”
“Oh,	I	see.	You	need	the	money.”

“Yes,	senor.	We	don’t	have	that	kind	of	cash.”
“I	don’t	either,	especially	not	after	representing	your	brother.	I’ve	forked	over
thirty	 grand	 for	 a	 jury	 consultant	 and	 twenty	 for	 a	 shrink,	 plus	 twenty	 more	 for
other	expenses.	Keep	in	mind,	Miguel,	in	my	business	I’m	supposed	to	get	paid	by
the	client,	cash	fees	for	representation.	And	the	client	also	covers	all	expenses.	It’s
not	the	other	way	around.”
“Is	that	why	you’re	not	fighting?”
I	 stop	 again	 and	 glare	 at	 him.	 “You	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 you’re	 talking	 about,
Miguel.	 I’m	 doing	 the	 best	 I	 can	 with	 the	 facts	 I	 have.	 You	 guys	 are	 under	 some
misguided	notion	that	I	can	fit	your	brother	into	a	big,	mysterious	loophole	in	the
law	and	walk	him	out	of	there	a	free	man.	Guess	what?	It	ain’t	going	to	happen,
Miguel.	Tell	that	to	your	hardheaded	brother.”
“We	need	ten	thousand,	Rudd.	And	now.”
“Too	bad.	I	don’t	have	it.”
“We	want	a	new	lawyer.”
“Too	late.”

24.
D	 is	 for	 donut.	 After	 another	 sleepless	 night	 I	 meet	 Nate	 Spurio	 at	 a	 bakery
near	 the	 university.	 For	 breakfast	 he’s	 having	 two	 honey-glazed	 filled	 with	 jelly,
and	black	coffee.	I’m	not	hungry,	so	I	choke	down	the	coffee.	After	a	few	minutes
of	 small	 talk,	 I	 say,	 “Look,	 Nate,	 I’m	 pretty	 busy	 these	 days.	 What’s	 on	 your
mind?”
“The	trial,	huh?”
“Yes.”
“I	hear	you’re	getting	hammered.”
“It’s	pretty	ugly	in	there.	You	called.	What’s	up?”
“Not	 much.	 I’ve	 been	 asked	 to	 pass	 along	 some	 kind	 words	 from	 Roy	 Kemp
and	family.	They	took	the	girl	off	to	rehab	someplace.	She’s	a	mess,	obviously,	but
at	least	she’s	safe	and	with	her	family.	I	mean,	look,	Rudd,	these	people	thought
she	 was	 dead.	 Now	 they	 got	 her	 back.	 They’ll	 do	 whatever	 it	 takes	 to	 make	 her
whole	again.	And,	they	might	have	a	lead	on	the	baby.	This	thing	is	still	unfolding
all	over	the	country.	More	arrests	last	night,	more	girls	taken	into	custody.	They
got	a	tip	related	to	the	baby-selling	angle	and	they’re	all	over	it.”
I	nod,	take	a	sip,	say,	“That’s	good.”
“Yes	it	is.	And	Roy	Kemp	wants	you	to	know	that	he	and	his	family	are	very
grateful	to	you	for	getting	the	girl	back	and	making	all	this	happen.”
“He	kidnapped	my	child.”
“Come	on,	Rudd.”
“His	daughter	was	kidnapped,	so	he	must	know	how	it	feels.	I	don’t	care	how
grateful	he	is.	He’s	lucky	I	called	off	the	FBI	or	he	might	be	sitting	in	jail.”
“Come	on,	Rudd.	Let	it	go.	There’s	a	happy	ending	here,	thanks	to	you.”
“I	deserve	nothing	and	I	want	no	part	of	it.	Tell	Mr.	Kemp	to	kiss	my	ass.”
“Will	 do.	 They	 got	 a	 lead	 on	 Swanger.	 Last	 night,	 a	 tip	 from	 a	 bartender	 in
Racine,	Wisconsin.”
“Great.	Can	we	meet	in	a	week	or	so	and	have	a	beer?	I’m	rather	preoccupied
right	now.”
“Sure.”

25.
I	huddle	with	Partner	and	Cliff	in	the	hallway	before	the	trial	resumes	Friday
morning.	 At	 this	 point	 Cliff’s	 job	 is	 to	 sit	 in	 various	 places	 among	 the	 spectators
and	watch	the	jurors.	His	reaction	to	yesterday	is	not	surprising:	The	jurors	have
no	sympathy	for	Tadeo	and	they’ve	made	up	their	minds.	Grab	the	plea	deal	if	it’s
still	 on	 the	 table,	 he	 keeps	 saying.	 I	 tell	 him	 about	 my	 conversation	 with	 Miguel
the	 day	 before.	 Cliff’s	 response:	 “Well,	 if	 you	 can	 bribe	 one	 you’d	 better	 do	 it
quick.”
As	the	jury	files	in,	I	steal	a	look	at	Esteban	Suarez.	I	planned	to	just	glance	at
him	quickly,	as	I	normally	do	during	trials.	However,	he’s	gawking	at	me	as	if	he
expects	 me	 to	 hand	 over	 an	 envelope.	 What	 a	 goofball.	 There	 is	 little	 doubt,
though,	that	someone	has	made	contact	with	him.	There’s	also	little	doubt	that	he
can’t	be	trusted.	Is	he	already	counting	his	money?
Judge	 Fabineau	 says	 good	 morning	 and	 welcomes	 everyone	 back	 to	 her
courtroom.	She	goes	through	the	standard	routine	of	quizzing	the	jurors	about	any
unauthorized	 contact	 with	 sinister	 people	 hoping	 to	 sway	 them.	 I	 glance	 back	 at
Suarez.	He’s	staring	at	me.	I’m	sure	others	are	noticing	this.
Mr.	 Mancini	 stands	 and	 announces,	 “Your	 Honor,	 the	 State	 rests.	 We	 may
have	additional	witnesses	for	rebuttal,	but	for	now	we’ll	rest.”
This	is	not	surprising	because	Max	gave	me	a	heads-up.	He’s	called	only	two
witnesses	because	that’s	all	he	needs.	Again,	the	video	says	it	all,	and	Max	is	wise
to	 let	 it	 speak	 for	 itself.	 He’s	 clearly	 established	 the	 cause	 of	 death	 and	 he’s
certainly	nailed	the	perpetrator.
I	walk	to	the	jury	box,	look	at	everyone	but	Suarez,	and	begin	by	stating	the
obvious.	My	client	killed	Sean	King.	There	was	no	premeditation,	no	planning.	He
hit	 him	 twenty-two	 times.	 And	 Tadeo	 doesn’t	 remember	 it.	 In	 the	 fifteen	 or	 so
minutes	 before	 he	 attacked	 Sean	 King,	 Tadeo	 Zapate	 was	 struck	 in	 the	 face	 and
head	a	total	of	thirty-seven	times	by	Crush,	also	known	as	Bo	Fraley.	Thirty-seven
times.	He	wasn’t	knocked	out,	but	he	was	mentally	impaired.	He	remembers	little
past	 the	 second	 round,	 when	 Crush	 landed	 a	 knee	 to	 his	 jaw.	 We	 will	 show	 you,
the	 jury,	 the	 entire	 fight,	 count	 the	 thirty-seven	 blows	 to	 the	 head,	 and	 prove	 to
you	that	Tadeo	did	not	know	what	he	was	doing	when	he	attacked	the	referee.
I	am	brief	because	there’s	just	not	much	I	can	say.	I	thank	them	and	leave	the
podium.
My	first	witness	is	Oscar	Moreno,	Tadeo’s	trainer	and	the	man	who	first	saw
his	 potential	 as	 a	 sixteen-year-old	 boxer.	 Oscar	 is	 about	 my	 age,	 older	 than
Tadeo’s	gang,	and	he’s	been	around	the	block.	He	hangs	out	in	a	gym	for	Hispanic
kids	and	offers	to	train	the	more	talented	ones.	He	also	happens	to	have	a	clean

record,	a	real	asset	when	calling	witnesses	to	the	stand.	Past	criminal	convictions
always	come	back	to	bite	you.	Juries	are	tough	on	felons	under	oath.
With	Oscar,	I	lay	the	groundwork	for	the	events	leading	up	to	the	fight.	It’s	an
effort	to	appeal	to	the	jury’s	sense	of	compassion.	Tadeo	is	a	poor	kid	from	a	poor
family	whose	only	real	chance	in	life	so	far	has	been	inside	the	cage.	We	finally	get
around	to	the	fight	and	the	courtroom	lights	go	down.	The	first	time	through,	we
watch	the	fight	without	interruption.	In	the	semidarkness,	I	watch	the	jurors.	The
women	are	turned	off	by	the	sport’s	brutality.	The	men	are	thoroughly	engrossed.
During	 the	 rerun,	 I	 stop	 the	 tape	 each	 time	 Tadeo	 takes	 a	 shot	 in	 the	 face.	 The
truth	is	that	most	of	these	were	not	that	damaging	and	Crush	scored	only	minor
points	 with	 them.	 But	 to	 jurors	 who	 don’t	 know	 any	 better,	 a	 punch	 to	 the	 face,
especially	 one	 blown	 out	 of	 proportion	 by	 Oscar	 and	 me,	 becomes	 a	 near-lethal
blow.	 Slowly,	 methodically,	 I	 count	 them.	 When	 they	 are	 displayed	 in	 such
exaggerated	manner,	one	can	easily	ask	how	in	the	world	Tadeo	stayed	on	his	feet.
With	1:20	to	go	in	the	second	round,	Crush	is	able	to	yank	Tadeo’s	head	down	and
bang	 it	 into	 his	 right	 knee.	 It’s	 a	 nasty	 shot	 all	 right,	 but	 one	 that	 hardly	 fazed
Tadeo.	Now,	though,	Oscar	and	I	make	it	look	like	the	cause	of	permanent	brain
damage.
I	 stop	 the	 video	 after	 the	 end	 of	 the	 second	 round,	 and	 through	 carefully
rehearsed	questions	and	answers	I	elicit	from	Oscar	his	impressions	of	his	fighter
between	rounds.	The	kid’s	eyes	were	glazed	over.	He	could	only	grunt,	not	speak.
He	was	unresponsive	to	questions	fired	at	him	by	Norberto	and	Oscar.	He,	Oscar,
thought	about	waving	the	ref	over	and	stopping	the	fight.
I	would	put	Norberto	on	the	stand	to	verify	these	lies,	but	he	has	two	felony
convictions	and	would	be	humiliated	by	Mancini.
Left	 unsaid	 in	 this	 testimony	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 I	 was	 also	 in	 the	 corner.	 I	 was
wearing	my	bright	yellow	“Tadeo	Zapate”	jacket	and	trying	to	act	as	though	I	was
somehow	 needed.	 I	 have	 explained	 this	 to	 Max	 and	 Go	 Slow	 and	 assured	 them
that	 I	 saw	 and	 heard	 nothing	 crucial.	 I	 was	 just	 a	 spectator;	 thus	 I	 cannot	 be
considered	a	witness.	Max	and	Go	Slow	know	I’m	here	out	of	love	and	not	money.
We	 watch	 the	 third	 round	 and	 count	 more	 blows	 to	 Tadeo’s	 head.	 Oscar
testifies	that	when	the	fight	was	over	Tadeo	thought	he	had	one	more	round.	He
was	out	of	it,	barely	conscious	but	still	on	his	feet.	After	he	attacked	Sean	King	and
was	pulled	off	by	Norberto	and	others,	he	was	like	an	enraged	animal,	unsure	of
where	 he	 was	 or	 why	 he	 was	 being	 restrained.	 Thirty	 minutes	 later,	 as	 he	 was
changing	in	the	dressing	room	while	the	police	watched	and	waited,	he	began	to
come	around.	He	wanted	to	know	what	the	cops	were	doing	there.	He	asked	who
won	the	fight.
All	 in	 all,	 not	 a	 bad	 job	 of	 creating	 some	 doubt.	 However,	 even	 a	 casual
viewing	of	all	three	rounds	clearly	shows	a	fight	that	was	fairly	even.	Tadeo	dished
out	as	much	damage	as	he	absorbed.

Mancini	 gets	 nowhere	 on	 cross.	 Oscar	 sticks	 to	 the	 facts	 he	 has	 created.	 He
was	there,	in	the	corner,	talking	to	his	fighter,	and	if	he	says	the	kid	took	too	many
shots	to	the	head,	so	be	it.	Max	can’t	prove	otherwise.
Next	I	call	our	expert,	Dr.	Taslman,	the	retired	psychiatrist	who	now	works	as
a	 professional	 witness.	 He	 wears	 a	 black	 suit,	 crisp	 white	 shirt,	 tiny	 red	 bow	 tie,
and	with	his	horn-rimmed	glasses	and	long,	flowing	gray	hair	he	looks	incredibly
smart.	I	slowly	walk	him	through	his	qualifications	and	tender	him	as	an	expert	in
the	field	of	forensic	psychiatry.	Max	has	no	objections.
I	 then	 ask	 Dr.	 Taslman	 to	 explain,	 in	 layman’s	 terms,	 the	 legal	 concept	 of
volitional	insanity,	the	standard	adopted	by	our	state	a	decade	ago.	He	smiles	at
me,	then	looks	at	the	jurors	in	much	the	same	way	an	old	professor	would	enjoy
chatting	with	his	adoring	students.	He	says,	“Volitional	insanity	means	simply	that
a	person	who	is	mentally	healthy	does	something	wrong,	and	at	the	time	he	knows
it’s	 wrong,	 but	 at	 that	 moment	 he	 is	 so	 mentally	 unbalanced,	 or	 deranged,	 he
cannot	prevent	himself	from	doing	it	anyway.	He	knows	it’s	wrong,	but	he	cannot
control	himself	and	thereby	commits	the	crime.”
He	has	watched	the	fight	many	times,	and	the	video	of	its	aftermath.	He	has
spent	a	few	hours	with	Tadeo.	During	their	first	meeting,	Tadeo	told	him	he	did
not	remember	the	attack	on	Sean	King.	Indeed,	he	remembered	virtually	nothing
after	the	second	round.	However,	during	a	later	session,	Tadeo	seemed	to	recollect
certain	things	that	happened.	For	example,	he	said	he	remembered	the	smug	look
on	 Crush’s	 face	 as	 his	 arm	 was	 raised	 in	 victory.	 He	 remembered	 the	 crowd
screaming	 its	 disapproval	 of	 the	 decision.	 He	 remembered	 his	 brother	 Miguel
yelling	 something.	 But	 he	 remembered	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 the	 assault	 on	 the
referee.	Regardless,	though,	of	what	he	remembered,	he	was	blinded	by	emotion
and	had	no	choice	but	to	attack.	He	had	been	robbed	and	the	nearest	official	was
Sean	King.
Yes,	 in	 Dr.	 Taslman’s	 opinion,	 Tadeo	 was	 so	 deranged	 he	 could	 not	 stop
himself.	Yes,	he	was	legally	insane,	and	therefore	unaccountable	for	his	actions.
And	 there	 is	 another,	 quite	 unusual	 factor	 in	 play	 here	 that	 makes	 the	 case
unique.	 Tadeo	 was	 in	 a	 cage	 designed	 for	 fighting.	 He	 had	 just	 spent	 nine	 long
minutes	 trading	 punches	 with	 another	 fighter.	 He	 makes	 his	 living	 punching
people.	To	him,	at	that	crucial	moment,	it	was	okay	to	settle	the	matter	with	more
punches.	Put	in	context,	and	in	the	environment	of	that	instant,	he	felt	as	if	he	had
no	choice	but	to	do	what	he	did.
When	I’m	finished	with	Taslman,	we	break	for	lunch.

I	 stop	 by	 Domestic	 Relations	 to	 check	 the	 court	 file.	 As	 expected,	 old	 Judge
Leef	has	denied	Judith’s	request	for	an	emergency	hearing,	and	has	scheduled	the
matter	 four	 weeks	 from	 now.	 His	 order	 also	 states	 that	 regular	 visitation	 will
continue	unchanged.	Take	that,	sweetheart.
Cliff,	 Partner,	 and	 I	 walk	 a	 few	 blocks	 to	 a	 diner	 and	 hide	 in	 a	 booth	 for	 a
quick	 sandwich.	 The	 morning’s	 testimony	 could	 not	 have	 gone	 better	 for	 Tadeo.
All	 three	 of	 us	 are	 surprised	 at	 how	 well	 Oscar	 did	 on	 the	 stand,	 and	 how
believable	he	was	in	telling	the	jurors	that	Tadeo	had	been	knocked	out,	but	was
still	 standing.	 Few	 fight	 fans	 would	 believe	 that,	 but	 there	 are	 none	 on	 our	 jury.
For	$20,000,	I	expected	Dr.	Taslman	to	perform	admirably,	and	he	did.	Cliff	says
the	 jurors	 are	 thinking	 now,	 with	 some	 doubt	 firmly	 planted.	 However,	 an
acquittal	is	impossible.	A	hung	jury	is	still	our	only	chance.	And	it	could	be	a	long
afternoon	as	Mancini	goes	after	our	expert.
Back	in	court,	Max	begins	by	asking,	“Dr.	Taslman,	at	what	moment	did	the
defendant	become	legally	insane?”
“There	 is	 not	 always	 a	 clear	 beginning	 and	 ending.	 Obviously,	 Mr.	 Zapate
became	furious	over	the	judges’	decision	awarding	the	fight	to	his	opponent.”
“So,	before	that	moment,	was	he	insane	by	your	definition?”
“It’s	not	clear.	There	is	a	strong	likelihood	that	Mr.	Zapate	had	been	mentally
impaired	during	the	last	few	minutes	of	the	fight.	This	is	a	very	unusual	situation,
and	it’s	not	possible	to	know	how	clearly	he	was	thinking	before	the	decision	was
announced.	It’s	pretty	obvious,	though,	that	he	snapped	quickly.”
“How	long	was	he	legally	insane?”
“I	don’t	think	it’s	possible	to	say.”
“Okay,	under	your	definition,	when	the	defendant	whirled	around	and	struck
Sean	King	with	the	first	punch,	was	that	an	assault?”
“Yes.”
“And	punishable	by	some	standard?”
“Yes.”
“And	excusable,	in	your	opinion,	because	of	your	definition	of	legal	insanity?”
“Yes.”
“You’ve	seen	the	video	many	times.	It’s	clear	that	Sean	King	made	no	effort	to
defend	himself	once	he	fell	to	the	deck	and	was	sitting	against	the	cage,	right?”
“That	appears	to	be	the	case.”

“Do	you	need	to	see	it	again?”
“No,	not	at	this	time.”
“So,	 after	 only	 two	 punches,	 Sean	 King	 is	 down	 and	 out,	 unable	 to	 protect
himself,	right?”
“That	appears	to	be	the	case,	yes.”
“Ten	 punches	 later,	 his	 face	 is	 bleeding	 and	 basically	 pulverized.	 He	 cannot
protect	 himself.	 The	 defendant	 has	 hit	 him	 twelve	 times	 around	 the	 eyes	 and
forehead.	Now,	at	that	point,	Doctor,	was	the	defendant	still	legally	insane?”
“He	could	not	control	himself,	so	the	answer	is	yes.”
Mancini	looks	at	the	judge	and	says,	“Okay.	I	want	to	run	the	video	again	in
slow	 motion.”	 The	 lights	 are	 dimmed	 yet	 again,	 and	 everyone	 stares	 at	 the	 large
screen.	Max	runs	it	in	super	slow-mo	and	announces	loudly	as	each	punch	lands,
“One!	Two!	He’s	down	now.	Three!	Four!	Five!”
I	 glance	 at	 the	 jurors.	 They	 may	 be	 tired	 of	 this	 footage	 but	 they’re	 still
captivated	by	it.
Max	 stops	 with	 blow	 number	 twelve	 and	 asks,	 “Now,	 Doctor,	 you’re	 telling
this	jury	that	they’re	looking	at	a	man	who	knows	he’s	doing	wrong,	violating	the
law,	 but	 cannot	 physically	 or	 mentally	 stop	 himself.	 Is	 that	 right?”	 Max’s	 tone	 is
one	 of	 incredulity	 and	 mockery,	 and	 it’s	 effective.	 What	 we’re	 watching	 is	 a
slaughter	by	one	pissed-off	fighter.	Not	a	man	driven	insane.
“That’s	correct,”	Dr.	Taslman	says,	not	yielding	an	inch.
Thirteen,	 fourteen,	 fifteen,	 Max	 counts	 them	 off	 slowly	 and	 stops	 at	 twenty.
Max	calls	out,	“Now,	at	this	point,	Doc,	is	he	still	insane?”
“He	is,	yes.”
Twenty-one,	twenty-two,	and	bodies	land	on	Tadeo	as	Norberto	finally	dives
on	and	stops	the	carnage.	Max	asks,	“How	about	now,	Doc,	they’ve	pulled	him	off
and	the	attack	is	over?	At	what	point	does	the	boy	return	to	sanity?”
“It’s	hard	to	say.”
“A	minute	later?	An	hour	later?”
“It’s	hard	to	say.”
“It’s	hard	to	say	because	you	don’t	know,	right?	In	your	opinion,	legal	sanity	is
like	a	switch	that	flips	on	and	off,	rather	conveniently	for	the	defendant,	right?”
“That’s	not	what	I	said.”
Max	pushes	a	button	and	the	screen	disappears.	The	lights	are	brightened	as
everyone	takes	a	breath.	Max	whispers	to	an	assistant	and	picks	up	another	legal
pad	covered	with	notes.	He	shuffles	to	the	podium,	glares	at	the	witness,	and	asks,
“What	if	he	hit	him	thirty	times,	Dr.	Taslman?	You’d	still	diagnose	him	as	legally

insane?”
“Under	the	same	set	of	facts,	yes.”
“Oh,	 we’re	 talking	 about	 the	 same	 facts.	 Nothing	 has	 changed.	 What	 about
forty	 times?	 Forty	 blows	 to	 the	 head	 of	 a	 man	 who’s	 clearly	 unconscious.	 Still
legally	insane,	Doc?”
“Yes.”
“This	 defendant	 showed	 no	 signs	 of	 stopping	 after	 only	 twenty-two.	 What	 if
he	landed	a	hundred	shots	to	the	head,	Doc?	Still	legally	insane	in	your	book?”
Taslman	 earns	 his	 money	 with	 “The	 greater	 number	 of	 punches	 is	 clearer
evidence	of	a	deranged	mind.”

27.
It’s	 Friday	 afternoon	 and	 there’s	 no	 way	 we	 can	 finish	 the	 trial	 today.	 Like
most	judges,	Go	Slow	likes	to	jump-start	the	weekend.	She	warns	the	jurors	about
unauthorized	 contact	 and	 recesses	 early.	 As	 the	 jurors	 file	 out,	 Esteban	 Suarez
glances	my	way	one	more	time.	It’s	as	if	he’s	still	looking	for	the	envelope.	Bizarre.
I	 spend	 a	 few	 minutes	 with	 Tadeo	 and	 recap	 the	 week.	 He	 still	 insists	 on
taking	 the	 stand,	 and	 I	 tell	 him	 that	 will	 probably	 happen	 Monday	 morning.	 I
promise	to	stop	by	the	jail	on	Sunday	and	go	through	his	testimony.	I	repeat	my
warning	that	it’s	never	a	good	idea	for	the	accused	to	testify.	He’s	taken	away	in
handcuffs.	 I	 spend	 a	 few	 minutes	 with	 his	 mother	 and	 family	 and	 answer	 their
questions.	I’m	still	pessimistic	but	I	try	to	hide	it.
Miguel	follows	me	out	of	the	courtroom	and	down	a	long	hallway.	When	no
one	 is	 listening,	 he	 says,	 “Suarez	 is	 waiting.	 Contact	 confirmed.	 He’ll	 take	 the
money.”
“Ten	grand?”	I	ask,	just	to	make	sure.
“Sí,	senor.”
“Then	go	for	it,	Miguel,	but	just	leave	me	out	of	it.	I’m	not	bribing	a	juror.”
“I	guess	then,	senor,	that	I	need	a	loan.”
“Forget	it.	I	don’t	make	loans	to	clients,	and	I	don’t	make	loans	that’ll	never
be	repaid.	You’re	on	your	own,	pal.”
“But	we	took	care	of	those	two	thugs	for	you.”
I	 stop	 and	 glare	 at	 him.	 This	 is	 the	 first	 time	 he’s	 mentioned	 Link’s	 boys—
Tubby	 and	 Razor.	 Slowly,	 I	 say,	 “For	 the	 record,	 Miguel,	 I	 know	 nothing	 about
those	two.	If	you	whacked	’em,	you	did	it	on	your	own.”
He’s	smiling	and	shaking	his	head.	“No,	senor,	we	did	it	as	a	favor	for	you.”
He	 nods	 to	 Partner	 in	 the	 distance.	 “He	 asked.	 We	 delivered.	 Now	 we	 need	 the
favor	returned.”
I	take	a	deep	breath	and	stare	at	a	huge	stained-glass	window	the	taxpayers
paid	for	a	century	earlier.	He	has	a	point.	Two	dead	thugs	are	worth	more	than	ten
grand,	 at	 least	 in	 the	 currency	 of	 the	 street.	 The	 breakdown	 comes	 with	 the
communication.	I	didn’t	request	two	dead	thugs.	But	now	that	I	benefit	from	their
demise,	am	I	obligated	to	return	the	favor?
Suarez	is	probably	wearing	a	wire	and	maybe	even	a	camera.	If	the	money	can
be	 traced	 to	 me,	 then	 I’m	 disbarred	 and	 headed	 for	 prison.	 I’ve	 had	 close	 calls
before,	and	I	prefer	life	on	the	outside.	I	swallow	hard	and	say,	“Sorry,	Miguel,	but
I	will	not	be	involved.”

I	 turn	 and	 he	 grabs	 my	 arm.	 I	 shake	 him	 off	 as	 Partner	 approaches.	 Miguel
says,	“You’ll	be	sorry,	senor.”
“Is	that	a	threat?”
“No.	A	promise.”

28.
There	are	fights	tonight,	but	I’ve	seen	enough	bloodshed	for	one	week.	I	need
to	find	another	sport,	and	at	the	moment	it	happens	to	be	chasing	the	most	lovely
Naomi	Tarrant.	Since	we’re	still	meeting	on	the	sly,	or	at	least	afraid	of	being	seen
by	someone	who	might	recognize	her	as	a	teacher,	we	are	visiting	dark	bars	and
low-end	restaurants.	Tonight	we	go	to	a	new	place,	a	Thai	restaurant	east	of	town,
far	away	from	the	school	where	Naomi	teaches	Starcher.	We	are	confident	we	will
not	be	seen	by	anyone	we	know.
Not	quite.	Naomi	sees	her	first,	and	since	she	can’t	believe	it,	she	asks	me	to
verify.	 It’s	 not	 easy	 because	 we	 don’t	 want	 to	 get	 caught.	 The	 restaurant	 is
sufficiently	dark	and	it	has	a	series	of	meandering	nooks	and	alcoves.	It’s	a	great
place	to	hide	and	have	a	meal	without	seeing	many	people.	As	Naomi	returns	from
the	ladies’	room,	she	sees	three	booths	in	the	rear	of	a	dining	room.	Seated	in	one
of	 them,	 side	 by	 side	 and	 deep	 in	 conversation,	 are	 Judith	 and	 another	 woman.
Not	 Ava,	 the	 current	 partner,	 but	 someone	 else.	 A	 curtain	 of	 beads	 is	 partially
closed	 at	 the	 booth	 and	 blocking	 some	 of	 the	 view,	 but	 she	 is	 certain	 it’s	 Judith.
Common	 sense	 would	 say	 that	 the	 two	 women,	 if	 only	 friends	 or	 associates	 or
colleagues,	 would	 be	 sitting	 across	 the	 table	 from	 each	 other.	 But	 these	 two
women	are	shoulder	to	shoulder	and	lost	in	another	world,	according	to	Naomi.
I	sneak	around	to	the	men’s	room,	duck	behind	some	fake	potted	plants	on	a
shelf,	 and	 see	 what	 I	 desperately	 want	 to	 see.	 I	 hustle	 back	 to	 the	 table	 and
confirm	it	all	with	Naomi.
I	 consider	 leaving	 and	 avoiding	 an	 embarrassing	 situation.	 We	 don’t	 want
Judith	to	see	us,	and	I’m	absolutely	certain	she	doesn’t	want	us	to	see	her.
I	consider	sending	Naomi	to	the	car,	then	crashing	Judith’s	little	rendezvous.
How	cool	it	would	be	to	watch	her	melt	and	start	lying.	I’ll	ask	about	Ava,	send	my
regards.
I	consider	Starcher	and	what	this	might	mean	in	the	war	being	waged	by	his
biological	 parents.	 His	 mothers	 aren’t	 legally	 married	 so	 I	 suppose	 it’s	 okay	 for
one	 or	 both	 to	 see	 other	 women,	 though	 I	 seriously	 doubt	 they	 have	 an	 open
relationship.	How	am	I	supposed	to	know	the	rules?	But	if	Ava	finds	out,	there	will
be	even	more	warfare,	more	grief	for	the	kid.	And	more	ammunition	for	me.
I	consider	calling	Partner	and	getting	him	to	follow	Judith,	maybe	take	some
photos.
As	I	consider	all	of	this	and	sip	a	whiskey	sour,	Judith	appears	from	around
the	 corner	 and	 walks	 straight	 to	 our	 table.	 In	 the	 distance	 I	 see	 her	 friend	 leave
hurriedly	through	the	front	door,	one	last	furtive,	tell-all	glance	over	her	shoulder.
Judith,	in	full-bitch	mode,	says,	“Well,	well,	didn’t	expect	to	see	you	here.”

I’m	not	about	to	allow	her	to	intimidate	Naomi,	who’s	temporarily	stricken.	I
say,	“Didn’t	expect	to	see	you	either.	Here	alone?”
“Yes,”	she	says.	“Just	picking	up	some	takeout.”
“Oh	really.	Then	who’s	the	girl?”
“What	girl?”
“The	girl	in	the	booth.	Short	sandy	hair,	buzzed	on	one	side	in	the	current	fad.
The	 girl	 who	 just	 broke	 her	 neck	 getting	 out	 of	 the	 front	 door.	 Does	 Ava	 know
about	her?”
“Oh,	that	girl.	She’s	just	a	friend.	Does	the	school	allow	its	teachers	to	date	its
parents?”
“It’s	frowned	upon	but	not	prohibited,”	Naomi	says	coolly.
“Does	Ava	allow	you	to	date	other	people?”	I	ask.
“Wasn’t	a	date.	She’s	just	a	friend.”
“Then	why	did	you	just	lie	about	her?	Why	did	you	lie	about	the	takeout?”
She	 ignores	 me	 and	 glares	 at	 Naomi.	 “I	 guess	 I	 should	 report	 this	 to	 the
school.”
“Go	ahead,”	I	say.	“I’ll	report	it	to	Ava.	Is	she	keeping	Starcher	while	you’re
out	fooling	around?”
“I’m	not	fooling	around	and	my	son	is	none	of	your	business	right	now.	You
blew	it	last	weekend.”
A	 little	 Thai	 guy	 in	 a	 suit	 eases	 over	 and	 with	 a	 big	 smile	 asks,	 “Everything
okay	here?”
“Yes,	she’s	just	leaving,”	I	say.	I	look	at	Judith.	“Please.	We’re	trying	to	order.”
“See	 you	 in	 court,”	 she	 hisses	 and	 turns	 on	 her	 heels.	 I	 watch	 her	 leave	 and
she	does	not	take	any	food	with	her.	The	little	Thai	guy	slides	away,	still	smiling.
We	drain	our	drinks	and	eventually	look	at	the	menus.
After	a	few	minutes,	I	say,	“Our	secret	is	safe.	She	won’t	say	anything	to	the
school	because	she	knows	I’ll	call	Ava.”
“You’d	really	do	that?”
“In	 the	 blink	 of	 an	 eye.	 This	 is	 a	 war,	 Naomi,	 and	 there	 are	 no	 rules,	 no
thoughts	of	fighting	fair.”
“Do	you	want	custody	of	Starcher?”
“No.	 I’m	 not	 a	 good	 enough	 father.	 But	 I	 do	 want	 to	 remain	 relevant	 in	 his
life.	Who	knows?	One	day	he	and	I	might	be	friends.”
We	spend	the	night	at	her	place	and	sleep	late	Saturday	morning.	We’re	both

exhausted.	We	awake	to	the	sounds	of	heavy	rain	and	decide	to	fix	omelets	and	eat
in	bed.

29.
The	last	witness	for	the	defense	is	the	defendant	himself.	Before	he	is	called
on	Monday	morning,	I	hand	the	judge	and	the	prosecutor	a	letter	I’ve	written	to
Tadeo	Zapate.	Its	purpose	is	to	inform	him	in	writing	that	he	is	testifying	against
the	advice	of	his	attorney.	I	grilled	him	for	two	hours	the	day	before,	and	he	thinks
he’s	ready.
He	 swears	 to	 tell	 the	 truth,	 smiles	 nervously	 at	 the	 jury,	 and	 immediately
learns	 the	 frightful	 lesson	 that	 the	 view	 from	 the	 witness	 stand	 is	 quite
intimidating.	Everyone	is	gawking	and	waiting	to	hear	what	he	might	possibly	say
in	 his	 defense.	 A	 court	 reporter	 will	 record	 every	 word.	 The	 judge	 is	 scowling
down,	as	if	she’s	ready	for	a	quick	reprimand.	The	prosecutor	is	eager	to	pounce.
His	 mother	 far	 away	 in	 the	 back	 row	 looks	 terribly	 worried.	 He	 takes	 a	 deep
breath.
I	walk	him	through	his	background—family,	education,	employment,	lack	of
criminal	 record,	 boxing	 career,	 and	 his	 success	 in	 mixed	 martial	 arts.	 The	 jury,
along	with	everyone	else	in	the	courtroom,	is	sick	of	the	video,	so	I	won’t	show	it.
Sticking	 to	 our	 script,	 we	 talk	 about	 the	 fight	 and	 he	 does	 an	 adequate	 job	 of
describing	what	it	was	like	getting	hit	so	many	times.	He	and	I	know	that	Crush
did	not	land	many	serious	blows,	but	no	one	on	the	jury	understands	this.	He	tells
the	jury	he	doesn’t	remember	the	end	of	the	fight,	but	can	recollect	a	fuzzy	image
of	 his	 opponent	 raising	 his	 arms	 in	 a	 victory	 that	 he	 didn’t	 deserve.	 Yes,	 he
snapped,	though	he	can’t	really	recall	everything.	He	was	overwhelmed	by	a	sense
of	injustice.	His	career	was	gone,	stolen.	He	vaguely	remembers	the	referee	raising
Crush’s	arm,	then	everything	went	black.	The	next	thing	he	remembered,	he	was
in	 the	 dressing	 room,	 and	 two	 cops	 were	 watching	 him.	 He	 asked	 the	 cops	 who
won	 the	 fight,	 and	 one	 of	 them	 said,	 “Which	 fight?”	 They	 put	 handcuffs	 on	 him
and	explained	he	was	under	arrest	for	aggravated	assault.	He	was	baffled	by	this,
couldn’t	believe	what	was	happening.	At	the	jail,	another	cop	told	him	Sean	King
was	in	critical	condition.	He,	Tadeo,	began	crying.
Even	 today,	 he	 still	 can’t	 believe	 it.	 His	 voice	 cracks	 a	 bit	 and	 he	 wipes
something	from	his	left	eye.	He’s	not	a	very	good	actor.
As	I	sit	down,	Mancini	bounces	to	his	feet	and	calls	out	the	first	question:	“So,
Mr.	 Zapate,	 how	 many	 times	 have	 you	 gone	 insane?”	 It’s	 a	 brilliant	 opening,	 a
great	line	delivered	with	just	enough	sarcasm.
He	proceeds	to	make	a	fool	out	of	Tadeo.	When	was	the	first	time	you	went
insane?	How	long	did	it	last?	Anybody	get	hurt	the	first	time?	Do	you	always	black
out	when	you	go	insane?	Have	you	seen	a	doctor	for	your	insanity?	No!	Why	not!
Since	 you	 attacked	 Sean	 King,	 have	 you	 been	 evaluated	 by	 a	 doctor,	 one	 not
connected	to	this	trial?	Does	insanity	run	in	your	family?

After	thirty	minutes	of	this	assault,	the	word	“insanity”	means	nothing.	It’s	a
joke.
Tadeo	 works	 hard	 to	 stay	 cool,	 but	 he	 can’t	 help	 himself.	 Mancini	 is
practically	laughing	at	him.	The	jurors	seem	amused.
Max	 asks	 about	 his	 record	 as	 an	 amateur	 boxer.	 Twenty-four	 wins,	 seven
losses.	Max	says,	“Now,	correct	me	if	I’m	wrong,	but	five	years	ago	when	you	were
seventeen	and	fighting	in	the	Golden	Gloves	district	tournament,	you	lost	a	split
decision	to	a	man	named	Corliss	Beane.	That	right?”
“Yes.”
“Very	tough	fight,	right?”
“Yes.”
“Were	you	upset	by	the	decision?”
“I	didn’t	like	it,	thought	it	was	wrong,	thought	I	won	the	fight.”
“Did	you	go	insane?”
“No.”
“Did	you	black	out?”
“No.”
“Did	you	in	any	way	voice	your	frustration	with	the	decision?”
“I	don’t	think	so.”
“Well,	do	you	remember	it	or	did	you	lose	your	memory	again?”
“I	remember	it.”
“While	you	were	still	in	the	ring,	did	you	hit	anybody?”
Tadeo	shoots	me	a	guilty	look	that	betrays	him,	but	says,	“No.”
Mancini	 takes	 a	 deep	 breath,	 shakes	 his	 head	 as	 if	 he	 hates	 to	 do	 what	 he’s
about	to	do,	and	says,	“Your	Honor,	I	have	another	bit	of	video	that	I	think	might
help	us	here.	It’s	the	end	of	the	fight	five	years	ago	with	Corliss	Beane.”
I	stand	and	say,	“Your	Honor,	I	know	nothing	about	this.	It	was	not	disclosed
to	me.”
Max	is	ready	because	he’s	been	planning	this	ambush	for	weeks.	He	says,	with
great	confidence,	“Your	Honor,	it	wasn’t	disclosed	because	that	was	not	required.
The	 State	 is	 not	 offering	 the	 video	 as	 proof	 of	 this	 defendant’s	 guilt;	 therefore,
under	our	Rule	92F,	there’s	no	disclosure.	Rather,	the	State	is	offering	the	video	to
challenge	the	credibility	of	this	witness.”
“Could	I	at	least	see	it	first	before	the	jury	sees	it?”	I	ask,	slowly.
“That	 sounds	 reasonable,”	 Go	 Slow	 responds.	 “Let’s	 take	 a	 fifteen-minute

recess.”
In	chambers,	we	watch	the	video:	Tadeo	and	Corliss	Beane	in	the	center	of	the
ring	with	the	ref,	who	raises	Beane’s	right	hand	in	victory;	Tadeo	yanks	away	from
the	ref,	walks	to	his	corner,	yelling	something	in	an	angry	fit;	he	stomps	around
the	 ring,	 becoming	 more	 unhinged	 with	 each	 second;	 he	 walks	 to	 the	 ropes,
screams	at	the	judges,	and	inadvertently	bumps	into	Corliss	Beane,	who’s	minding
his	own	business	and	savoring	the	win;	others	are	in	the	ring	and	someone	starts
pushing;	the	ref	steps	between	the	two	fighters	and	Tadeo	shoves	him;	the	ref,	a
big	 guy,	 shoves	 back;	 for	 a	 second	 it	 looks	 as	 though	 the	 ring	 is	 on	 the	 verge	 of
chaos,	but	someone	grabs	Tadeo	and	pulls	him	away,	kicking	and	screaming.
Again,	the	camera	doesn’t	lie.	Tadeo	looks	like	a	sore	loser,	a	hothead,	a	brat,
a	dangerous	man	who	doesn’t	care	if	he	starts	a	brawl.
Go	Slow	says,	“Looks	relevant	to	me.”

30.
I	watch	the	jurors	as	they	watch	the	video.	Several	shake	their	heads.	When
it’s	over,	the	lights	come	up,	and	Max	gleefully	returns	to	the	mock-insanity	crap
and	 hammers	 away.	 Tadeo’s	 credibility	 is	 thoroughly	 trashed.	 I	 cannot	 resurrect
him	on	redirect.
The	 defense	 rests.	 Mancini	 calls	 his	 first	 rebuttal	 witness,	 a	 shrink	 named
Wafer.	He	works	for	the	state	mental	health	department	and	has	credentials	that
cannot	be	questioned.	He	went	to	colleges	in	this	state	and	has	our	accent.	He	is
not	 the	 brilliant	 expert	 from	 afar	 like	 Taslman,	 but	 he’s	 quite	 effective.	 He’s
watched	the	videos,	all	of	them,	and	he’s	spent	six	hours	with	the	defendant,	more
time	than	Taslman.
I	haggle	with	Wafer	until	noon	but	score	little.	As	we	are	breaking	for	lunch,
Mancini	grabs	me	and	asks,	“Can	I	talk	to	your	client?”
“About	what?”
“The	deal,	man.”
“Sure.”
We	step	to	the	defense	table	where	Tadeo	is	sitting.	Max	leans	down	and	says
in	 a	 low	 voice,	 “Look,	 dude,	 I’m	 still	 offering	 five	 years,	 which	 means	 eighteen
months.	Manslaughter.	If	you	say	no,	you	really	are	insane	because	you’re	about	to
get	twenty	years.”
Tadeo	seems	to	ignore	him.	He	just	smiles,	shakes	his	head	no.
He’s	 even	 more	 confident	 now	 because	 Miguel	 has	 found	 the	 cash	 and
delivered	the	envelope	to	Suarez.	This,	I	will	learn	only	after	it’s	too	late.

31.
After	 lunch	 we	 meet	 in	 chambers,	 where	 Go	 Slow	 has	 on	 display	 a	 plastic
plate	 covered	 with	 sliced	 carrots	 and	 celery,	 as	 if	 we’re	 interrupting	 her	 meal.	 I
suspect	 it’s	 all	 for	 show.	 She	 asks,	 “Mr.	 Rudd,	 what	 about	 the	 plea	 bargain?	 I
understand	the	deal	is	still	on	the	table.”
I	 shrug	 and	 say,	 “Yes,	 Judge,	 I	 have	 discussed	 it	 with	 my	 client,	 as	 has	 Mr.
Mancini.	The	kid	won’t	budge.”
She	 says,	 “Okay,	 we’re	 off	 the	 record	 here.	 Now	 that	 I’ve	 seen	 the	 evidence,
I’m	leaning	toward	a	longer	sentence,	something	like	twenty	years.	I	didn’t	buy	the
insanity	 stuff,	 neither	 did	 the	 jury.	 It	 was	 a	 vicious	 attack	 and	 he	 knew	 exactly
what	he	was	doing.	I	think	twenty	years	is	appropriate.”
“May	I	pass	this	along	to	my	client?	Off	the	record,	of	course?”
“Please	do.”	She	drowns	some	celery	in	table	salt,	looks	at	Mancini,	and	asks,
“What’s	next?”
Max	says,	“I	have	just	one	more	witness,	Dr.	Levondowski,	but	I’m	not	sure
we	need	him.	What	do	you	think,	Judge?”
Go	 Slow	 bites	 the	 end	 of	 a	 stalk.	 “Your	 call,	 but	 I	 think	 the	 jury	 is	 ready.”
Chomp,	chomp.	“Mr.	Rudd?”
“You’re	asking	me?”
“Oh	why	not?”	Max	says.	“Put	yourself	in	my	shoes	and	make	the	call.”
“Well,	Levondowski	is	just	going	to	repeat	what	Wafer	said.	I’ve	crossed	him
before	and	he’s	okay,	but	I	think	Wafer	is	a	far	better	witness.	I’d	leave	it	at	that.”
Max	says,	“I	think	you’re	right.	We’ll	rest.”
United,	a	real	team.
During	 Max’s	 closing	 argument,	 I	 keep	 glancing	 at	 Esteban	 Suarez,	 who
seems	to	be	thoroughly	captivated	by	his	feet.	He’s	withdrawn	into	a	cocoon	and
appears	to	hear	nothing.	Something	has	changed	with	this	guy,	and	for	a	second	I
wonder	if	Miguel	has	managed	to	get	to	him.	If	not	with	cash,	then	with	threats,
intimidation.	Maybe	he’s	promised	a	few	pounds	of	cocaine.
Max	does	a	nice	job	of	recapping	the	case.	Mercifully,	he	does	not	show	that
damned	video	again.	He	drives	home	the	undeniable	point	that	Tadeo	might	not
have	 planned	 his	 deadly	 assault	 on	 Sean	 King,	 but	 he	 clearly	 intended	 to	 inflict
severe	physical	injury.	He	didn’t	intend	to	kill	the	referee,	but	in	fact	he	did.	He
could	have	thrown	one	punch,	or	two,	and	stopped.	Guilty	of	assault	but	no	major
crime.	 But	 no!	 Twenty-two	 vicious	 shots	 to	 the	 head	 of	 a	 man	 who	 could	 not
defend	 himself.	 Twenty-two	 blows	 delivered	 by	 a	 highly	 trained	 fighter	 whose

admitted	 goal	 was	 to	 see	 every	 opponent	 leave	 the	 ring	 on	 a	 stretcher.	 Well,	 he
achieved	his	goal.	Sean	King	left	on	a	stretcher	and	never	woke	up.
Max	fights	off	the	natural	prosecutorial	tendency	to	beat	the	drum	too	long.
He’s	got	the	jury	and	he	can	sense	it.	I	think	everybody	senses	it,	perhaps	with	the
exception	of	my	client.
I	 begin	 by	 saying	 that	 Tadeo	 Zapate	 is	 not	 a	 murderer.	 He’s	 lived	 on	 the
streets,	seen	his	share	of	violence,	even	lost	a	brother	to	senseless	gang	wars.	He’s
seen	it	all	and	wants	no	part	of	it.	That’s	why	his	record	is	spotless:	no	history	of
violence	outside	the	ring.	I	pace	back	and	forth	in	front	of	the	jury	box,	looking	at
each	juror,	trying	to	connect.	Suarez	looks	like	he	wants	to	crawl	into	a	hole.
I	play	for	sympathy	and	touch	slightly	on	the	issue	of	insanity.	I	ask	the	jury
for	a	not-guilty	verdict,	or,	in	the	alternative,	manslaughter.	When	I	return	to	the
defense	table,	Tadeo	has	moved	his	chair	as	far	away	from	mine	as	possible.
Judge	Fabineau	instructs	the	jurors,	and	they	retire	at	3:00	p.m.
The	 waiting	 begins.	 I	 ask	 a	 bailiff	 if	 Tadeo	 can	 visit	 with	 his	 family	 in	 the
courtroom	 while	 the	 jury	 is	 out.	 He	 confers	 with	 his	 colleagues	 and	 then
reluctantly	 agrees.	 Tadeo	 steps	 through	 the	 bar	 and	 takes	 a	 seat	 on	 the	 front
bench.	His	mother,	a	sister,	and	some	nieces	and	nephews	gather	around	him	and
everybody	has	a	good	cry.	Mrs.	Zapate	has	not	physically	touched	her	son	in	many
months	and	she	can’t	keep	her	hands	off	him.
I	leave	the	courtroom,	find	Partner,	and	head	for	a	coffee	bar	down	the	street.

32.
At	5:15,	the	jurors	file	back	into	the	courtroom,	and	there	is	not	a	single	smile
among	them.	The	foreman	hands	the	verdict	to	a	bailiff,	who	hands	it	to	the	judge.
She	reads	it,	very	slowly,	and	asks	the	defendant	to	please	stand.	I	stand	with	him.
She	clears	her	throat	and	reads,	“We,	the	jury,	find	the	defendant	guilty	of	seconddegree	murder	in	the	death	of	Sean	King.”
Tadeo	 utters	 a	 soft	 groan	 and	 drops	 his	 head.	 Someone	 in	 the	 Zapate	 clan
gasps	from	the	back	row.	We	sit	down	as	the	judge	polls	the	jurors.	One	by	one,	all
guilty,	 unanimous.	 She	 congratulates	 them	 on	 a	 fine	 job,	 tells	 them	 their	 checks
for	jury	duty	will	be	in	the	mail,	and	dismisses	them.	When	they’re	gone,	she	sets
deadlines	for	posttrial	motions	and	such,	and	gives	a	date	a	month	from	now	for
sentencing.	I	scribble	this	down	and	ignore	my	client.	He	ignores	me	right	back	as
he	wipes	his	eyes.	Bailiffs	surround	him	and	slap	on	handcuffs.	He	leaves	without
a	word.
As	the	courtroom	thins	out,	the	Zapate	family	makes	a	slow	exit.	Miguel	has
his	arm	around	his	mother,	who	is	distraught.	Once	they’re	outside	in	the	hallway,
and	within	clear	view	of	some	reporters	and	TV	cameras,	three	cops	in	suits	grab
Miguel	and	tell	him	he’s	under	arrest.
Obstruction	 of	 justice,	 bribery,	 and	 jury	 tampering.	 Suarez	 was	 indeed
wearing	a	wire.

33.
Since	 I	 lost,	 I	 avoid	 the	 reporters.	 My	 phone	 is	 buzzing,	 so	 I	 turn	 it	 off.
Partner	and	I	go	to	a	dark	bar	to	lick	our	wounds.	I	knock	back	almost	an	entire
pint	of	ale	before	either	of	us	speaks.	He	starts	with	“Say,	Boss,	how	close	did	you
come	to	bribing	Suarez?”
“I	thought	about	it.”
“I	know	you	did.	I	could	tell.”
“But	 something	 wasn’t	 right.	 Plus,	 Mancini	 was	 playing	 it	 straight,	 not
cheating.	When	the	good	guys	start	cheating,	then	I	have	no	choice.	But	Mancini
didn’t	have	to.	We	tried	a	clean	case,	which	is	unusual.”
I	 finish	 the	 pint	 and	 order	 another.	 Partner	 has	 had	 two	 sips	 of	 his.	 Miss
Luella	frowns	on	drinking	and	will	say	something	if	she	smells	it.
“What	happens	to	Miguel?”	he	asks.
“Looks	like	he’ll	be	spending	time	with	his	brother.”
“You	gonna	defend	him?”
“Hell	no.	I’m	sick	of	the	Zapate	boys.”
“You	think	he’ll	sing	about	Link’s	thugs?”
“I	 doubt	 it.	 He’s	 in	 enough	 trouble	 as	 it	 is.	 A	 couple	 of	 murders	 won’t	 help
him	much.”
We	order	a	basket	of	fries	and	call	it	dinner.
After	we	leave	the	bar,	I	keep	the	van	and	drop	Partner	off	at	his	apartment.
It’s	Monday	and	Naomi	is	busy	grading	tests.	“Make	sure	Starcher	gets	an	A,”	I	tell
her.	“Always,”	she	says.	I	need	to	be	loved	but	she	can’t	play	tonight.	I	finally	go
home,	and	the	place	feels	cold	and	lonely.	I	change	into	jeans	and	walk	down	to
The	Rack,	where	I	drink	beer,	smoke	a	cigar,	and	shoot	eight	ball	for	two	hours,	all
alone.	At	ten	I	check	my	phone.	Every	Zapate	in	town	is	looking	for	me:	mother,
an	aunt,	a	sister,	and	Tadeo	and	Miguel	from	jail.	Seems	they	need	me	now.	I’m
fed	up	with	these	people,	but	I	know	they’re	not	going	away.
Two	reporters	are	calling.	Mancini	wants	to	have	a	drink.	Why,	I	have	no	idea.
And	 there	 is	 a	 voice	 mail	 from	 Arch	 Swanger.	 Condolences	 on	 the	 big	 loss.
How	in	hell?
I	need	to	leave	town.	At	midnight,	I	load	the	van	with	some	clothes,	the	golf
clubs,	and	half	a	case	of	small-batch	bourbon.	I	flip	a	coin,	head	north,	and	last	for
two	hours	before	I	almost	fall	asleep.	I	stop	at	a	budget	motel	and	pay	forty	bucks
for	one	night.	I’ll	be	on	a	golf	course,	somewhere,	by	noon,	all	alone.
