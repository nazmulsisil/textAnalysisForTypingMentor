Introduction

Dinosaurs: facts and ﬁction
Dinosaurs were ‘borne’ ofﬁcially in 1842 as a result of some truly
brilliant and intuitive detective work by the British anatomist
Richard Owen (Figure 1), whose work had concentrated upon
the unique nature of some extinct British fossil reptiles.
At the time of Owen’s review, he was working on a surprisingly
meagre collection of fossil bones and teeth that had been discovered
up to that time and were scattered around the British Isles.
Although the birth of dinosaurs was relatively inauspicious
(ﬁrst appearing as an afterthought in the published report of the
11th meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science), they were soon to become the centre of worldwide
attention. The reason for this was simple. Owen worked in London,
at the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, at a time when the
British Empire was probably at its greatest extent. To celebrate such
inﬂuence and achievement, the Great Exhibition of 1851 was
devised. To house this event a huge temporary exhibition hall
(Joseph Paxton’s steel and glass ‘Crystal Palace’) was built on Hyde
Park in central London.
Rather than destroy the wonderful exhibition hall at the end of 1851
it was moved to a permanent site at the London suburb of
1

Sydenham (the future Crystal Palace Park). The parkland
surrounding the exhibition building was landscaped and arranged
thematically, and one of the themes depicted scientiﬁc endeavour
in the form of natural history and geology and how they had
contributed to unravelling the Earth’s history. This geological
theme park, probably one of the earliest of its kind, included
reconstructions of genuine geological features (caves, limestone
pavements, geological strata) as well as representations of the
2

inhabitants of the ancient world. Owen, in collaboration with
the sculptor and entrepreneur Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins,
populated the parkland with gigantic iron-framed and
concrete-clad models of dinosaurs (Figure 2) and other prehistoric
creatures known at this time. The advance publicity generated
before the relocated ‘Great Exhibition’ was re-opened in June
1854 included a celebratory dinner held on New Year’s Eve 1853
within the belly of a half-completed model of the dinosaur
Iguanodon and this ensured considerable public awareness of
Owen’s dinosaurs.

A remarkable piece of evidence in support of the notion that there
is a relationship between the latent appeal of dinosaurs and the
human psyche can be found in mythology and folklore. Adrienne

Introduction

The fact that dinosaurs were extinct denizens of hitherto
unsuspected earlier worlds, and were the literal embodiment of
the dragons of myth and legend, probably guaranteed their
adoption by society at large; they even appeared in the works of
Charles Dickens, who was a personal acquaintance of Richard
Owen. From such evocative beginnings public interest in dinosaurs
has been nurtured and maintained ever since. Quite why the appeal
should have been so persistent has been much speculated upon;
it may have much to do with the importance of story-telling as a
means of stimulating human imaginative and creative abilities. It
strikes me as no coincidence that in humans the most formative
years of intellectual growth and cultural development, between the
ages of about 3 and 10 years, are often those when the enthusiasm
for dinosaurs is greatest – as many parents can testify. The buzz of
excitement created when children glimpse their ﬁrst dinosaur
skeleton is almost palpable. Dinosaurs, as the late Stephen Jay
Gould – arguably our greatest popularizer of scientiﬁc natural
history – memorably remarked, are popular because they are ‘big,
scary and [fortunately for us] dead’, and it is true that their gaunt
skeletons exert a gravitational pull on the imaginative landscape of
youngsters.

Looked at through the harsh lens of objectivity, the cultural
pervasiveness of dinosaurs is extraordinary. After all, no human
being has ever seen a living non-avian dinosaur (no matter what
some of the more absurd creationist literature might claim). The
very ﬁrst recognizably human members of our species lived about
500,000 years ago. By contrast, the very last dinosaurs trod our
planet approximately 65 million years ago and probably perished,
5

Introduction

Mayor has shown that as early as the 7th century bc the Greeks had
contact with nomadic cultures in central Asia. Written accounts
at this time include descriptions of the Grifﬁn (or Gryphon): a
creature that reputedly hoarded and jealously guarded gold; it was
wolf-sized with a beak, four legs, and sharp claws on its feet.
Furthermore, Near East art of at least 3000 bc depicts Grifﬁn-like
creatures, as does that of the Mycenaean. The Grifﬁn myth arose in
Mongolia/north-west China, in association with the ancient caravan
routes and gold prospecting in the Tienshan and Altai Mountains.
This part of the world (we now know) has a very rich fossil heritage
and is notable for the abundance of well-preserved dinosaur
skeletons; they are remarkably easy to ﬁnd because their white
fossil bones stand out clearly against the soft, red sandstones in
which they are buried. Of even greater interest is the fact that the
most abundant of the dinosaurs preserved in these sandstones is
Protoceratops, which are approximately wolf-sized, and have a
prominent hooked beak and four legs terminated by sharp-clawed
toes. Their skulls also bear strikingly upswept bony frills, which
might easily be the origin of the wing-like structures that are often
depicted in Grifﬁn imagery (compare the images in Figure 3).
Grifﬁns were reported and ﬁgured very consistently for more
than a millennium, but beyond the 3rd century ad they became
deﬁned increasingly by allegorical traits. On this basis it would
appear to be highly probable that Grifﬁns owe their origin to
genuine observations of dinosaur skeletons made by nomadic
travellers through Mongolia; they demonstrate an uncanny link
between exotic mythological beasts and the real world of
dinosaurs.

3. The Grifﬁn of mythology exhibits all the key anatomical attributes of
Protoceratops, whose skeletons would have been observed by travellers
on the Silk Road through Mongolia

along with many other creatures, in a cataclysm following a giant
meteorite impact with Earth at that time (see Chapter 8).
Dinosaurs, as a group of animals of quite bewildering variety,
therefore existed on Earth for over 160 million years before their
sudden demise. This surely puts the span of human existence, and
our current dominance of this fragile planet (in particular, the
debates concerning our utilization of resources, pollution, and
global warming), into a decidedly sobering perspective.

Dinosaurs are undeniably interesting to many people. Their very
existence incites curiosity, and this can be used in some instances as
a means of introducing unsuspecting audiences to the excitement of
scientiﬁc discovery and the application and use of science more
generally. Just as fascination with bird songs could lead to an
interest in the physics of sound transmission, echolocation, and
ultimately radar, on the one hand, or linguistics and psychology
on the other; so it can be that an interest in dinosaurs can open
pathways into an equally surprising and unexpectedly wide range of
scientiﬁc disciplines. Outlining some of these pathways into science
is one of the underlying purposes of this book.
Palaeontology is the science that has been built around the study of
fossils, the remains of organisms that died prior to the time when
human culture began to have an identiﬁable impact on the world,
that is more than 10,000 years ago. This branch of science
represents our attempt to bring such fossils back to life: not literally,
as in resuscitating dead creatures (in the ﬁctional Jurassic Park

Introduction

The very fact of the recognition of dinosaurs, and the very different
world in which they lived, today is a testament to the extraordinary
explanatory power of science. The ability to be inquisitive, to probe
the natural world and all its products, and to keep asking that
beguilingly simple question – why? – is one of the essences of being
human. It is hardly surprising that developing rigorous methods in
order to determine answers to such general questions is at the core
of all science.

mode), but by using science to understand as fully as we can what
such creatures were really like and how they ﬁtted into their
world. When a fossil of an animal is discovered, it presents the
palaeontologist with a series of puzzles, not unlike those faced by
the ﬁctional sleuth Sherlock Holmes:

Dinosaurs

What type of creature was it when it was alive?
How long ago did it die?
Did it die naturally of old age, or was it killed?
Did it die just where it was found, buried in the rock, or was its body
moved here from somewhere else?
Was it male or female?
How did the creature look when it was alive?
Was it colourful or drab?
Was it fast-moving or a slow-coach?
What did it eat?
How well could it see, smell, or hear?
Is it related to any creatures that are alive today?

These are just a few examples of the questions that might be asked,
but all tend towards the piecemeal reconstruction of a picture of
the creature and of the world in which it lived. It has been my
experience, following on from the ﬁrst broadcasting of the
television series called Walking with Dinosaurs, with their
incredibly realistic-looking virtual dinosaurs, that many people
were sufﬁciently intrigued by what they saw or heard in the
commentary to ask: ‘How did you know that they moved like
that? . . . looked like that? . . . behaved like that?’
Questions driven by uncomplicated observations and basic
common sense underpin this book. Every fossil discovery is in and
of itself unique and has the potential to teach the inquisitive among
us something about our heritage as members of our world. I should,
however, qualify this statement by adding that the particular type of
heritage that I will be discussing relates to the natural heritage that
we share with all other organisms on this planet. This natural
8

heritage spans a period of time that exceeds 3,800 million years
according to most modern estimates. I will be exploring only a tiny
section of this staggeringly long period of time: just that interval
between 225 and 65 million years ago, when dinosaurs dominated
most aspects of life on Earth.

Introduction

Chapter 1
Dinosaurs in perspective

The fossilized remains of dinosaurs (with the notable exception of
their lineal descendants the birds – see Chapter 6) have been found
in rocks identiﬁed as belonging to the Mesozoic Era. Mesozoic rocks
range in age from 245 to 65 million years ago (abbreviated to Ma
from now on). In order to put the time during which dinosaurs lived
into context, since such numbers are so large as to be quite literally
unimaginable, it is simpler to refer the reader to the geological
timescale (Figure 4).
During the 19th and a considerable part of the 20th centuries, the
age of the Earth, and the relative ages of the different rocks of which
it is composed, had been the subject of intense scrutiny. During the
early part of the 19th century it was becoming recognized (though
not without dispute) that the rocks of the Earth, and the fossils that
they contained, could be divided into qualitatively different types.
There were rocks that appeared to contain no fossils (often referred
to as igneous, or ‘basement’). Positioned above these apparently
lifeless basement rocks was a sequence of four types of rocks that
signiﬁed four ages of the Earth. During much of the 19th century
these were named Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary –
quite literally the ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth ages. The ones that
contained traces of ancient shelled and simple ﬁsh-like creatures
were ‘Primary’ (now more commonly called Palaeozoic, literally
indicative of ‘ancient life’). Above the palaeozoics was a sequence of
10

rocks that contained a combination of shells, ﬁsh, and land-living
saurians (or ‘crawlers’, which today would include amphibians
and reptiles); these rocks were designated broadly as ‘Secondary’
(nowadays Mesozoic, ‘middle life’). Above the mesozoics were found
rocks that contain creatures more similar to those living today,
notably because they include mammals and birds; these were
named ‘Tertiary’ (now also called Cenozoic, ‘recent life’). And ﬁnally,
there was the ‘Quaternary’ (or Recent) that charted the appearance
of recognizably modern plants and animals and the inﬂuence of the
great ice ages.

The part of the timescale that we are most concerned with in this
book is the Mesozoic Era, comprising three geological periods:
the Triassic (245–200 Ma), the Jurassic (200–144 Ma), and the
Cretaceous (144–65 Ma). Note that these periods of time are not by
any means equal in duration. Geologists were not able to identify a
metronome-like tick of the clock measuring the passing of Earth
time. The boundaries between the periods were mapped out in the
last two centuries by geologists who were able to deﬁne particular
rock types and, very often, their constituent fossils, and this is
usually reﬂected in the names chosen for the periods. The term
‘Triassic’ originates from a triplet of distinctive rock types
(known as the Lias, Malm, and Dogger); the ‘Jurassic’ hails from
a sequence of rocks identiﬁed in the Jura Mountains of France;
while the name ‘Cretaceous’ was chosen to reﬂect the great
thickness of chalk (known as Kreta in Greek) such as that which
11

This general pattern has stood the test of time remarkably well.
All modern geological timescales continue to recognize these
relatively crude, but fundamental, subdivisions: Paleozoic,
Mesozoic, Cenozoic, Recent. However, reﬁnements in the way
the fossil record can be examined for example, through the use
of high-resolution microscopy, the identiﬁcation of chemical
signatures associated with life, and the more accurate dating of
rocks enabled by radioactive isotope techniques have led to a more
precise timescale of Earth history.

forms the White Cliffs of Dover and is found widely across Eurasia
and North America.
The earliest dinosaurs known have been identiﬁed in rocks dated
at 225 Ma, from the close of the Triassic (a period known as the
Carnian), in Argentina and Madagascar. Rather disconcertingly,
these earliest remains are not rare, solitary examples of one type of
creature: the common ancestor of all later dinosaurs. To date at
least four, possibly ﬁve, different creatures have been identiﬁed:
three meat-eaters (Eoraptor, Herrerasaurus, and Staurikosaurus),
a tantalizingly incomplete plant-eater named Pisanosaurus, and an
as-yet-unnamed omnivore. One conclusion is obvious: these are not
the earliest dinosaurs. In the Carnian there was clearly a diversity of
early dinosaurs. This indicates that there must have been dinosaurs
living in the Middle Triassic (Ladinian-Anisian) that had ‘fathered’
the Carnian diversity. So we know for a fact that the story of
dinosaur origins, both the time and the place, is incomplete.

Why dinosaur fossils are rare
It is important, at the outset, for the reader to realize that the fossil
record is incomplete and, perhaps more worryingly, decidedly
patchy. The incompleteness is a product of the process of
fossilization. Dinosaurs were all land-living (terrestrial) animals,
which poses particular problems. To appreciate this, it is necessary
ﬁrst to consider the case of a shelled creature living in the sea, such
as an oyster. In the shallow seas where oysters live today, their
fossilization potential is quite high. They are living on, or attached
to, the seabed and are subjected to a constant ‘drizzle’ of small
particles (sediment), including decaying planktonic organisms,
silt or mud, and sand grains. If an oyster should die, its soft tissues
would rot or be scavenged by other organisms quite quickly and its
hard shell would be gradually buried under ﬁne sediment. Once
buried, the shell has the potential to become a fossil as it becomes
trapped under an increasingly thick layer of sediment. Over
thousands or millions of years, the sediment in which the shell was
14

5. The meat-eating dinosaur Herrerasaurus

Dinosaurs

buried is gradually compressed to form a silty sandstone, and this
may become cemented or lithiﬁed (literally, turned to stone) by
the deposition of calcium carbonate (calcite) or silica (chert/ﬂint)
carried through the fabric of the rock by percolating water. For the
fossil remains of the original oyster to be discovered, the deeply
buried rock would need to be lifted, by earth movements, to form
dry land, and then subjected to the normal processes of weathering
and erosion.
Land-living creatures, by contrast, have a far lower probability of
becoming fossilized. Any animal dying on land is likely, of course, to
have its soft, ﬂeshy remains scavenged and recycled; however, for
such a creature to be preserved as a fossil it would need to be subject
to some form of burial. In rare circumstances creatures may be
buried rapidly in drifting dune sand, a mud-slide, under volcanic
ash, or some by other catastrophic event. However, in the majority
of cases the remains of land animals need to be washed into a
nearby stream or river, and eventually ﬁnd their way into a lake or
seabed where the process of slow burial, leading to fossilization,
can commence. In simple, probabilistic terms the pathway to
fossilization for any land creature is that much longer, and fraught
with greater hazard. Many animals that die on land are scavenged
and their remains become entirely scattered so that even their hard
parts are recycled into the biosphere; others have their skeletons
scattered, so that only broken fragments actually complete the path
to eventual burial, leaving tantalizing glimpses of creatures; only
very rarely will major parts, or even whole skeletons, be preserved
in their entirety.
So, logic dictates that dinosaur skeletons (as with any land-living
animal) should be extremely rare and so they are, despite the
impression sometimes given by the media.
The discovery of dinosaurs and their appearance within the fossil
record is also a decidedly patchy business, for rather mundane
reasons. Fossil preservation is, as we have just come to appreciate, a
16

chance-laden, rather than design-driven, process. The discovery of
fossils is similarly serendipitous in the sense that outcrops of rocks
are not neatly arranged like the pages of a book to be sampled
perhaps in sequence, or as fancy takes us.

Searching for dinosaurs
From the very outset, we need to approach the search for dinosaurs
systematically. On the basis of what we have learned so far, it is ﬁrst
necessary to check where to ﬁnd rocks of the appropriate age by
17

Dinosaurs in perspective

The relatively brittle surface layers of the Earth (its crust, in
geological terms) have been buckled, torn, and crumpled by huge
geological forces acting over tens or hundreds of millions of years
that have wrenched landmasses apart or crushed them together. As
a result, the geological strata containing fossils have been broken,
thrown up, and frequently destroyed completely by the process of
erosion throughout geological time, and further confused by later
periods of renewed sedimentation. What we, as palaeontologists,
are left with is an extremely complex ‘battleﬁeld’, pitted, cratered,
and broken in a bewildering variety of ways. Disentangling this
‘mess’ has been the work of countless generations of ﬁeld geologists.
Outcrops here, cliff-sections there, have been studied and slowly
assembled into the jigsaw that is the geological structure of the
land. As a result, it is now possible to identify rocks of Mesozoic age
(belonging to the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods) with
some accuracy in any country in the world. However, that is not
sufﬁcient to aid the search for dinosaurs. It is also necessary to
disregard Mesozoic rocks laid down on the sea ﬂoor, such as the
thick chalk deposits of the Cretaceous and the abundant limestones
of the Jurassic. The best types of rocks to search in for dinosaur
fossils are those that were laid down as shallow coastal or estuarine
environments; these might have trapped the odd, bloated carcasses
of land-living creatures washed out to sea. But best of all are river
and lake sediments, environments that were physically much closer
to the source of land creatures.

consulting geological maps of the country that is of interest. It is
equally important to ensure that the rocks are of a type that is
at least likely to preserve the remains of land animals; so some
geological knowledge is required in order to predict the likelihood
of ﬁnding dinosaur fossils, especially when visiting an area for the
ﬁrst time.

Dinosaurs

Mostly, this involves developing a familiarity with rocks and their
appearance in the area being investigated; this is rather similar to
the way in which a hunter needs to study intently the terrain in
which the prey lives. It also requires the development of an ‘eye’ for
fossils, which comes simply from looking until fossil fragments are
eventually recognized, and this takes time.
Discovery provides the adrenaline-rush of excitement, but is also
the time when the discoverer needs to be most circumspect. All too
often fossil discoveries have been ruined, scientiﬁcally speaking, in
the frantic rush to dig the specimen up, so that it can be displayed
by its proud ﬁnder. Such impatience can result in great damage to
the fossil itself. Even worse, the object might be part of a larger
skeleton that might be far more proﬁtably excavated carefully by a
larger team of trained palaeontologists. And, as the sleuth might
point out, the rocks in which the fossil was embedded may also have
important tales to tell concerning the circumstances under which
the animal died and was buried, in addition to the more obvious
information concerning the actual geological age of the specimen.
The search for, and discovery of, fossils can be a personally exciting
adventure as well as a technically fascinating process. However,
ﬁnding fossils is just the beginning of a process of scientiﬁc
investigation that can lead to an understanding of the biology
and way of life of the fossilized creature and the world in which it
once lived. In this latter respect, the science of palaeontology
exhibits some similarities to the work of the forensic pathologist:
both clearly share an intense interest in understanding the
circumstances surrounding the discovery of a body, and use science
18

to interpret and understand as many of the clues as possible in an
effort to leave, quite literally, no stone unturned.

Dinosaur discovery: Iguanodon

The story of Iguanodon covers almost the entire history of scientiﬁc
research on dinosaurs and also the entire history of the science
now known as palaeontology. As a result, this animal unwittingly
illustrates the progress of scientiﬁc investigation on dinosaurs
(and other areas of palaeontology) during the past 200 years. The
story also reveals scientists as human beings, with passions and
struggles, and the pervasive inﬂuence of pet theories at times in
the history of the subject.
The ﬁrst bona ﬁde records of the fossil bones that were later to
be named Iguanodon date back to 1809. They comprise, among
indeterminable broken fragments of vertebrae, the lower end of a
large, very distinctive tibia (shin bone) collected from a quarry at
Cuckﬁeld in Sussex (Figure 6). This particular fossil was collected
by William Smith (often referred to as the ‘father of English
geology’). Smith was then researching the ﬁrst geological map of
Britain, which he completed in 1815. Although these fossil bones
were clearly sufﬁciently interesting to have been collected and
19

Dinosaurs in perspective

Once you have found your fossil, it needs to be studied scientiﬁcally
in order to reveal its identity, its relationship to other known
organisms, as well as more detailed aspects of its appearance,
biology, and ecology. To illustrate a few of the trials and tribulations
inherent in any such programme of palaeontological investigation,
we will examine a rather familiar and well-studied dinosaur:
Iguanodon. This dinosaur has been chosen because it has an
interesting and appropriate story to tell, and one with which I am
familiar, because it proved to be the unexpected starting point
for my career as a palaeontologist. Serendipity seems to have a
signiﬁcant role to play in palaeontology, and this is certainly true
for my own work.

6. The ﬁrst Iguanodon bone ever collected, by William Smith at
Cuckﬁeld in Sussex, in 1809

preserved (they are still in the collections of the Natural History
Museum, London), no further study was made of them. The bones
languished unrecognized until I was asked to establish their
identity in the late 1970s.

Following the defeat of Napoleon and the restoration of peace
between England and France, Cuvier was ﬁnally able to visit
England in 1817–18 and meet scientists with similar interests. At
Oxford he was shown some gigantic fossil bones in the collections
of the geologist William Buckland; these seemed to belong to
a gigantic, but this time land-living, lizard-like creature, and
they reminded Cuvier of similar bones that had been found in
21

Dinosaurs in perspective

Yet 1809 was a remarkably opportune moment for such a discovery
to be made. Things were happening in Europe in the branch of
science concerned with fossils and their meaning. One of the
greatest and most inﬂuential scientists of this age, Georges
Cuvier (1769–1832), was a ‘naturalist’ working in Paris and
an administrator in the Emperor Napoleon’s government.
‘Naturalist’ was, in these times, a broad category denoting the
philosopher-scientist who worked on a wide range of subjects
associated with the natural world: the Earth, its rocks and minerals,
fossils, and all living organisms. In 1808, Cuvier redescribed a
renowned gigantic fossil reptile collected from a chalk quarry at
Maastricht in Holland; its renown stemmed from the fact that it
had been claimed as a trophy of war during the siege of Maastricht
in 1795 by Napoleon’s army. The creature, originally mistaken for a
crocodile, was identiﬁed correctly by Cuvier as an enormous marine
lizard (later named Mosasaurus by the English cleric and naturalist
the Revd William D. Conybeare). The effect of this revelation – the
existence of an unexpectedly gigantic fossil lizard of a former time
in Earth history – was truly profound. It encouraged the search for,
and discovery of, other giant extinct ‘lizards’; it established, beyond
reasonable doubt, that pre-biblical ‘earlier worlds’ had existed; and
it also determined a particular way of viewing and interpreting such
fossil creatures: as gigantic lizards.

Dinosaurs

Normandy. William Buckland eventually named this creature
Megalosaurus in 1824 (with a little help from Conybeare).
However, from the perspective of this particular story, the really
important discoveries were not made until around 1821–2 and at
the same quarries, around Whiteman’s Green in Cuckﬁeld, visited
by William Smith some 13 years earlier. At this time, an energetic
and ambitious medical doctor, Gideon Algernon Mantell
(1790–1852), living in the town of Lewes, was dedicating all his
spare time to completing a detailed report on the geological
structure and fossils in his native Weald district (an area
incorporating much of Surrey, Sussex, and part of Kent) in
southern England. His work culminated in an impressively large,
well-illustrated book that he published in 1822. Included in this
book were clear descriptions of several unusual, large reptilian teeth
and ribs that he had been unable to identify properly. Several of
these teeth were purchased by Mantell from quarrymen, while
others had been collected by his wife, Mary Ann. The next three
years saw Mantell struggling to identify the type of animal to which
these large fossil teeth might have belonged. Although not trained
in comparative anatomy (the particular specialism of Cuvier), he
developed contacts with many learned men in England in the hope
of gaining some insight into the afﬁnity of his fossils; he also sent
some of his precious specimens to Cuvier in Paris for identiﬁcation.
At ﬁrst, Mantell’s discoveries were dismissed, even by Cuvier, as
fragments of Recent animals (perhaps the incisor teeth of a
rhinoceros, or those of large, coral-chewing, bony ﬁsh). Undeterred,
Mantell continued to investigate his problem, and ﬁnally found a
likely solution. In the collections of the Royal College of Surgeons in
London he was shown the skeleton of an iguana, a herbivorous
lizard that had recently been discovered in South America. The
teeth were similar in general shape to those of his fossils and
indicated to Mantell that they belonged to an extinct, herbivorous,
giant relative of the living iguana. Mantell published a report on the
new discovery in 1825 and the name chosen for this fossil creature
was, perhaps not surprisingly, Iguanodon. The name means, quite
22

7. One of the original Iguanodon teeth found by the Mantells

literally, ‘iguana tooth’ and was created yet again, at the suggestion
of Conybeare (clearly the latter’s classical training and turn of mind
gave him a natural facility in the naming of many of these early
discoveries).

Dinosaurs

Not surprisingly, given the comparisons then available, these early
discoveries conﬁrmed the existence of an ancient world inhabited
by improbably large lizards. For example, a simple scaling of the
minute teeth of the living (metre-long) iguana with those of
Mantell’s Iguanodon yielded a body length in excess of 25 metres.
The excitement, and personal fame, engendered by the description
of Iguanodon drove Mantell to greater efforts to discover more
about this animal and the fossil inhabitants of the ancient Weald.
For several years after 1825, only fragments of Weald fossils
were discovered; then, in 1834, a partial, disarticulated skeleton
(Figure 8) was discovered at a quarry in Maidstone, Kent.
Eventually purchased for Mantell, and christened the
‘Mantel-piece’, it proved to be the inspiration behind much of
his later work and resulted in some of the ﬁrst visualizations of
dinosaurs ever produced (Figure 9). He continued probing the
anatomy and biology of Iguanodon in his later years, but much of
this was, alas, overshadowed by the rise of an extremely able,
well-connected, ambitious, and ruthless personal nemesis:
Richard Owen (1804–1892) (see Figure 1).

The ‘invention’ of dinosaurs
Fourteen years younger than Mantell, Richard Owen also studied
medicine, but concentrated in particular on anatomy. He gained a
reputation as a skilled anatomist, and acquired a position at the
Royal College of Surgeons in London, which gave him access to
a great deal of comparative material and, through considerable
industry and skill, allowed him to foster a reputation as the ‘English
Cuvier’. During the late 1830s, he was able to persuade the British
Association to grant him money to prepare a detailed review of all

that was then known of British fossil reptiles. This eventually
resulted in the publication of a stream of large, well-illustrated
volumes that would mimic the hugely important works (notably
the multi–volume Ossemens Fossiles) published by Cuvier
earlier in the century, and further cemented Owen’s scientiﬁc
reputation.

In reviewing each dinosaur in turn, Owen trimmed their
dimensions considerably, suggesting that they were large, but in the

Dinosaurs in perspective

This project resulted in two important publications: one in 1840 on
mostly marine fossils (Conybeare’s Enaliosauria) and another in
1842 on the remainder, including Mantell’s Iguanodon. The 1842
report is a remarkable document because of Owen’s invention of
the new ‘tribe or sub-order . . . which I . . . name . . . Dinosauria’.
Owen identiﬁed three dinosaurs in this report: Iguanodon and
Hylaeosaurus, both discovered in the Weald and named by
Mantell; and Megalosaurus, the giant reptile from Oxford.
He recognized dinosaurs as members of a unique and hitherto
unrecognized group on the basis of several detailed and distinctive
anatomical observations. These included the enlarged sacrum
(a remarkably strong attachment of the hips to the spinal column),
the double-headed ribs in the chest region, and the pillar-like
construction of the legs (see Figure 10).

region of 9 to 12 metres, rather than the more dramatic lengths
suggested by Cuvier, Mantell, and Buckland on previous occasions.
Furthermore, Owen speculated a little more on the anatomy and
biology of these animals in words that have an extraordinary
resonance in the light of today’s interpretations of the biology
and way of life of dinosaurs.
Among his concluding remarks in the report, he observed that
dinosaurs:
attained the greatest bulk, and must have played the most
conspicuous parts, in their respective characters as devourers of
animals and feeders upon vegetables, that this earth has ever
witnessed in oviparous [egg-laying] and cold-blooded creatures.

Dinosaurs

(Owen 1842: 200)

And also that:
The Dinosaurs having the same thoracic structure as the Crocodile,
may be concluded to have possessed a four-chambered heart . . .
more nearly approaching that which now characterizes the warmblooded Mammalia.
(ibid.: 204)

Owen’s conception was therefore one of very stout, but egg-laying
and scaly (because they were still reptiles) creatures resembling the
largest mammals to be found in the tropical regions of the Earth
today; his dinosaurs were in effect the crowning glory of a time
on Earth when egg-laying and scaly-skinned reptiles reigned
supreme. Owen’s dinosaurs were the ancient world’s equivalents of
present-day elephants, rhinos, and hippos. Looked at purely from
the logic of scientiﬁc deduction, based on such meagre remains, this
was not only brilliantly incisive, but an altogether revolutionary
vision of creatures from the ancient past. Such breathtaking vision
is all the more remarkable when it is juxtaposed to the ‘gigantic
lizard’ models, though these were entirely reasonable and logical
28

interpretations built on established and respected Cuvierian
principles of comparative anatomy.

Dinosaurs, and indeed several of the groups of organisms
recognized in the God-fearing Owen’s reports, provided evidence
that life on Earth did not demonstrate an increase in complexity
over time – in fact quite the reverse. Dinosaurs were anatomically
reptiles (that is to say, members of the general group of egg-laying,
cold-blooded, scaly vertebrates); however, the reptiles living today
were a degenerate group of creatures when compared to Owen’s
magniﬁcent dinosaurs that had lived during Mesozoic times. In
short, Owen was attempting to strangle the radical, scientiﬁcally
driven intellectualism of the time in order to re-establish an
understanding of the diversity of life that had its basis closer to the
views espoused by Reverend William Paley in his book entitled
Natural Theology in which God held centre-stage as the Creator
and Architect of all Nature’s creatures.
Owen’s fame grew steadily through the 1840s and 1850s, and he
29

Dinosaurs in perspective

The creation of the Dinosauria had other important purposes at the
time. The reports also offered a sweeping refutation of the general
progressionist and transmutationist movements within the ﬁelds
of biology and geology during the ﬁrst half of the 19th century.
Progressionists noted that the fossil record seemed to show that life
had become progressively more complex: the earliest rocks showed
the simplest forms of life, while more recent rocks showed evidence
of more complex creatures. Transmutationists noted that members
of one species were not identical and pondered whether this
variability might also allow species to change over time. Jean
Baptiste de Lamarck, a colleague of Cuvier in Paris, had suggested
that animal species might transmute, or change, in form over time
through the inheritance of acquired characteristics. These ideas
challenged the widely held, biblically inspired belief that God had
created all creatures on Earth, and were being widely and
acrimoniously discussed.

Dinosaurs

became involved in the committees associated with the planning of
the relocated Great Exhibition of 1854. It is a curious fact that
Owen, for all his burgeoning fame, was not ﬁrst choice as the
scientiﬁc director for the construction of the dinosaurs – Gideon
Mantell was. Mantell refused on the grounds of persistent
ill-health, and also because he was exceedingly wary of the risks
associated with popularizing scientiﬁc work, particularly the risk of
misrepresentating imperfectly developed ideas.
Mantell’s story ended in tragedy: his obsession with fossils and
the development of a personal museum led to the collapse of his
medical practice, and his family disintegrated (his wife left him and
his surviving children emigrated once they were old enough to leave
home). The diary that he kept for much of his life makes melancholy
reading; in his ﬁnal years he was left lonely and racked by chronic
back pain, and he died of a self-administered overdose of
laudanum.
Although outﬂanked by the ambitious, brilliant, and crucially
full-time, scientist Owen, Mantell spent much of the last decade
of his life continuing research on ‘his’ Iguanodon. He produced
a series of scientiﬁc articles and extremely popular books
summarizing many of his new discoveries, and he was the ﬁrst to
realize (in 1851) that Owen’s vision of the dinosaurs (or at least
Iguanodon) as stout ‘elephantine reptiles’ was probably wrong.
Further discoveries of jaws with teeth, and further analysis of the
partial skeleton (the ‘Mantel-piece’), revealed that Iguanodon had
strong back legs and smaller, weaker front limbs. As a result, he
concluded that its posture may have had much more in common
with the ‘upright’ reconstructions of giant ground sloths
(paradoxically inspired by Owen’s detailed description of the fossil
ground sloth Mylodon). Unfortunately, this work was overlooked,
largely because of the excitement and publicity surrounding Owen’s
Crystal Palace dinosaur models. The truth of Mantell’s suspicions,
and the strength of his own intellect, were not to be revealed for a
further 30 years, and through another amazing piece of serendipity.
30

Reconstructing Iguanodon
In 1878 remarkable discoveries were made at a coal mine in the
small village of Bernissart in Belgium. The colliers, who were mining
a coal seam over 300 metres beneath the surface, suddenly struck a
seam of shale (soft, laminated clay) and began to ﬁnd what
appeared to be large pieces of fossil wood; these were eagerly
collected because they seemed to be ﬁlled with gold! On closer
inspection, the wood turned out to be fossil bone, and the gold
‘fool’s gold’ (iron pyrites). A few fossil teeth were also discovered
among the bones, and these were identiﬁed as similar to those
described as belonging to Iguanodon by Mantell many years before.
The miners had accidentally discovered not gold, but a veritable
treasure trove of complete dinosaur skeletons.

11. Louis Dollo (1857–1931)
31

Dinosaurs in perspective

Over the next ﬁve years, a team of miners and scientists from the
Royal Belgian Museum of Natural History in Brussels (now the

Royal Institute of Natural Sciences) excavated nearly 40 skeletons
of the dinosaur Iguanodon, as well as a huge number of other
animals and plants whose remains were preserved in the same
shales. Many of the dinosaur skeletons were complete and fully
articulated; they represented the most spectacular discovery that
had been made anywhere in the world at the time. It was the good
fortune of a young scientist in Brussels, Louis Dollo (1857–1931), to
be able to study and describe these extraordinary riches, and this he
did from 1882 until his retirement in the 1920s.

Dinosaurs

The complete dinosaur skeletons unearthed in Bernissart proved
ﬁnally that Owen’s model of dinosaurs such as Iguanodon was
incorrect. As Mantell had suspected, the front limbs were not as
large and strong as the back legs, while the animal had a massive
tail (see Figure 12), and the overall proportions of a giant kangaroo.
The skeletal restoration, and the process by which it was arrived at,
are particularly revealing because they show how the inﬂuence of

12. Drawing of an Iguanodon skeleton
32

the contemporary interpretations about the appearance and
afﬁnities of dinosaurs affected Dollo’s work. Owen’s ‘elephantine
reptile’ vision of the dinosaur had been questioned as early as 1859
by some tantalizingly incomplete dinosaur discoveries made in New
Jersey and studied by Joseph Leidy, a man of equivalent scientiﬁc
stature to Owen who was based at the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences. However, Owen was to be far more roundly
criticized by a younger, London-based, and ambitious rival:
Thomas Henry Huxley (1825–95).

Not long after the discovery of Archaeopteryx, another small,
well-preserved skeleton was found in the same quarries in Germany
(Figure 14). It bore no feather impressions and its arms were far
too short to have served as wings in any case; anatomically, it was
clearly a small, predatory dinosaur and was named Compsognathus
(‘pretty jaw’).
These two discoveries emerged at a particularly sensitive time
scientiﬁcally speaking. In 1859, just a year or so before the ﬁrst
skeleton of Archaeopteryx was unearthed, Charles Darwin
published a book entitled On the Origin of Species. This book
33

Dinosaurs in perspective

By the late 1860s, a series of new discoveries had been made that
added considerably to the debate over the relationships of dinosaurs
to other animals. The earliest well-preserved fossil bird (called
Archaeopteryx, or ‘ancient wing’) had been discovered in Germany
(Figure 13). It was eventually bought from its private collector
by the Natural History Museum in London, and described by
Richard Owen in 1863. The specimen was unusual in that it had
well-preserved impressions of feathers, the key identiﬁer for any
bird, forming a halo in the matrix around its skeleton; however,
unlike any living bird, and rather disconcertingly similar to modern
reptiles, it also had three long ﬁngers ending in sharp claws on each
hand, teeth in its jaws, and a long bony tail (some living birds might
seem to have long tails, but this is just the proﬁle of their feathers
that are anchored in a short remnant of the tail).

13. A well preserved Archaeopteryx specimen, discovered in 1876
(approx 40 cm long)

provided a very detailed discussion of the evidence in favour of
the ideas being put forward by the transmutationists and
progressionists referred to earlier. Most importantly, Darwin
suggested a mechanism – natural selection – by which such
transmutations might occur and how new species appear on Earth.
The book was sensational at the time because it offered a direct
challenge to the almost universally accepted authority of biblical
teachings by suggesting that God did not directly create all the

Dinosaurs in perspective

14. Compsognathus skeleton (approx 70 cm long)

species known in the world. Darwin’s ideas were vigorously
opposed by pious establishment ﬁgures such as Richard Owen.
In contrast, the radical intellectuals reacted very positively to
Darwin’s ideas. Thomas Huxley is reputed to have declared, after
reading Darwin’s book, ‘How very stupid of me not to have thought
of that!’
35

Dinosaurs

While not wishing to become too involved in Darwinian matters, it
is nevertheless the case that dinosaurian discoveries featured
in some of the arguments. Huxley was quick to realize that
Archaeopteryx and the small predatory dinosaur Compsognathus
were anatomically very similar. By the early 1870s, Huxley was
proposing that birds and dinosaurs were not only anatomically
similar, but used this evidence to support the theory that birds had
evolved from dinosaurs. In many ways, the stage was set for the
discoveries in Belgium. By the late 1870s, Louis Dollo, as a bright
young student, would have been fully aware of the Owen–Huxley/
Darwin feuds. One burning question must have been: did these new
discoveries have any bearing on the great scientiﬁc controversy of
the day?
Careful anatomical study of the full skeleton of Iguanodon revealed
that it had a hip structure known as ornithischian (‘bird-hipped’);
furthermore, it had long back legs that ended in massive, but
decidedly bird-like, three-toed feet (very similar in shape to the feet
of some of the biggest known land-living birds such as emus). This
dinosaur also had a rather bird-like curved neck, and the tips of its
upper and lower jaws were toothless and covered by, yet again, a
bird-like horny beak or bill. Given the task of description and
interpretation faced by Dollo in the immediate aftermath of these
exciting discoveries, it is intriguing to note that, in the early
photographs taken at the time of the reconstruction of the ﬁrst
skeleton in Brussels, just beside the huge dinosaur skeleton can be
seen skeletons of two Australian creatures: a wallaby (a small
variety of kangaroo) and a large, ﬂightless bird known as a
cassowary.
The inﬂuence of the debate raging in England cannot be doubted.
This new discovery pointed to the truth implicit in Huxley’s
arguments and made it clear that Mantell had been on the right
track in 1851. Iguanodon was no lumbering, scaly rhinoceros
lookalike as portrayed by Owen in his grand models of 1854; rather
it was a huge creature with a pose similar to that of a resting
36

15. Iguanodon being reconstructed at the Museum of Natural History,

comparison.

Dinosaurs

kangaroo, but with a number of bird-like attributes, just as Huxley’s
theory predicted.
Dollo proved to be tirelessly inventive in his approach to the fossil
creatures that he described – he dissected crocodiles and birds in
order to better understand the biology and detailed musculature of
these animals and how it could be used to identify the soft tissues
of his dinosaurs. In many respects, he was adopting a decidedly
forensic approach to understanding those mysterious fossils. Dollo
was regarded as the architect of a new style of palaeontology that
became known as palaeobiology. Dollo demonstrated that
palaeontology should be expanded to investigate the biology, and by
implication ecology and behaviour, of these extinct creatures. His
ﬁnal contribution to the Iguanodon story was a paper he published
in 1923 to honour the centenary of Mantell’s original discoveries.
He succinctly summarized his views on the dinosaur, identifying it
as the dinosaurian ecological equivalent of the giraffe (or indeed
Mantell’s giant ground sloth). Dollo concluded that its posture
enabled it to reach high into trees to gather its fodder, which it was
able to draw into its mouth by using a long, muscular tongue; the
sharp beak was used to nip off tough stems, while the characteristic
teeth served to pulp the food before it was swallowed. So ﬁrmly
was this authoritative interpretation adopted, based as it was on a
set of complete articulated skeletons, that it stood, literally and
metaphorically, unchallenged for the next 60 years. This was
reinforced by the distribution of replica, mounted skeletons
of Iguanodon from Brussels to many of the great museums
around the world during the early years of the 20th century,
and also by the many popular and inﬂuential textbooks written
on the subject.

Dinosaur palaeontology in decline
Paradoxically, the culmination of Dollo’s remarkable work on this
dinosaur and his international recognition as the ‘father’ of the new
palaeobiology in the 1920s marked the beginning of a serious
38

decline in the perceived relevance of this area of research within
the larger theatre of natural science.

Equally fascinating discoveries were made, partly by accident,
during the early 20th century in exotic places such as Mongolia
by Roy Chapman Andrews of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York (the real-life hero/explorer upon whom was
based the mythical ‘Indiana Jones’); and in German East Africa
(Tanzania) by Werner Janensch of the Berlin Museum of Natural
History.
More new dinosaurs were continually being discovered and named
from various places around the world, and although they created
dramatic centrepieces in museums, palaeontologists seemed to be
doing little more than adding new names to the roster of extinct
creatures. A sense of failure took hold to the extent that some even
used dinosaurs as examples of a theory of extinction based on ‘racial
senescence’. The general thesis was that they had lived for so long
that their genetic constitution was simply exhausted and no longer
39

Dinosaurs in perspective

In the interval between the mid-1920s and the mid-1960s,
palaeontology, and particularly the study of dinosaurs, rather
unexpectedly stagnated. The excitement of the early discoveries,
notably those in Europe, was succeeded by more the spectacular
‘bone wars’ that gripped America during the last three decades of
the 19th century. These centred on a furious – and sometimes
violent – race to discover and name new dinosaurs, and had all the
hallmarks of an academic equivalent of the ‘Wild West’. At its centre
were Edward Drinker Cope (a protégé of the polite and unassuming
Professor Leidy) and his ‘opponent’ Othniel Charles Marsh at Yale
University. They hired gangs of thugs to venture out into the
American mid-West to collect as many new dinosaur bones as
possible. This ‘war’ resulted in a frenzy of scientiﬁc publications
naming dozens of new dinosaurs, many of whose names still
resonate today, such as Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops,
and Diplodocus.

capable of generating the novelty necessary for the group as a whole
to survive. This supported the idea that dinosaurs were merely an
experiment in animal design and evolution that the world had
eventually passed by.

Dinosaurs

Not surprisingly, many biologists and theoreticians began to view
this area of research with an increasingly jaundiced eye. New
discoveries, though undeniably exciting, did not seem to be
providing data that would lead in any particular direction.
Discovery required the scientiﬁc formalities of description and
naming of these creatures, but beyond that all interest seemed
essentially museological: to be brutal, the work was seen as the
equivalent of ‘stamp collecting’. Dinosaurs, and many other fossil
discoveries, offered glimpses of the tapestry of life within the fossil
record, but beyond this their scientiﬁc value seemed questionable.
Several factors justiﬁed this change of perception: Gregor Mendel’s
work (published in 1866, but overlooked until 1900) on the laws of
particulate inheritance (genetics) provided the crucial mechanism
to support Darwin’s theory of evolution by means of natural
selection. Mendel’s work was elegantly merged with Darwin’s
theory in order to create ‘Neodarwinism’ in the 1930s. At a stroke,
Mendelian genetics solved one of Darwin’s most fundamental
worries about his theory: how favourable characteristics (genes
or alleles in the new Mendelian language) could be passed
from generation to generation. In the absence of any better
understanding of the mechanism of inheritance in the mid-19th
century, Darwin had assumed that characters or traits, the features
subject to selection according to his theory, were blended when
inherited by the next generation. This, however, was a fatal ﬂaw,
because Darwin realized that any favourable traits would simply be
diluted out of existence if they were blended during reproduction
from generation to generation. Neodarwinism clariﬁed matters
enormously, Mendelian genetics provided a degree of mathematical
rigour to the theory, and the revitalized subject rapidly spawned
new avenues of research. It led to the new sciences of genetics and
40

molecular biology, culminating in Crick and Watson’s model of
DNA in 1953, as well as huge developments in the ﬁelds of
behavioural evolution and evolutionary ecology.

Dinosaur palaeobiology: a new beginning
It was not until the 1960s and early 1970s that the study of fossils
began to re-emerge as the subject of wider and more general
interest. The catalyst for this re-awakening was a younger
generation of evolutionarily minded scientists eager to demonstrate
that the evidence from the fossil record was far from being a
Darwinian ‘closed book’. The premise that underpinned this
new work was that while evolutionary biologists are obviously
constrained by working with living animals in an essentially
two-dimensional world – they are able to study species, but they do
41

Dinosaurs in perspective

Unfortunately, this fertile intellectual ground was not so obviously
available to palaeontologists. Self-evidently, genetic mechanisms
could not be studied in fossil creatures, so it seemed that they could
offer no material evidence to the intellectual thrust of evolutionary
studies during much of the remainder of the 20th century. Darwin
had already foreseen the limitations of palaeontology in the context
of his new theory. Using his inimitable reasoning, he noted the
limited contribution that could be made by fossils to any of the
debates concerning his new evolutionary theory. In a chapter of
the Origin of Species devoted to the subject of the ‘imperfections
of the fossil record’, Darwin noted that although fossils provided
material proof of evolution during the history of life on Earth
(harking back to the older progressionists’ arguments), the
geological succession of rocks, and the fossil record contained
within in it, was lamentably incomplete. Comparing the geological
record to a book charting the history of life on Earth, he wrote:

Dinosaurs

not witness the emergence of new species – palaeobiologists, by
contrast, work in the third dimension of time. The fossil record
provides sufﬁcient time to allow new species to appear and others to
become extinct. This permits palaeobiologists to pose questions
that bear on the problems of evolution: does the geological
timescale offer an added (or different) perspective on the process of
evolution?; and, is the fossil record sufﬁciently informative that it
can be teased apart to reveal some evolutionary secrets?
Detailed surveys of the geological record began to demonstrate
rich successions of fossils (particularly shelled marine creatures) –
considerably richer than Charles Darwin could ever have imagined,
given the comparative infancy of palaeontological work in the
middle of the 19th century. Out of this work emerged observations
and theories that would challenge the views of biologists over the
modes of biological evolution over long intervals of geological
time. Sudden massive, worldwide extinction events and periods
of faunal recovery were documented which could not have been
predicted from Darwinian theory. Such events seemed to reset the
evolutionary timetable of life in a virtual instant, and this prompted
some theorists to take a much more ‘episodic’ or ‘contingent’ view
of the history of life on Earth. Large-scale, or macroevolutionary,
changes in global faunal diversity over time seemed to be
demonstrable; these again were not predicted from Darwinian
theory and required explanation.
Most notably, however, Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould
proposed the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’. They suggested
that modern biological versions of evolutionary theory needed to be
expanded, or modiﬁed, to accommodate patterns of change seen
repeatedly among species in the fossil record. These consisted of
prolonged periods of stasis (the ‘equilibrium’ period) during which
relatively minor changes in species were observable, and contrasted
with very short periods of rapid change (the ‘punctuation’). These
observations did not ﬁt well with the Darwinian prediction of slow
and progressive change in the appearance of species over time
42

(dubbed ‘evolutionary gradualism’). These ideas also prompted
palaeobiologists to question the levels at which natural selection
might function: perhaps it could operate above the level of the
individual in some instances?
As a consequence, the whole ﬁeld of palaeobiology became more
dynamic, questioning, and also outward-looking; it was also
prepared to integrate its work more broadly with other ﬁelds of
science. Even highly inﬂuential evolutionary biologists such as
John Maynard Smith, who had had little truck with fossils at all,
were prepared to accept that palaeobiology had valuable
contributions to make to the ﬁeld.

43

Dinosaurs in perspective

While the general ﬁeld of scientiﬁc palaeobiology was
re-establishing its credentials, the mid-1960s was also a time
of important new dinosaur discoveries; these were destined to
spark ideas that are still important today. The epicentre of this
renaissance was the Peabody Museum at Yale University, the
original workplace of ‘bone-ﬁghter’ Othniel Charles Marsh.
However, this time it was in the person of John Ostrom, a young
professor of palaeontology with a strong interest in dinosaurs.

Chapter 2
Dinosaur renaissance

The discovery of ‘terrible claw’
In the summer of 1964 John Ostrom was prospecting for fossils
in Cretaceous rocks near Bridger, Montana, and collected the
fragmentary remains of a new and unusual predatory dinosaur.
Further collecting yielded more complete remains, and by 1969
Ostrom was able to describe the new dinosaur in sufﬁcient detail
and to christen it Deinonychus (‘terrible claw’) in recognition of
a wickedly hooked, gaff-like claw on its hind foot.
Deinonychus (Figure 16) was a medium-sized (2–3 metres in
length), predatory dinosaur belonging to a group known as the
theropods. Ostrom noted a number of unexpected anatomical
features; these prepared the intellectual ground for a revolution
that would shatter the then rather ﬁrmly held view of dinosaurs
as archaic and outmoded creatures that plodded their way to
extinction at the close of the Mesozoic world.
However, Ostrom was far more interested in understanding the
biology of this puzzling animal than in simply listing its skeletal
features. This approach is far removed from the pejorative epithet
‘stamp-collecting’ that palaeontology had attracted, and echoes the
method of Louis Dollo in his earlier attempts to understand the
biology of the ﬁrst complete Iguanodon skeletons (Chapter 1). As an

i) The animal was clearly bipedal (it ran on its hind legs
alone) and its legs were long and slender.
ii) Its feet were unusual in that of the three large toes on
each, only two were designed to be walked upon, the
inner toe was held clear of the ground and ‘cocked’ as if
ready for action (a bit like a huge version of the sharp
retractile claws in a cat’s paw).
iii) The front part of the animal was counterbalanced at the
hip by a long tail; however, this tail was not of the deep,
muscular variety normally expected in these types of
animal, but was ﬂexible and muscled near the hips,

Dinosaurs

becoming very narrow (almost pole-like) and stiffened by
bundles of thin, bony rods along the rest of its length.
iv) The chest was short and compact, and supported very
long arms that ended in sharply clawed (raptorial) threeﬁngered hands that swivelled on wrists that allowed the
hands to be swung in a raking arc (like those of a praying
mantis).
v) The neck was slender and curved (rather like that of a
goose), but supported a very large head, which was
equipped with long jaws, lined with sharp, curved, and
saw-edged teeth; very large eye sockets that seem to
point forward; and a much larger than expected
braincase.

approach, it has more in common with modern forensic pathology,
driven as it is by a need to assemble broad ranges of facts from a
number of different scientiﬁc areas in order to arrive at rigorous
interpretation, or hypothesis, on the basis of the available evidence;
this is one of several driving forces behind today’s palaeobiology.

Deducing the biology and natural history
of Deinonychus
Looking at Deinonychus using this type of ‘forensic’ perspective,
what do these features tell us about the animal and its way of life?

The need for an elaborate brain is further emphasized by
considering the light stature and slender proportions of its legs,
which are similar to those of modern, fast-moving animals and
suggest that Deinonychus was a sprinter. The narrowness of each
foot ( just two walking toes, rather than the more stable, and more
usual, ‘tripod’ effect of three) suggests that its sense of balance must
have been particularly well developed; this is further supported by
the fact that this animal was bipedal, and clearly able to walk while
balanced on two feet alone (a feat that, as toddlers prove daily,
needs to be learned and perfected through feedback between the
brain and musculoskeletal system).
Linked to this issue of balance and coordination, the ‘terrible claw’
on each foot was clearly an offensive weapon, evidence of the
animal’s predatory lifestyle. But how, exactly, would it have been
used? Two possibilities spring to mind: either it was capable of
47

Dinosaur renaissance

The jaws and teeth (sharp, with curved and serrated edges) conﬁrm
that this was a predator capable of slicing up and swallowing its
prey. The eyes were large, pointed forward, and would have offered
a degree of stereoscopic vision, which would be ideal for judging
distance accurately: very useful for catching fast-moving prey, as
well as for monitoring athletic movements in three-dimensional
space. This serves, in part at least, to explain the relatively large
brain (implied from its large braincase): the optic lobes would need
to be large to process lots of complex visual information so that the
animal could respond quickly, and the motor areas of the brain
would need to be large and elaborate to process the higher-brain
commands and then coordinate the rapid muscular responses of
the body.

Dinosaurs

slashing at its prey with one foot at a time, as some large
ground-dwelling birds such as ostriches and cassowaries do today
(this implies that it could have balanced on one foot from time to
time); alternatively, it may have attacked its prey using a two-footed
kick, by jumping on its prey or by grasping its prey in its arms and
giving a murderous double-kick – this latter style of ﬁghting is
employed by kangaroos when ﬁghting rivals. We are unlikely to
be able to decide which of these speculations might be nearest
the truth.
The long arms and sharply clawed hands would be effective
grapples for holding and ripping its prey in either of these
prey-capture scenarios and the curious raking motion made
possible by the wrist joints enhances their raptorial abilities
considerably. In addition, the long, whip-like tail may well have
served as a cantilever – the equivalent of a tightrope walker’s pole to
aid balance when slashing with one foot – or it could have served
as a dynamic stabilizer, which would prove useful when chasing
fast-moving prey that were capable of changing direction very
quickly or when leaping on prey.
While this is not an exhaustive analysis of Deinonychus as a
living creature, it does provide an outline of some of the reasoning
that led Ostrom to conclude that Deinonychus was an athletic,
surprisingly well-coordinated, and probably intelligent predatory
dinosaur. Why should the discovery of this creature be regarded as
so important to the ﬁeld of dinosaur palaeobiology? To answer that
question, it is necessary to take a broader view of the dinosaurs as
a whole.

The traditional view of dinosaurs
Throughout the earlier part of the 20th century, it was widely (and
perfectly reasonably) assumed that dinosaurs were a group of
extinct reptiles. Admittedly, some were dramatically large or rather
outlandish-looking compared to modern reptiles, but they were
48

crucially still reptiles. Richard Owen (and Georges Cuvier before
him) had conﬁrmed that dinosaurs were anatomically most similar
to living reptiles, creatures such as lizards and crocodiles. On
this basis it was inferred, logically, that most of their biological
attributes would have been similar, if not identical, to those of these
living reptiles: they laid shelled eggs, had scaly skins, and had a
‘cold-blooded’, or ectothermic, physiology.

There were many depictions of dinosaurs in popular books, and
scientiﬁc ones, wallowing in swamps, or squatting as if barely able
to support their gargantuan bodies. Some particularly memorable
examples, such as O. C. Marsh’s Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus,
reinforced these conceptions. Both had enormous bodies and
the tiniest of brains (even Marsh remarked in disbelief at the
‘walnut-sized’ brain cavity of his Stegosaurus). So lacking in
brainpower was Stegosaurus that it was deemed necessary to
invent a ‘second brain’, in its hip region, to act as a sort of back-up
or relay station for information from distant parts of its body, thus
conﬁrming the ‘stupid’ and ‘lowly’ status of dinosaurs beyond
reasonable doubt.
While the weight of comparative evidence undoubtedly sustained
this particular perception of the dinosaur, it ignored, or simply
49

Dinosaur renaissance

To help demonstrate that this view was correct, Roy Chapman
Andrews had discovered that Mongolian dinosaurs laid shelled
eggs, and Louis Dollo (among others) had identiﬁed impressions of
their scaly skins; so their overall physiology would be expected to
resemble that of living reptiles. This combination of attributes
created an entirely unexceptional view of dinosaurs: they were
large, scaly, but crucially slow-witted and sluggish creatures.
Their habits were assumed to be similar to those of lizards, snakes,
and crocodiles, which most biologists had only ever seen in zoos.
The only puzzle was that dinosaurs were mostly built on a far
grander scale compared to even the very biggest of known
crocodiles.

glossed over, contradictory observations: many dinosaurs, such as
little Compsognathus (Figure 14), were known to be lightly built
and designed for rapid movement. By implication they should have
had rather un-reptile-like levels of activity.

Dinosaurs

Armed with this battery of prevailing opinion and Ostrom’s
observations and interpretations based on Deinonychus, it is easier
to appreciate how this creature must have been challenging his
mind. Deinonychus was a relatively large-brained, fast-moving
predator capable of sprinting on its hind legs and attacking its prey
– common sense said that this was no ordinary reptile.
One of Ostrom’s students, Robert Bakker, took up this theme by
aggressively challenging the view that dinosaurs were dull, stupid
creatures. Bakker argued that there was compelling evidence that
dinosaurs were more similar to today’s mammals and birds. It
should not be forgotten that this argument echoes the incredibly
far-sighted comments made by Richard Owen in 1842, when he
ﬁrst conceived the idea of the dinosaur. Mammals and birds are
regarded as ‘special’ because they can maintain high activity levels
that are attributed to their ‘warm-blooded’, or endothermic,
physiology. Living endotherms maintain a high and constant body
temperature, have highly efﬁcient lungs to maintain sustained
aerobic activity levels, are capable of being highly active whatever
the ambient temperature, and are able to maintain large and
sophisticated brains; all these attributes distinguish birds and
mammals from the other vertebrates on Earth.
The range of evidence Bakker used is interesting when considered
from our now slightly more ‘tuned’ palaeobiological perspective.
Using the anatomical observations made by Ostrom, he argued, in
agreement with Owen before him, that:
i)

Dinosaurs had legs arranged pillar-like beneath the body (as do
mammals and birds), rather than legs that sprawl out sideways
from the body, as seen in lizards and crocodiles.
50

ii)

Some dinosaurs had complex, bird-like lungs, which would have
permitted them to breathe more efﬁciently – as would be necessary
for a highly energetic creature.
iii) Dinosaurs could, based on the proportions of their limbs, run at
speed (unlike lizards and crocodiles).

However, borrowing from the ﬁelds of histology, pathology, and
microscopy, Bakker reported that thin sections of dinosaur bone,
when viewed under a microscope, showed evidence of a complex
structure and rich blood supply that would have allowed a rapid
turnover of vital minerals between bone and blood plasma – exactly
paralleling that seen in modern mammals.

Using these admittedly simple proxies, he suggested that dinosaurs
(or at least the predators) must have had metabolic requirements
more similar to mammals; for the communities to stay in some
degree of balance, there needed to be sufﬁcient prey items to
support the appetites of the predators.
Within the ﬁelds of geology and the ‘new’ palaeobiology, he also
looked for macroevolutionary evidence (large-scale patterns of
51

Dinosaur renaissance

Turning to the ﬁeld of ecology, Bakker analysed the relative
abundances of predators and their supposed prey among samples
of fossils representing time-averaged communities from the fossil
record and the present day. By comparing modern communities
of endotherms (cats) and ectotherms (predatory lizards), he
estimated that endotherms consume, on average, ten times the
volume of prey during the same time interval. When he surveyed
ancient (Permian) communities, by counting fossils of this age in
museum collections, he observed rather similar numbers of
potential predators and prey. When he examined some dinosaur
communities from the Cretaceous period, he noticed that there was
a considerably larger number of potential prey compared to the
number of predators. He came to a similar conclusion after
studying Tertiary mammal communities.

Dinosaurs

change in fossil abundance) taken from the fossil record. Bakker
examined the times of origin and extinction of the dinosaurs for
evidence that might have had a bearing on their putative physiology.
The time of origin of the dinosaurs, during the Late Triassic
(225 Ma), coincided with the time of the evolution of some of
the most mammal-like creatures, with the ﬁrst true mammals
appearing about 200 Ma. Bakker suggested that dinosaurs
evolved into a successful group simply because they developed an
endothermic metabolism slightly earlier than mammals. If not, or
so he argued, dinosaurs would never have been able to compete
with the ﬁrst truly endothermic mammals. In further support of
this idea, he noted that true early mammals were small, probably
nocturnal insectivores and scavengers during the entirety of the
Mesozoic, when the dinosaurs ruled on land, and only diversiﬁed
into the bewildering variety that we know today once the dinosaurs
became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. On that basis, so
Bakker argued, dinosaurs simply had to be endotherms, otherwise
the supposedly ‘superior’ endothermic mammals would have
conquered the land and replaced the dinosaurs in the Early
Jurassic. Moreover, when he considered the time of extinction of the
dinosaurs at the close of the Cretaceous (65 Ma), Bakker believed
that there was evidence that the world had been subjected to a
temporary period of low global temperatures. Since dinosaurs were,
in his opinion, large, endothermic, and ‘naked’ (that is, they were
scale-covered and had neither hair nor feathers to keep their bodies
warm), they were unable to survive a period of rapid climatic
cooling and therefore died out. This left the mammals and birds to
survive to the present day. Dinosaurs were too big to shelter in
burrows, as do the modern reptiles that evidently survived the
Cretaceous catastrophe.
Combining all these lines of argument, Bakker was able to propose
that far from being slow and dull, dinosaurs were intelligent, highly
active creatures that had stolen the world from the traditionally
superior mammals for the remaining 160 million years of the
Mesozoic. Rather than being ousted from the world by the
52

evolutionary rise of superior mammals, they had only given up their
dominance because of some freakish climatic event 65 million
years ago.
It should now be obvious that the palaeobiological agenda for
research is rather more intellectually broad-based. The ‘expert’ can
no longer rely upon specialist knowledge in his or her own narrow
area of expertise. However, this part of the story does not end here.
John Ostrom had another important part to play in this saga.

Ostrom and Archaeopteryx: the earliest bird

The more Ostrom studied Archaeopteryx, the more convinced he
became of the extent of the anatomical similarity between this
creature and his much larger predatory dinosaur Deinonychus
(Figure 16). This led him to reassess the monumental and then
authoritative work on bird origins that had been written by
ornithologist and anatomist Gerhard Heilmann in 1926. The sheer
number of anatomical similarities between carnivorous theropod
dinosaurs and early birds drove Ostrom to question Heilmann’s
conclusion in that work that the similarities could only have been due
to evolutionary convergence.
53

Dinosaur renaissance

Having described Deinonychus, Ostrom continued to investigate
the biological properties of dinosaurs. In the early 1970s a triﬂing
discovery in a museum in Germany was to bring him right back to
the centre of some heated discussions. While examining collections
of ﬂying reptiles, Ostrom noticed one specimen, collected from a
quarry in Bavaria, that did not belong to a pterosaur, or ﬂying
reptile, as its label suggested. It was a section of a leg including the
thigh, knee-joint, and shin. Its detailed anatomical shape reminded
Ostrom of that of Deinonychus. On closer inspection, he could also
make out the faintest impressions of feathers! This was clearly an
unrecognized specimen of the fabled early bird Archaeopteryx
(Figure 13). Excited by his new discovery, and naturally puzzled by
its apparent similarity to Deinonychus, Ostrom began carefully
restudying all the known Archaeopteryx specimens.

Dinosaurs

17. Comparison of the clavicles of (a) early theropod dinosaurs,
(b) Archaeopteryx (clavicles are fused together), and (c) modern birds

Armed with more recent discoveries of dinosaurs around the world,
Ostrom was able to show that a number of dinosaurs did actually
possess small clavicles, removing at a stroke Heilmann’s big
stumbling block to a dinosaurian ancestry for birds. Encouraged
by this discovery and his own detailed observations on theropods
and Archaeopteryx, Ostrom launched a comprehensive assault on
Heilmann’s theory in a series of articles in the early 1970s. This led
to the gradual acceptance of a theropod dinosaur ancestry of birds
by the great majority of palaeontologists, and would no doubt have
pleased the far-sighted Huxley and deeply irritated Owen.
The close anatomical, and therefore biological, similarity between
theropods and the earliest birds added fuel to the controversy
concerning the metabolic status of dinosaurs. Birds are highly
active, endothermic creatures; perhaps the theropod dinosaurs
might also have possessed an elevated metabolism. The once clear
dividing line between feathered birds, with their distinctive
anatomy and biology which merited them being separated off from
all other vertebrates as a discrete class, the Aves, and other more
typical members of the class Reptilia (of which the dinosaurs were
just one extinct group) became worryingly blurred. The extent of
this blurred line has become even more pronounced in recent years
(as we shall see in Chapter 6).

54

Chapter 3
New light on Iguanodon

The resurgence in palaeobiology in the 1960s, and the new insights
into dinosaurs prompted by John Ostrom’s important work,
provided a spur to reinvestigate some of the earliest discoveries.
Louis Dollo’s description of the incredible discoveries of Iguanodon
at Bernissart created the image of a giant (5 metres tall, 11 metres
long) kangaroo-like creature. It had:
powerful back legs and a massive tail that helped it to balance . . . [and]
was a plant eater . . . it grasped bunches of leaves with its long tongue,
then pulled them into its mouth to be clipped off with the beak.

The picture of Iguanodon was of an animal that was the dinosaur
equivalent of a ‘tree browser’, represented in the recent past by the
giant South American ground sloths and today by giraffes. Dollo
himself referred to Iguanodon as a ‘girafe reptilienne’. Rather
surprisingly, nearly every aspect of this vision of Iguanodon is
incorrect or seriously misleading.

Bernissart: a ravine where Iguanodon perished?
Some of the earliest work at Bernissart focused on the extraordinary
circumstances of the original discovery. The dinosaurs had been
unearthed in a coal mine at depths of between 356 and 322 metres
55

Dinosaurs

below the surface (Figure 18). This was unexpected, as the coal
seams being excavated were known to be Palaeozoic in age and
dinosaurs are of course unknown in rocks of such antiquity.
However, the Iguanodon skeletons were not found in the coal seams
themselves, but in a pocket of shale of Cretaceous age that cut
across the more ancient coal-bearing rocks. Mining geologists had a
commercial interest in discovering the extent of these clays, and the
degree to which they might affect coal extraction, so they began
mapping the area.
Cross sections of the mine, created during these geological
investigations, suggested that the horizontal layers of Palaeozoic
rocks (with their valuable coal seams) were occasionally cut through
very steeply by beds of Mesozoic shale (ﬁnely laminated clays). The
cross sections gave the ﬁrst impression of steep-sided ravines cut
into the ancient rocks, and formed the basis for a graphic and rather
appealing notion that the Bernissart dinosaurs represented a herd
that had tumbled to their deaths (Figure 18). Dollo, himself no
geologist, was more inclined to the idea that these dinosaurs had
lived, and died, in a narrow gorge. However, the more dramatic
story had the greater impact, and was further embellished by
suggestions that they had been stampeded into the ravine by huge
predatory dinosaurs (megalosaurs), or by some freak event such as a
forest ﬁre. This was not entirely wishful thinking: extremely rare
fragments of a large predatory dinosaur were discovered within
the Iguanodon-bearing beds; and charcoal-like lumps of coal
were recovered from some of the rubble-like deposits found in the
region between the coal-bearing rocks and the dinosaur-bearing
shaly beds.
The discoveries at Bernissart presented a huge logistic challenge
in the 1870s and early 1880s. Complete skeletons of dinosaurs
measuring up to 11 metres in length had been discovered at
the bottom of a deep mine; they were the focus of worldwide
interest at the time, but how were they to be excavated and
studied?
56

18. Geological section of the Bernissart mine

Dinosaurs

A cooperative venture was arranged between the Belgian
government, funding the scientists and technicians of the Royal
Natural History Museum in Brussels, and the miners and engineers
at the colliery in Bernissart. Each skeleton was carefully exposed
and its position in the mine recorded systematically on plan
diagrams. Every skeleton was divided into manageable blocks
approximately 1 metre square. Each block, protected by a jacket of
plaster of Paris, was carefully numbered and recorded on plan
drawings (Figure 19) before being lifted and transported to Brussels.
Back in Brussels, the blocks were reassembled from the records,
rather like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. The plaster was painstakingly
removed to reveal the bones of each skeleton. At this point an artist,
Gustave Lavalette, specially commissioned for the project, drew the
skeleton in its death pose before any further preparation or
extraction was undertaken (Figure 20). Some skeletons were
completely extracted from the shale and mounted to create a

19. Plan diagram of an excavated Iguanodon skeleton from Bernissart

magniﬁcent display that can be seen to this day at the (renamed)
Royal Institute of Natural Sciences, in Parc Léopold, Brussels. Other
skeletons were cleared of the shale matrix on one side only and
arranged in their burial pose on wooden scaffolding supporting vast
banks of plaster. This display mimics their entombed positions
when they were ﬁrst discovered in the mine at Bernissart.
The original plans of each excavation, and some crude geological
sections and sketches of the discoveries, are preserved in the
archives of the Royal Institute in Brussels. This information has
been ‘mined’, this time for clues concerning the geological nature of
the dinosaur burial site.

New light on Iguanodon

The geology of the coal-mining area of the Mons Basin, in which
lies the village of Bernissart, had been the subject of study before
dinosaurs were ever discovered. A major review in 1870 pointed out

Dinosaurs

that the coal-bearing strata of the Mons Basin were pock-marked by
‘cran’ (naturally formed subterranean pits). Each ‘cran’ was of
limited extent and ﬁlled with shales. It was concluded that
these had formed by the dissolution of Palaeozoic rocks deep
underground. The roofs of such caverns collapse periodically under
the sheer weight of the overlying rocks, so the spaces become ﬁlled
with whatever lies above: in this case soft clays or shales. The
collapse of such sediments had been recorded locally in the Mons
area as rather alarming, earthquake-like shocks. By amazing
coincidence, a minor ‘earthquake’ of this type took place while the
dinosaurs were being excavated in August 1878 at Bernissart. Minor
collapses in the galleries were noted, as well as ﬂooding, but the
miners and scientists were soon able to resume their work once
the ﬂood water had been pumped out.
Despite all the local geological knowledge, it is very curious that the
scientists from the Museum in Brussels incorrectly interpreted the
geological nature of the ‘cran’ at Bernissart. The mining engineers
produced crude geological sections from the tunnels that yielded
the dinosaurs. These showed that immediately beyond the
coal-bearing seams there was a section of 10–11 metres of breccia
(broken beds containing irregular blocks of limestone and coal
mixed with silt and clay, the ‘collapsed coal-bearing rocks’ of Figure
18) before entering steeply dipping, but more regularly stratiﬁed,
shales that yielded the fossils. Toward the middle of the ‘cran’ the
clay beds were horizontally bedded, and as the tunnel approached
the opposite side of the ‘cran’ the beds once again became steeply
tilted in the opposite direction before passing again into a
brecciated region and ﬁnally re-entering the coal-bearing deposits.
The symmetry of the geology across the ‘cran’ is exactly what would
be expected if overlying sediments had slumped into a large cavity.
The sediments in which the dinosaurs are embedded also directly
contradict the ravine or river-valley interpretations. Finely stratiﬁed
shales containing the fossils are normally deposited in low-energy,
relatively shallow-water environments, probably equivalent to a
60

large lake or lagoon. There is simply no evidence for catastrophic
deaths caused by herds of animals plunging into a ravine. In fact,
the dinosaur skeletons were found in separate layers of sediment
(along with ﬁsh, crocodiles, turtles, thousands of leaf impressions,
and even rare insect fragments), proving that they deﬁnitely did not
all die at the same time and therefore could never have been part of
a single herd of animals.
Study of the orientation of the fossil skeletons within the mine
suggests that dinosaur carcasses were washed into the burial
area on separate occasions and from different directions. It was
as if the direction of ﬂow of the river that carried their carcasses
had changed from time to time, exactly as happens in large,
slow-moving river systems today.

The image of Iguanodon as a gigantic kangaroo-style creature has
become iconic because of the generous distribution of full-sized
skeletal casts to many museums around the world. But does the
evidence for this restoration survive further scrutiny?

A ‘twist’ in the tail
Re-examining the skeletal evidence from ﬁrst principles, the
anatomy of the skeletons from Bernissart reveal some disconcerting
features. One of the most obvious concerns the massive tail of
Iguanodon. The well-known reconstruction shows the animal
(Figure 12) propped, in true kangaroo style, using its tail and hind
61

New light on Iguanodon

So, as early as the 1870s, it was clearly understood that there
were neither ‘ravines’ nor ‘river valleys’ in which the dinosaurs
at Bernissart might have perished. It is fascinating how the
dramatic discovery of dinosaurs at Bernissart seems to have
demanded an equally dramatic explanation for their deaths,
and that such fantasies were uncritically adopted even though
they ﬂew in the face of the scientiﬁc evidence available at
the time.

Dinosaurs

legs tripod-like. To adopt this posture, the tail curves upward to the
hip. In sharp contrast, all the documentary and fossil evidence
points to this animal normally holding its tail essentially straight or
somewhat downwardly curved. This is clearly seen in the specimens
arranged on banks of plaster in the museum, and in the wonderful
pencil sketches made of their skeletons before they were exhibited
(Figure 20). It could of course be argued that this shape was simply
an artefact of preservation, but this explanation is deﬁnitely not
plausible here. The backbone was in effect ‘trussed’ on either side by
a trellis-like arrangement of long bony tendons that held the
backbone quite deliberately straight; these can be seen in Figure 20.
As a result, the heavy, muscled tail served as an enormous cantilever
to balance the weight of the front part of the body at the hips. The
truth is that the upward sweep of the tail seen in Dollo’s
reconstructions would have been physically impossible for these
animals in life. Careful examination of the skeleton revealed that
the tail was deliberately broken in several places to achieve the
upward bend – a case perhaps of Louis Dollo making the skeleton
ﬁt his personal ideas a little over-zealously.
This discovery disturbs the pose of the remainder of the skeleton. If
the tail is straightened so that it can adopt a more ‘natural’ shape,
then the tilt of the body changes dramatically, with the backbone
becoming more horizontal and balanced at the hip. As a result the
chest is lower, bringing the arms and hands closer to the ground
and raising questions about their likely function.

Hands or feet?
The hand of Iguanodon has become part of dinosaurian folklore
for one obvious reason. The conical thumb-spike was originally
identiﬁed as a rhinoceros-like horn on the nose of the Iguanodon
(Figure 9) and was immortalized in the giant concrete models
erected at London’s Crystal Palace (Figure 2, Chapter 1). It was not
until Dollo provided the ﬁrst deﬁnitive reconstruction of Iguanodon
in 1882 that it was proved to everyone’s satisfaction that this bone
62

was indeed a part of the dinosaur’s hand. However, the hand (and
the entire forelimb) of this dinosaur held a few more surprises.

This re-examination led me to dramatically revise earlier ideas and
conclude that the hand is one of the most peculiar seen in the entire
animal kingdom. The thumb was without doubt an impressive,
stiletto-like weapon of defence (Figure 21B); the three central
ﬁngers were clearly adapted to bear weight (rather than for
grasping things as hands usually do); and the ﬁfth ﬁnger was
sufﬁciently long and ﬂexible to act as a truly ﬁnger-like grasping
(prehensile) organ (Figure 21A).
The idea that the hand could act as a foot for walking upon, or at
least supporting some of the body weight, was revolutionary – but
was it true? This prompted further research on the arm and
shoulder for additional evidence that might conﬁrm such a radical
reinterpretation.
63

New light on Iguanodon

The thumb, or ﬁrst ﬁnger, comprises a large, conical, claw-bearing
bone that sticks up at right angles to the rest of the hand and can be
moved very little (Figure 21A). The second, third, and fourth ﬁngers
are very differently arranged: three long bones (metacarpals) form
the palm of the hand and are bound tightly together by strong
ligaments; the ﬁngers are jointed to the ends of these metacarpals
and are short, stubby, and end in ﬂattened and blunt hooves. When
these bones were manipulated, to see what their true range of
movement was likely to be, it was found that the ﬁngers splayed
outwards (away from each other) and certainly could not ﬂex to
form a ﬁst and perform simple grasping functions, as might have
been expected. This distinctive arrangement looks similar to that
seen in the feet of this animal: the three central toes of each foot are
similarly shaped and jointed, splay apart, and end in ﬂattened
hooves. The ﬁfth ﬁnger is different from all the others: it is quite
separate from the previous four and set at a wide angle from the
remainder of the hand; it is also long and has a wide range of
movement at each joint, and was presumably unusually ﬂexible.

Dinosaurs

21A. Iguanodon’s hand, showing a range of uses

First of all, the wrist proved to be interesting. The bones of the wrist
are welded together to form a bony block, instead of being a row of
smooth, rounded bones that could slide past one another in order to
allow that hand to swivel against the forearm. All the individual
wrist bones have been welded together by bony cement, and are
further strengthened around the outside by strands of bony
ligament. These features obviously combined to lock the wrist
ﬁrmly against the hand and forearm bones and resist the forces
acting through them during weight-bearing, as would be necessary
if the hands were truly acting as feet.
64

New light on Iguanodon

21B. The stiletto-like thumb of Iguanodon in action

The remainder of the arm bones are extremely stoutly built, again
primarily for strength during weight support, rather than for
allowing ﬂexibility as is more normal with genuine arms. The
stiffness of the forearm has important consequences for the way in
which the hand would have been placed on the ground – the ﬁngers
would have pointed outward and the palms inward – an unusual
consequence of converting a hand into a foot. The pose of the hand,
in this rather awkward manner, has been conﬁrmed by examination
of the shape of forefoot prints left by this dinosaur.
The upper arm (humerus) is massive, rather pillar-like, and shows
evidence that it anchored huge arm and shoulder muscles. This is
65

22. New reconstruction of Iguanodon

also unusually long, over three-quarters the length of the hind
limb. The true size of the arms is somewhat masked in the original
skeletal reconstructions, because they were folded against the chest
and always seemed shorter than they really are.
Finally, the shoulder bones are large and powerfully built, which
makes perfect sense if the arms are functioning as legs. But the
shoulders show another unexpected feature. In the centre of the
chest of the larger skeletons at Bernissart there is an irregular bone
that grew in the soft tissues across the centre of the chest between
the shoulder joints. This bone is pathological in origin – it formed as
a response to strain within the chest created while the animal was
walking on all fours (and is called an intersternal ossiﬁcation).

Size and sex
The Bernissart discoveries are notable for comprising two
types of Iguanodon. One (Iguanodon bernissartensis – quite
literally ‘the Iguanodon that lived in Bernissart’) is large and
robustly built, and represented by more than 35 skeletons; the other
(Iguanodon atherﬁeldensis, formerly called I. mantelli – literally
‘Mantell’s Iguanodon’) is smaller and more delicately built
(approximately 6 metres in length) and represented by only
two skeletons.

Reassessing the posture of Iguanodon in the light of these
observations, it seems clear that a more natural pose of the
backbone was horizontal, with the body weight distributed
along the backbone and largely balanced at the hips and
supported by the massive and strong hind legs. The ossiﬁed
tendons distributed along the spine, above the chest, hip, and tail,
clearly acted as tensioners to distribute body weight along the
backbone. This pose allowed the front limbs to reach the ground,
and these were used for weight support while these animals were
stationary. Iguanodon probably moved slowly on all fours at least
part of the time (Figure 22).

Dinosaurs

These specimens were regarded as distinct species until they
were reassessed in the 1920s, by Francis Baron Nopcsa, a nobleman
from Transylvania and a palaeontologist. The discovery of two
quite similar types of dinosaur that evidently lived in the same
place, at the same time, prompted him to ask the simple and yet
obvious question: are they males and females of the same species?
Nopcsa attempted to determine sexual differences in a number of
fossil species. In the case of the Iguanodon from Bernissart he
concluded that the smaller and rarer species was the male and the
larger and more numerous species was the female. He observed,
perfectly reasonably, that it is often the case that female reptiles
are larger than males. The biological reason for this is that
females often have to grow large numbers of thick-shelled
eggs; these drain considerable resources from the body before
they are laid.
While this seems quite a reasonable supposition, it is in fact
very difﬁcult to prove scientiﬁcally. Apart from size, which is
surprisingly variable among reptiles as a whole and not nearly
as consistent a feature as Nopcsa would have had us believe,
the features used to distinguish the sexes among living reptiles
are most commonly found in the soft anatomy of the sex organs
themselves, coloration of the skin, or behaviour. This is particularly
unfortunate because only very rarely do fossils ever preserve such
features.
The most valuable evidence would be the discovery of soft
anatomical fossils of the sexual organs of Iguanodon – unfortunately,
this is an extremely unlikely event. And, since we can never know
their true biology and behaviour, we have to be a little cautious
and also realistic. For the present, it is safer to record the differences
(we may have our own suspicions, perhaps), but simply leave it
at that.
A careful study of the more abundant large Iguanodon from
Bernissart revealed that a few were smaller than the average.
68

Measuring the proportions of each of these skeletons revealed
an unexpected growth change. Smaller, presumably immature
specimens had shorter arms than would have been expected.
The comparatively short-armed juveniles may well have
been more adept bipedal runners, but as large adult size and
stature was achieved they may have become progressively
more accustomed to moving around on all fours. This also
ﬁts with the observation of an intersternal ossiﬁcation in
only larger, presumably adult, individuals, which spent more
of their time on all fours compared to smaller, younger
individuals.

Soft tissues

Louis Dollo reported small patches of skin impression on parts
of the skeletons of Iguanodon. A number of the skeletons from
Bernissart are shown in a classic ‘death pose’ with the powerful neck
muscles contracted, during rigor mortis, pulling the neck into a
sharp curve and turning the head upward and backward. That this
pose has been maintained during the time between death and
eventual burial implies that the carcass of the animal had stiffened
and dried out. Under such conditions, its tough, parchment-like
skin would have formed a rigid surface against which the ﬁnegrained muds would have moulded themselves during burial.
Provided that the entombing sediment compacted sufﬁciently to
retain their shape, prior to the inevitable rotting and disappearance
of the dinosaur’s organic tissues, then (as with simple clay moulds)
an impression of the texture of the skin surface would have been
preserved in the sediment.
In the case of Iguanodon the texture of the skin impression that was
69

Soft tissues of fossil creatures are preserved only rarely, and under
exceptional preservational conditions, so palaeontologists have
developed techniques to decipher clues concerning this type of
biology of dinosaurs both directly and indirectly.

23. Iguanodon skin impression

preserved conﬁrmed expectations: it shows a ﬁnely scaled,
ﬂexible covering, very similar in appearance to that seen on
the skin of modern lizards (Figure 23). Clearly, the disappearance of
the original tissue means that any traces of skin pigments have long
vanished.

In particular areas of the body, where large muscles exert forces
on the skeleton, the scarring on bones can be quite distinctive,
even in fossils; this creates a crude map that allows some of the
original musculature to be reconstructed (Figure 24). Such
reconstructions are based on the known muscular arrangements
seen in related living animals, tempered by allowances for the
anatomical differences or novelties seen in the fossil animal that is
being investigated.
Although far from scientiﬁcally ideal, an example of this kind of
approach when trying to understand the musculature of Iguanodon
is to use as a starting point information from two of the nearest
living relatives of dinosaurs: birds and crocodiles. Clearly neither of
71

New light on Iguanodon

In addition to the detailed work that has to be done simply to
describe the bones of the dinosaur’s skeleton, it is also possible
to focus on certain parts of the body, notably the hips, shoulders,
and head, for clues concerning the arrangement of its muscles.
The reason for this is that at the places where muscles and
tendons attach to the surface of bones, tell-tale surface
markings such as elevated ridges of bone or distinctively
pitted muscle scars often form. Skeletal bone is a surprisingly
plastic material. Bones must change shape as the body grows, or
if it has to repair itself following trauma such as a fracture. What
may be less obvious is that even when the body is full grown, its
bones continue to be remodelled in response to ever-changing
patterns of stress and strain. For example, an individual taking
up a course of weight-training will deposit extra skeletal bone in
order to cope with the increased load, especially if this training
regime is continued over time.

Dinosaurs

24. Dinosaur muscle reconstruction

these types of animal represent, at all accurately, the anatomy of
Iguanodon: birds are highly modiﬁed for ﬂight, have no teeth, have
a minuscule tail and unusually modiﬁed hips and leg muscles;
crocodiles, though more conventionally reptilian in shape, are
highly specialized as aquatic predators. Despite these real problems,
they provide a general framework or template – termed the ‘extant
phylogenetic bracket’, or EPB – for reconstruction that can be
supplemented by the ﬁner details of the anatomy of Iguanodon.
The latter includes the general evidence from the overall physical
72

The extant phylogenetic bracket (EPB)
By creating a phylogenetic tree of the nearest relatives of
dinosaurs, it is clear that crocodiles evolved before dinosaurs
appeared and that birds evolved after the earliest dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs are therefore sandwiched evolutionarily between
living crocodiles and living birds.
Anatomical features shared by both living birds and crocodiles should also be present in dinosaurs because they are
quite literally ‘bracketed’ by these living creatures. Sometimes this type of approach can help to deduce biological
features among extinct groups even when there is no clear
specialized creatures such as dinosaurs can be, when compared to living crocodiles and birds, this approach must be
used cautiously.

design (shape and arrangement of the bones) of the skeleton or
skull, and the inﬂuence that these would have on the distribution
and functioning of the muscles. Such reconstructions also need to
account for such factors as the proposed method of locomotion.
For example, the details of the joints between the limb bones,
a consideration of the simple mechanics associated with the
positioning and range of movement of the limbs that was possible
at each limb joint; and, in some cases, the real evidence left behind
by dinosaurs in the form of fossilized tracks that indicate how they
really did move around when alive.
While examining many bony fragments of Iguanodon in the
collections of the Natural History Museum in London, an unusual
specimen caught my eye. It consisted of the battered remains of a

large, partial skull. A few teeth exposed in its upper jaw betrayed
that it was indeed Iguanodon, but beyond that it seemed useless
anatomically. For interest’s sake, I decided to cut the specimen in
half to see if any of its internal anatomy was better preserved. What
was revealed proved to be unexpectedly interesting and exciting.
Although the bones were battered and eroded, it was clear that this
skull had been buried in soft, silty mud that had seeped into all the
spaces. The mud had hardened (lithiﬁed) to a concrete-like
consistency over millions of years. The lithiﬁcation process was so
complete that the mudstone had become impermeable so that
ground-water containing minerals was unable to seep through the
rock and mineralize the skull bones; as a result the bones were
relatively soft and crumbly.

Iguanodon and dietary adaptation
The ﬁrst recognizable fossils of Iguanodon were teeth, whose telltale features showed that it was a herbivorous animal; they were
chisel-shaped to be able to slice and crush plants in the mouth
before they were swallowed.
The need to cut and crush plant food hints at some important
considerations concerning the diets of extinct creatures and some of
the clues that their skeletons may contain.
75

New light on Iguanodon

This peculiar preservation offered an unusual opportunity to
explore skull anatomy. Careful removal of the crumbly skull bones
(rather than the hard mudstone matrix) revealed the shape of the
internal spaces in the skull as a natural mudstone cast (Figure 25).
It included the cavity where the brain had lain, the passages for the
inner ear, and many of the blood vessels and nerve tracts that led to
and from the brain cavity. Given that this particular animal had
died approximately 130 million years ago, it does seem remarkable
that it should prove possible to reconstruct so much of its soft
anatomy.

Iguanodon’s brain
The structure of the brain cavity shows large olfactory
lobes at the front, suggesting that Iguanodon had a welldeveloped sense of smell. Large optic nerves passed through
the braincase in the direction of the big eye sockets, apparently conﬁrming that these animals had good vision. The
large cerebral lobes indicate a well coordinated and active
animal. The inner ear cast shows the looped semicircular
canals that provided the animal’s sense of balance, and a
ﬁnger-like structure that was part of its hearing system.
Beneath the brain cavity hangs a pod-like structure that
housed the pituitary gland, which was responsible for regu-

Dinosaurs

lating its hormone functions. Down either side of the cast
are seen a series of large tubes, which represent the passages through the original braincase wall (chipped away
here of course) for the twelve cranial nerves. Other smaller
pipes and tubes passing through the braincase wall are also
preserved, and these hint at the distribution of a set of blood
vessels that carried blood into the ﬂoor of the brain from the
heart (via the carotid artery) and, of course, drained the
blood away from the brain through the large lateral head
veins that lead back down the neck.

Carnivores have a diet largely comprising meat. From a biochemical
and nutritional perspective, a diet of meat is one of the simplest
and most obvious of options for any creature. Most of the other
creatures in the world are made of roughly similar chemicals as the
carnivores that eat them. Their ﬂesh is therefore a ready and rapidly
assimilated source of food, provided the prey can be caught, sliced
into chunks in the mouth using simple knife-like teeth (or even
swallowed whole), and then quickly digested in the stomach.
76

This whole process has the potential to be relatively quick and
biochemically very efﬁcient in that little is likely to be wasted.
Herbivores face a rather more challenging problem. Plants are
neither particularly nutritious nor readily assimilable when
compared to animal ﬂesh. Plants are primarily built from large
quantities of cellulose, a material that gives them strength and
rigidity. The crucial, and extremely awkward, point about this
unique chemical, so far as animals are concerned, is that it is
completely indigestible: there is simply nothing in the armoury of
chemicals in our guts that can actually dissolve cellulose. As a result,
the cellulose portion of plants passes straight through animals’ guts
as what we call roughage. So, how do herbivores survive on what
appears to be such an unpromising diet?

77

New light on Iguanodon

Plant-eaters have successfully adapted to this diet because they
exhibit a number of characteristic features. They have a good set
of teeth with hard-wearing, durable, complex, and rough grinding
surfaces, and powerful jaws and muscles that can be used to grind
up plant tissues between the teeth to release the nutritionally
usable ‘cell sap’ that is enclosed within plant cell walls. Herbivores
eat large quantities of plant food in order to be able to extract
sufﬁcient nutrients from such comparatively nutrient-poor
material. As a result, herbivores tend to have barrel-shaped bodies
that accommodate large and complicated guts, which are
necessary to store the large volumes of plants that they have to eat
and allow sufﬁcient time for digestion to take place. Herbivores’
large guts house dense populations of microbes that live within
special chambers or pouches in the gut wall; our appendix is a
tiny vestige of such a chamber, and hints at herbivory in our
primate ancestry. This symbiosis allows herbivorous animals to
provide a warm, sheltered environment and constant supplies of
food for the microbes; in their turn, the microbes have the ability
to synthesize cellulase, an enzyme that digests cellulose and
converts it into sugars that can then be absorbed by the host
animal.

Dinosaurs

By most standards, Iguanodon (11 metres long and weighing about
3–4 tonnes) was a large herbivorous animal, and would have
consumed plants in large quantities. Given this background
information, questions about precisely how Iguanodon fed and
assimilated its food can be explored in detail.
One persistent theory concerning its method of feeding was its
suggested use of a long tongue to pull vegetation into the mouth.
This began with Gideon Mantell, who described one of the ﬁrst,
nearly complete lower jaws of Iguanodon. The new fossil included
some tell-tale teeth, so the ownership could not be doubted, and
it had a toothless, spout-shaped front end. Mantell speculated
that the spout shape allowed a long tongue to slide in and out of
the mouth, rather like a giraffe’s does. Mantell could not have
known that the tip of the newly discovered lower jaw was
incomplete and was capped by a predentary bone that ﬁlled in
the ‘spout’.
It is very curious to note that in the 1920s Louis Dollo provided
further support for Mantell’s conjecture. Dollo described a special
opening in the predentary at the tip of the lower jaw; this formed
a tunnel passing straight through the predentary bone that

26. Iguanodon skull
78

allowed a long, thin, muscular tongue to be projected outward
to grasp vegetation and draw it into the mouth. Large bones
(ceratobranchials) that had been found lying between the jaws of
Iguanodon were suggested to act as the attachment for the muscles
that would have operated this type of tongue. Such a structure ﬁtted
neatly with Dollo’s concept of Iguanodon as a high arboreal browser
with a giraffe-like long, grasping tongue.

How Iguanodon chewed its food
Apart from the horny beak that was able to nip off plants at the
front end of the mouth, the sides of the jaws are lined with a
formidable, nearly parallel array of chisel-like teeth that form
irregularly edged blades (Figure 26). Each working tooth slots
neatly against its neighbours in a rank-and-ﬁle arrangement, and
beneath the working teeth are replacement crowns that will slot
into place as the working teeth are worn away, forming what is in
effect a ‘magazine’, or battery, of teeth. This continuous replacement
79

New light on Iguanodon

Careful re-examination of the lower jaws of a number of Iguanodon
skulls from Bernissart failed to reveal Dollo’s predentary tunnel.
The predentary has a sharp upper edge that supported a turtle-like
horny beak. The predentary, and its beak, bit against the similarly
toothless beak-covered premaxillae at the tip of the upper jaw, and
this arrangement allowed these dinosaurs to very effectively crop
the plants upon which they were feeding. The advantage of the
horny beak was that it would have grown continuously (unlike
teeth, which gradually wear away) no matter how tough and
abrasive the plants that were being cropped. The ceratobranchial
bones still require some explanation. In this instance, they would
have been used to anchor the muscles that moved the tongue
around the mouth to reposition the food as it was being chewed
and for pushing the food back into the throat when it was
ready to be swallowed. This is exactly the same role that is
performed by the ceratobranchial bones in the ﬂoor of the
human mouth.

Dinosaurs

pattern is normal for reptiles in general. What is unusual, even by
reptile standards, is that the working and replacement teeth are
held together in an ever-growing magazine as if they were all
contributing to one giant, grindstone-like tooth. Wear between
opposing (upper and lower) magazines maintains a grinding
surface throughout the life of the dinosaur. Rather than having
permanent, hard-wearing grinders (as we do), this could be
described as a disposable model that relies on constant replacement
of individually simpler teeth.
Opposing edges of each cutting blade of teeth have characteristics
that ensure efﬁciency in their cutting action. The inner surfaces
of the lower teeth are coated in a thick layer of extremely hard
enamel, while the remainder of the tooth is made of softer,
bone-like dentine. In contrast, the upper teeth have the reverse
arrangement: the outer edge being coated in thick enamel and
the remainder of the tooth is composed of dentine. When the
jaws are closed, these opposing blades slide past each other: the
hard, enamelled leading edge of the lower jaw magazine meets
the enamelled cutting edge of the upper teeth in a cutting/
shearing action rather like the blades of a pair of scissors (Figure
27). Once the enamelled edges have passed one another, the
enamel edges (unlike scissor blades) then cut against the less
resistant dentine parts of opposing magazines in a tearing
and grinding action, which is ideal for crushing up tough
plant ﬁbres.
The geometry of the grinding surfaces of the upper and lower
‘magazines’ is particularly interesting. The worn surfaces are
oblique, the lower surfaces face outward and upward, while the
upper teeth have worn surfaces that face inward and downward.
This pattern has interesting consequences. In conventional reptiles,
the closure of the lower jaw is brought about by a simple hinge
effect, with the jaws on either side of the mouth closing
simultaneously in what is called an isognathic bite. If this type of
bite is proposed for Iguanodon, then it is immediately obvious that
80

the two sets of teeth on either side of the mouth would simply
become permanently wedged together: the lower jaws jamming
inside the upper ones. This means it is impossible to imagine
how the angled wear surfaces could ever have developed in the
ﬁrst place.

The whole mammalian type of jaw mechanism is dependent upon
very complex jaw muscles, a complex nervous control system, and a
specially constructed set of skull bones to withstand the stresses
associated with this chewing method. By contrast, more
conventional reptiles. of which Iguanodon was one, do not have
an anisognathic jaw arrangement, lack the complex muscular
arrangements that allow the lower jaw to be very precisely
positioned (whether they had the nervous system to control
such movements is largely irrelevant), and their skulls are not
specially reinforced to withstand the lateral forces acting on the
skull bones.
Iguanodon appears to present us with a conundrum: it does not ﬁt
any of the expected models. Is the anatomy wrong, or was this
dinosaur doing something unexpected?
81

New light on Iguanodon

For the angled wear surfaces to have developed, there would
have had to be some ability of the jaws to move sideways as they
closed. This type of movement is achieved in living herbivorous
mammals through the development of an anisognathic jaw closure
mechanism. This relies on the fact that the lower jaws are naturally
narrower than the upper jaws. Special muscles, arranged in a sling
on either side of each jaw bone, are capable to controlling the
position of the jaw very precisely so that the teeth on one side meet
one another and then the lower set is forcibly slid inwards so that
the teeth grind against one another. We humans employ this type
of jaw mechanism, especially when eating tough foods, but it is far
more exaggerated in some classically herbivorous mammals such
as cows, sheep, and goats, where the swing of the jaw is very
obvious.

Dinosaurs

27. Iguanodon teeth and jaws

The lower jaws of Iguanodon are strong, and quite complex, bones.
At the front end each lower jaw is clamped to its neighbour by the
predentary bone. The teeth are arranged essentially parallel to
the length of the jaw, and at the rear there is a tall prong (coronoid
process) of bone which acts as an attachment area for powerful
jaw-closing muscles, and as a lever to improve the force of closure
that can be exerted on the teeth. Behind the coronoid process are a
group of tightly clustered bones that support the hinge-like jaw
joint. The upper jaws, during biting, would have been subjected not
only to vertical forces, created by the upward closure of the lower
jaws and teeth against the uppers, but also to sideways forces
82

generated by the lower teeth wedging themselves between the
upper teeth as the bite force increased.

This remarkable system I named pleurokinesis (‘side movement’).
On the one hand, the system can be seen as a means of avoiding
catastrophic failure of the skull during normal biting. However,
the pleurokinetic mechanism allows a grinding motion between
opposing sets of teeth. This mimics the grinding motion achieved
by herbivorous mammals in a totally different way.
This new chewing system could be linked to another important
observation concerning dinosaurs such as Iguanodon. Its teeth are
recessed (set inwards) from the side of the face. This creates a
depression that might have been covered over by a ﬂeshy cheek –
another most un-reptilian feature. Given that the upper teeth slid
past the lowers to cut up their food, it seems logical to expect that
every time they bit through food in the mouth, at least half of it
would be lost from the sides of the mouth . . . unless, of course,
83

New light on Iguanodon

Of all forces acting on the skull of Iguanodon, the ones that it is
least well-equipped to deal with are sideways forces acting on its
teeth. The long snout (the area in front of the eye sockets) has a
deep inverted ‘U’ shape in cross-section. To resist sideways forces
acting on the teeth, the skull would need to be braced by bony
‘joists’ connecting the upper jaws; this is the arrangement found in
living mammals. Without such bracing, the skull of Iguanodon is
very vulnerable to splitting along its midline simply because the
depth of the cheek bones creates great leverage against the roof of
the snout from forces acting on the teeth. Midline breakage of the
skull was avoided by the provision of hinges that are arranged
diagonally down either side of the skull; these allow the sides of the
skull to ﬂex outward simultaneously as the lower teeth force their
way between the upper ones. Other features deeper within the skull
helped to provide control over the amount of movement that was
possible along this hinge (so that the upper jaws did not simply ﬂop
around loosely).

Dinosaurs

it was caught and recycled in the mouth by some sort of ﬂeshy
cheek. So these dinosaurs appeared to be not only capable of
chewing their food in a surprisingly sophisticated way, but they
also had mammal-like cheeks, and of course to aid the positioning
of the food between the teeth before chews, they would have needed
a big, muscular tongue (and strong ceratobranchials – the
tongue-muscle bones).
Once this new chewing system had been identiﬁed, I was able to
recognize that the pleurokinesis was not a ‘one-off’ invention
associated with Iguanodon. It was actually widespread among
the general group of dinosaurs known as ornithopods, to which
Iguanodon belonged. Tracing the general evolutionary history of
ornithopods across the Mesozoic Era, it became clear that these
types of dinosaur became increasingly diverse and abundant in
time. The ornithopods reached their greatest expression in the
ecosystems of the latest Cretaceous period, at which time they are
often reported as the most numerous of all land-animal fossils
recovered. In some parts of the world, ornithopod dinosaurs,
represented at this time by duck-billed or hadrosaurian dinosaurs,
were exceedingly abundant and diverse: some discoveries in
North America hint at herds of hadrosaurs numbering many tens
of thousands of individuals. Hadrosaurs had the most sophisticated
dental grinders (each of which had as many as 1,000 teeth in them
at any one time) and a well-developed pleurokinetic system.
It seems plausible that these dinosaurs became abundant and
diverse in large measure because they were very efﬁcient at eating
plant food, using the pleurokinetic system. Their evolutionary
success was probably a result of their inheritance of the novel
chewing mechanism ﬁrst identiﬁed in Iguanodon.

84

Chapter 4
Unravelling the genealogy
of dinosaurs

Up to this point, our focus has been largely, if not exclusively,
tuned to exploring aspects of the anatomy, biology, and way of
life of the dinosaur Iguanodon. It must be obvious that Iguanodon
was just one dinosaur that ﬁtted into far larger tableaux of life
in the Mesozoic Era. One of the important tasks that falls to
palaeontologists is to try to discover the genealogy, or evolutionary
history, of the species that they study. To put dinosaurs as a whole
into some sort of perspective, it will be necessary to outline the
techniques used to do this, and our current understanding of
dinosaurian evolutionary history.
One feature of the fossil record is that it offers the tantalizing
possibility of tracing the genealogy of organisms not just over a
few human generations (which is the ambit of modern genealogists)
but over thousands, or millions, of generations, across the
immensity of geological time. The primary means by which such
research is carried out at present is the technique known as
phylogenetic systematics. The premise of this technique is really
quite simple. It accepts that organisms are subject to the general
processes of Darwinian evolution. This does not require anything
more profound than the assumption that organisms that are more
closely related, in a genealogical sense, tend to physically resemble
each other more closely than they do more distantly related
creatures. To try to investigate the degree of relatedness of creatures
85

Dinosaurs

(in this particular case fossil creatures), palaeosystematists are most
interested in identifying as wide a range of anatomical features as
are preserved in the hard parts of their fossils. Unfortunately, a
great deal of really important biological information has simply
rotted and been lost during the process of fossilization of any
skeleton, so, being pragmatic about things, we simply have to make
the most of what is left. Until quite recently, the reconstruction of
phylogenies had relied on hard-part anatomical features of animals
alone; however, technological innovations have now made it
possible to compile data, based on the biochemical and molecular
structure of living organisms, that can add signiﬁcant and new
information to the process.
What the dinosaur systematist has to do is compile lengthy lists of
anatomical characteristics, with the intention of identifying those
that are phylogenetically important, or contain an evolutionary
signal. The task is intended to produce a workable hierarchy of
relationship, based on groupings of ever more closely related
animals.
The analysis also identiﬁes features that are unique to a particular
fossil species; these are important because they establish the special
characteristics that, for example, distinguish Iguanodon from all
other dinosaurs. This probably sounds blindingly obvious but,
in truth, fossil creatures are often based on a small number of
bones or teeth. If other partial remains are discovered in rocks
elsewhere from the original, but of very similar age, it can be quite a
challenge to prove convincingly whether the new remains belong to,
say, Iguanodon, or perhaps a new and previously undiscovered
creature.
Beyond the features that identify Iguanodon as unique, there is also
a need to identify anatomical features that it shares with other
equally distinct, but quite closely related animals. You might say
that these were the equivalent of its anatomical ‘family’. The more
general the characters that ‘family’ groups of dinosaurs share, the
86

The case of Baryonyx
The Early Cretaceous rocks of south-east England have been
intensely investigated by fossil hunters (starting with Gideon
Mantell) and geologists (notably William Smith) for well
over 200 years. Iguanodon bones are very common, as are
the remains of a limited range of other dinosaurs, such as
‘Megalosaurus’, Hylaeosaurus, Polacanthus, Pelorosaurus,
Valdosaurus, and Hypsilophodon. Given the intensity of such
work, it would be thought highly unlikely that anything new
would ever be discovered. However, in 1983 the amateur colpit in Surrey that led to the excavation of an 8-metre-long
predatory dinosaur that was entirely new to science. It was
named Baryonyx walkeri in honour of its discoverer, and
has pride of place on exhibition at the Natural History
Museum in London.
The moral of this story is that nothing should be taken for
granted; the fossil record is likely to be full of surprises.

more this allows them to be grouped into ever larger and more
inclusive categories of dinosaurs that gradually piece together an
overall pattern of relationships for them all.
The real question is: how is this overall pattern of relationships
achieved? For a very long time, the general method that was used
might be described simply as ‘I know best’. It was quite literally the
view of self-styled experts, who had spent much time studying a
particular group of organisms and then summarized the overall
patterns of similarity for their group; their methods for doing this
might vary considerably, but in the end their preferred pattern of
87

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

relationship was little more than just that: their preference,
rather than a rigorous, scientiﬁcally debated solution. While this
method worked reasonably well for restricted groups of organisms,
it proved far more difﬁcult to properly debate the validity of one
interpretation compared with another because the arguments,
when boiled down to their essentials, were circular, relying on one
person’s belief over another’s.

Dinosaurs

This underlying problem was brought into sharp focus when
groups of organisms were very large in number and varied in
many subtle ways. Good examples are groups of insects, or some
of the bewildering varieties of bony ﬁsh. If the general scientiﬁc
community was happy to accept the authority of one scientist for a
period of time then all was apparently ﬁne. However, if experts
could not agree, the end result was frustratingly circular debates.
Over the past four decades, a new methodology has gradually been
adopted that has proved far more valuable scientiﬁcally. It does not
necessarily give the correct answers, but it is at least open to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and real debate. This technique is now widely
known as cladistics (phylogenetic systematics). The name is treated
with a fair degree of trepidation by some, but this is largely because
there have been some very ﬁerce arguments about how cladistics is
done in practice and what the overall signiﬁcance of the results
might be in an evolutionary context. Fortunately, we do not need to
consider much of this debate because the principles are actually
surprisingly simple and clear-cut.
A cladogram is a branching tree diagram that links together
all the species that are being investigated at the time. To create
one, the researcher needs to compile a table (data matrix)
containing a column listing the species under consideration
and against this a compilation of the features (anatomical,
biochemical, etc.) that each species exhibits. Each species is
then ‘scored’ in relation to whether it does (1) or does not (0)
possess each character, or in some instances if the decision is
88

uncertain this can be signiﬁed as a (?). The resulting matrix
of data (these can be very large) is then analysed using a number
of proprietary computer programs, whose role is to assess the
distribution of 1s and 0s and generate a set of statistics that
determines the most parsimonious distribution of the data
that are shared by the various species. The resulting cladogram
forms the starting point for a considerable amount of further
investigation that is aimed at determining and understanding
the degree to which there are common patterns or overall
similarities, and the extent to which the data might be misleading
or erroneous.

The aim of all this work is to help create as accurate a picture as
possible of the evolutionary history of life or, in this particular case,
the evolutionary history of dinosaurs.

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

The cladogram that results from this type of analysis represents
no more than a working hypothesis of the relationships of the
animals that are being investigated. Each of the branches on
the tree mark points at which it is possible to deﬁne a group
of species that are all connected by their sharing a number of
characteristic features. And using this information it is possible
to construct what is, in effect, a sort of genealogy or phylogeny
representing a model of the evolutionary history of the group
as a whole. For example, if the known geological times of
occurrence of each of the species are plotted on to this pattern,
it becomes possible to indicate the overall history of the group,
and also the probable time at which various of the species may
have originated. In this way, the cladogram, rather than simply
representing a convenient spatial arrangement of species, begins
to resemble a real genealogy. Obviously, each such phylogeny
created in this way is only as good as the data available, and
the data and how it is scored can change with the discovery
of new, better, or more complete fossils, and also as new
methods of analysis are developed or older ones are
improved upon.

28. Dinosaur cladogram

An evolutionary history of the dinosaurs: in brief
An interesting example of this type of systematic approach to the
evolution of dinosaurs is represented by the work of Paul Sereno of
the University of Chicago. Sereno has spent considerable time, over
the past two decades, investigating the systematics and general
evolutionary history of dinosaurs. Figure 28 summarizes this work
and permits an all too brief overview.

While all dinosaurs share these crucial features, they can be divided
into two fundamentally different types: the Saurischia (literally,
‘lizard-hipped’) and Ornithischia (‘bird-hipped’). As these names
suggest, the differences between such dinosaurs lie primarily in the
structure of their hip bones, although several other more subtle
anatomical features are important in helping to distinguish these
two major types. The earliest members of both groups of dinosaur
have been identiﬁed in rocks of Carnian age (at least 225 Ma), but it
has not been possible to identify the earliest dinosaur of all or
whether it was strictly a saurischian, ornithischian, or just a
dinosaurian that was not yet either.

Saurischian dinosaurs
Saurischians include two major groups. Sauropodomorpha are
mainly large-bodied creatures with pillar-like legs, extraordinarily
91

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

Dinosauria are traditionally recognized (as Owen so perceptively
saw) as reptiles with an upright leg posture and specially reinforced
connections between the hips and vertebral column to facilitate the
efﬁcient carriage of the body on its pillar-like legs. These changes
conferred upon early dinosaurs some highly valuable assets:
pillar-like legs could support great body weight very effectively
and dinosaurs could become very large creatures; and, pillar-like
legs allow a long stride, meaning that some dinosaurs could move
very quickly. Both attributes were used very effectively by dinosaurs
throughout their reign on Earth.

Dinosaurs

long tails, long necks ending in small heads, and jaws lined with
simple, peg-shaped teeth, indicating a mainly herbivorous diet.
These include such giants as members of the diplodocoid,
brachiosauroid (Figure 31), and titanosaurian groups. Theropoda
are markedly different to their sauropodomorph relatives. They are
almost entirely agile, bipedal, and predominantly meat-eating
dinosaurs (Figures 30, 31). A long, muscular tail counterbalances the
front of the body at the hip, leaving the arms and hands free to be
used to grab their prey; their heads also tend to be rather large, and
their jaws lined with sharp, knife-like teeth. These types of dinosaur
range from small and rather delicate creatures similar to
Compsognathus, which are commonly referred to as coelurosaurs,
through to such enormous creatures such as the legendary
Tyrannosaurus, while other equally large and fearsome-looking
theropods include Giganotosaurus, Allosaurus, Baryonyx, and
Spinosaurus. Although some of these dinosaurs may be well known,
the group as a whole is proving to be extraordinarily diverse, and in
some cases quite bizarre. Newly discovered therizinosaurs, for
example, appear to have been huge, lumbering creatures with long,
scythe-like claws on their hands, enormous bellies, and ridiculously
small heads whose jaws were lined with teeth that are far more
reminiscent of plant-eaters than conventional meat-eaters. Yet
other theropods known as ornithomimians and oviraptorians were
lightly built, rather ostrich-like creatures that were entirely
toothless (and therefore beaked just like living birds). However, the
source of greatest interest among this entire group of dinosaurs is
the subgroup known as dromaeosaurians.
Dromaeosaurians include such renowned creatures as Velociraptor
and Deinonychus, and a host of similar but less famous creatures
that have been discovered recently. Their particular interest lies in
the fact that their skeletal anatomy is closely similar to that of living
birds; indeed, the similarities are so great that they are thought to
be direct bird ancestors. Dramatic new discoveries, at sites in
Liaoning Province, China, that exhibit truly exceptional
preservational conditions, of dromaeosaurian theropods reveal a

body covering made of either keratinous ﬁlaments (like a coarse
form of hair) or in some cases genuinely bird-like feathers, which
emphasizes their similarity to modern birds.

Ornithischian dinosaurs
All ornithischians are thought to have been herbivorous and, rather
like modern-day mammals, they seem to be far more diverse, and
numerous, than their potential predators.
Thyreophorans (Figure 28) are a major group of ornithischians that

are characterized by bearing bony plates in their body wall, clubs or
spikes adorning their tails, and for having an almost exclusively
quadrupedal method of locomotion. These types of dinosaur
include the stegosaurs, named after the iconic Stegosaurus (well
known for its tiny head, the rows of large bony plates on its back,
and its spiky tail (Figure 31)); and the heavily armoured
ankylosaurs including such creatures as Euoplocephalus. The latter
was a huge tank-like animal that was so heavily armour-plated that
even its eyelids were reinforced by bony shutters and its tail was
terminated in a huge, bony club that it presumably used to skittle
potential predators.
Cerapodans (Figure 28) were very different to thyreophorans. These
were typically lightly built, unarmoured bipeds, although a few did
revert to quadrupedal methods of locomotion. Ornithopods were
one major group of cerapodans. Many of these dinosaurs were
medium-sized (2–5 metres long) and quite abundant (probably
ﬁlling the ecological niches occupied by antelopes, deer, sheep, and
goats today). These animals, such as Hypsilophodon, were balanced
at the hip (just like theropods), had slender legs for fast running,
grasping hands, and, most importantly, teeth, jaws, and cheeks
adapted for a diet of plants. Throughout the reign of the dinosaurs,
small to medium-sized ornithopods were quite abundant, but
through the Mesozoic a signiﬁcant number of larger types evolved;
these are known as iguanodontians (because they include animals
such as Iguanodon). Most important of all the iguanodontians were
the extraordinarily numerous duck-billed, or hadrosaurian,
dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous of North America and Asia. Some
(but not all) of these dinosaurs did indeed have rather duck-shaped
snouts, and others had a wide range of quite extravagant, hollowcrested headgear (see Chapter 7); this headgear may well have been
used for social signalling, and more particularly for making loud,
honking sounds. Marginocephalians were the other major
cerapodan group and appeared in Cretaceous times. These included
the extraordinary pachycephalosaurs (‘thick-headed dinosaurs’);
they had bodies that were very similar in general appearance to the
96

ornithopods, but their heads were very odd-looking. The majority
had a high dome of bone on the top, which looked vaguely similar to
the headgear of hadrosaurians, except for the fact that
pachycephalosaur headgear was made of solid bone. It has been
suggested that these creatures were the ‘headbangers’ of the
Cretaceous world – perhaps using head clashing in similar fashion
to that seen among some cloven-hooved animals today.

Dinosaur systematics and ancient biogeography
This type of research can have interesting, if slightly unexpected,
spin-offs. One spin-off that will be considered here links
phylogenetics with the geographic history of the Earth. The Earth
may in fact have exerted a profound inﬂuence on the overall pattern
of life.
97

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

Finally, there were the ceratopians, a group of dinosaurs that
included the fabled Protoceratops referred to in the Introduction,
as well as the well-known Triceratops (‘three-horned face’). All
had a singular narrow beak at the tip of the jaws and tended to
have a ruff-like collar of bone at the back edge of the skull. While
some of these dinosaurs, particularly the early ones, maintained
a bipedal way of life, a considerable number grew greatly in
body size, with an enlarged head, which was adorned with a
huge frill-like collar and large eyebrow and nose horns. Their
great bulk and heavy head led them to adopt a four-footed
stance, and their similarity to modern-day rhinoceros has
not gone unnoticed. Clearly, as this all too brief survey shows,
dinosaurs were many and varied, judging by the discoveries
made over the past 200 years. But even though to date
about 900 genera of dinosaurs are known, this is only a tiny
fraction of the dinosaurs that lived during the 160 million
years of their reign during the Mesozoic Era. Many of these
will, unfortunately, never be known: their fossils were never
preserved. Others will be discovered by intrepid dinosaur hunters
in years to come.

Dinosaurs

The geological timescale of the Earth was pieced together through
painstaking analysis of the relative ages of sequences of rocks
exposed at various places on Earth. One important component
that assisted this process was the evidence of the fossils that they
contained: if rocks from different places contained fossils of exactly
the same type, then it could be assumed with reasonable conﬁdence
that the rocks were of the same relative age.
In broadly similar fashion, evidence of the similarity of fossils from
different parts of the world began to suggest that the continents
might not have been as ﬁxed in their positions as they appear to be
today. For example, it had been noted that rocks and the fossils that
they contained seemed to be remarkably similar on either side of
the southern Atlantic Ocean. A small aquatic reptile Mesosaurus
was known to exist in remarkably similar-looking Permian rocks in
Brazil and in South Africa. As long ago as 1620, Francis Bacon had
pointed out that the coastlines of the Americas and Europe and
Africa seemed remarkably similar, (see Figure 32d) to the extent
that it seemed as if they could have ﬁtted together as a pair of
gigantic jigsaw pieces. On the basis of evidence from fossils, rocks,
and general shape correspondence, Alfred Wegener, a German
meteorologist, suggested in 1912 that at times in the past the
continents of the Earth must have occupied different positions to
the ones they are in today, with, for example, the Americas and
Eur-Africa nestled together in the Permian Period. Because he was
not a trained geologist, Wegener’s views were ignored, or dismissed
as irrelevant and unprovable speculations. For all its self-evident
persuasiveness, Wegener’s theory lacked a mechanism: common
sense dictated that it was impossible to move things the size of
continents across the solid surface of the Earth.
However, common sense proved to be deceptive. In the 1950s
and 1960s, a series of observations accumulated that supported
Wegener’s views. Firstly, very detailed models of all the major
continents showed that they did indeed ﬁt together remarkably
neatly and with a correspondence that could not be accounted for
98

by chance. Secondly, major geological features on separate
continents became continuous when continents were reassembled
jigsaw-like. And ﬁnally, palaeomagnetic evidence demonstrated the
phenomenon of sea-ﬂoor spreading – that the ocean ﬂoors were
moving like huge conveyor belts carrying the continents – and the
historical remnants of magnetism in continental rocks conﬁrmed
that the continents had moved over time. The ‘motor’ that was
driving this motion was in effect the heat at the core and the ﬂuidity
of rocks in the mantle layer inside the Earth. The theory of plate
tectonics that accounts for the movement of continents over the
surface of the Earth over time is now well established and
corroborated.

During subsequent Periods, the Jurassic (Figure 32b) and
Cretaceous (Figure 32c), it is evident that the supercontinent began
to fragment as the immensely powerful tectonic conveyor belts
imperceptibly, but remorselessly, wrenched Pangaea apart. The end
product of this process at the close of the Cretaceous was a world
that, though still different geographically (note particularly the
position of India in Figure 32c), has some very familiar-looking
continents.
The earliest dinosaurs seem to have been able to disperse across
much of Pangaea, judging by their fossils. However, during the
Jurassic and subsequent Cretaceous Periods it was clearly the case
99

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

From a dinosaur evolutionary perspective, the implications of
plate tectonics are extremely interesting. Reconstructions of past
conﬁgurations of the continents, largely based on palaeomagnetics
and detailed stratigraphy, indicate that at the time of their origin all
the continents were lying clustered together in a single gigantic
landmass, known as Pangaea (‘all Earth’) (Figure 32a). Dinosaurs at
this time were quite literally capable of walking all over the Earth,
and in reﬂection of this it appears to be the case that the fossil
remains of rather similar types (theropods and prosauropods) have
been found on nearly all continents.

An inevitable biological consequence of this intrinsic (Earth-bound)
process of continental sundering is that the once cosmopolitan
population of dinosaurs became progressively subdivided and
isolated. The phenomenon of isolation is one of the keystones of
organismal evolution – once isolated, populations of organisms
tend to undergo evolutionary change in response to local changes to
their immediate environment. In this instance, although we are
dealing with comparatively huge (continent-sized) areas, each of
the continental fragments carried its own population of dinosaurs
(and associated fauna and ﬂora); each of which, with the passing
time, had the opportunity to evolve independently in response to
local changes in environment, stimulated by, for example,
progressive changes in latitude, longitude, adjacent oceanic
currents, and prevailing atmospheric conditions.
Logic dictates that it must clearly have been the case that tectonic
events during the Mesozoic affected the scope and overall pattern of
101

Dinosaurs

that the uniﬁed supercontinent became gradually subdivided by
intervening seaways as continent-sized fragments gradually drifted
apart.

Dinosaurs

the evolutionary history of dinosaurs. Indeed, it seems perfectly
reasonable to suppose that the progressive fragmentation of
ancestral populations over time must have done much to accelerate
the diversiﬁcation of the group as a whole. Just as we can
represent the phylogeny of dinosaurs using cladograms, we could
also represent the geographic history of the Earth through
the Mesozoic Era as a series of branching events as
continental areas separated from the ‘ancestral’ Pangaean Earth.
Of course, this general approach is a simpliﬁcation of true
Earth history because, on occasion, continental fragments have
coalesced, welding together previously isolated populations.
But at least as a ﬁrst approximation, this provides a fertile area
for investigating some of the larger-scale events in Earth
history.
If this model of the natural history of dinosaurs were generally true,
we might expect to be able to detect some evidence in its support by
probing the details of the fossil record of dinosaur species, and the
tectonic models of continental distribution through the Mesozoic.
This type of approach has been developed in recent years to probe
for coincident patterns in the evolutionary history of dinosaurs and
whether their evolutionary history is echoed in their geographic
distribution.

Ornithopod evolution
The earliest work in this ﬁeld of research, carried out in 1984,
concerned a group of dinosaurs that are quite closely related to
the familiar Iguanodon. Generally, these types of dinosaur are
known as ornithopods (‘bird feet’ – this comes from a passing,
trivial resemblance in the structure of the feet of these dinosaurs
to those of modern birds). Comparing in some detail the anatomy
of a number of the then known ornithopods, a cladogram was
constructed. To convert this into a genuine phylogeny it was
necessary to chart on to the cladogam the known distribution of this
group through time and their geographic distributions.
102

While the pattern of replacement of iguanodonts by hadrosaurs in
Late Cretaceous times appeared to be reasonably uniform, there
were one or two puzzling anomalies that needed to be investigated.
There were reports, written at the turn of the 20th century, of
iguanodonts from Europe (primarily France and Romania) in
rocks of very latest Cretaceous age. From the analysis above, these
would not have been expected to have survived into Late Cretaceous
times because everywhere else the pattern was one of hadrosaurs
replacing iguanodonts. In the early 1990s, the best-preserved
material came from Transylvania, a region of Romania. However,
the phylogenetic analysis prompted expeditions to reinvestigate
these discoveries. Fresh study proved that this dinosaur was not a
close relative of Iguanodon, but represented an unusually
long-lasting (relict) member of a more primitive group of
ornithopods. An entirely new name was created for this dinosaur:
Zalmoxes. So, one of the outcomes of the preliminary analysis was a
great deal of new information about an old, but apparently not so
well understood, dinosaur.
103

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

Some surprising patterns in the history of these ornithopod
dinosaurs emerged from this analysis. First it seemed to
demonstrate that the forms most closely related to Iguanodon
(that is to say, members of the group known as iguanodonts) and
their closest relatives (members of the hadrosaur family) probably
originated as a result of continental separation during Late Jurassic
times. The ancestral population from which both groups may have
evolved became subdivided by a seaway at this time. Following this
isolation, one population evolved into the hadrosaurs in Asia, while
iguanodonts evolved elsewhere. These two groups appear to have
evolved distinct from one another through the Late Jurassic and
Early Cretaceous period. However, during the latter half of the
Cretaceous, Asia became reconnected to the rest of the northern
hemisphere continents and its hadrosaurs were apparently able to
spread across the northern hemisphere pretty much unhindered
and replaced iguanodonts wherever they came into contact.

Dinosaurs

A report published in the 1950s suggested that a very Iguanodonlike dinosaur lived in Mongolia in Early Cretaceous times. This
tantalizing report also needed to be investigated further to check
whether its anomalous geographic range – in Asia in Early
Cretaceous times – was real or, as in the Romanian example,
another case of mistaken identity. The material, though
fragmentary, was stored in the Russian Palaeontological Museum
in Moscow, and had to be re-examined. What emerged was again
not as expected. This time the earlier reports proved correct, the
genus Iguanodon itself seemed to be present in Mongolia in Early
Cretaceous times, and the pieces recovered were indistinguishable
from the very well known European Iguanodon.
This second discovery did not ﬁt at all comfortably with the
evolutionary and geographic hypothesis that had been created in
the 1984 analysis. Indeed, in more recent years a suite of very
interesting Iguanodon-like ornithopods have emerged in Asia,
as well as North America, in what can best be described as
‘middle’ Cretaceous times. Much of this very recent, and steadily
accumulating, evidence suggests that the original evolutionary and
geographic model had a number of fundamental ﬂaws that
continued investigation and new discoveries were able to expose.

Dinosaurs: a global perspective
In more recent times, this approach has been applied much more
broadly and in a much more ambitious way. Paul Upchurch of
University College London and Craig Hunn at Cambridge hoped to
explore the entire family tree of the Dinosauria for evidence of
similarities in patterns of stratigraphic ranges and cladistic
patterns by looking at large numbers of dinosaurs. These were
compared to the currently established distributions of the
continents at intervals through the entire Mesozoic Era. An
attempt was being made to ﬁnd out whether an overall signal did
emerge that was suggestive of a tectonic inﬂuence on the
evolutionary history of all dinosaurs.
104

105

Unravelling the genealogy of dinosaurs

Despite the inevitable ‘noise’ in the system resulting largely from
the incompleteness of the fossil record of dinosaurs, it was
heartening to note that statistically signiﬁcant coincident patterns
emerged within the Middle Jurassic, the Late Jurassic, and the
Early Cretaceous intervals. This indicates that tectonic events do, as
expected, play some role in determining where and when particular
groups of dinosaurs ﬂourished. What is more, this effect has also
been preserved in the stratigraphic and geographic distributions of
other fossil organisms, so the evolutionary history of great swathes
of organisms was effected by tectonic events and the imprint is still
with us today. In a way, this is not new. I need only point to the
unusual distribution of marsupial mammals (found only in the
Americas and Australasia today), and the fact that distinct areas of
the modern world have their own characteristic fauna and ﬂora.
What this new research suggests is that we may well be able to trace
the historical reasons for these distributions far more accurately
than we had supposed possible.

Chapter 5
Dinosaurs and warm blood

A number of areas of research on dinosaurs have attracted attention
far beyond the realm of those who take a purely academic interest in
these creatures. This common interest appears to arise because
dinosaurs capture the public imagination in a way that few other
subjects do. The following chapters focus on these topics in order
to illustrate the extraordinary variety of approaches and types of
information that are used in our attempts to unravel the mystery of
dinosaurs and their biology.

Dinosaurs: hot-, cold-, or luke-warm-blooded?
As we have seen in Chapter 1, Richard Owen, at the time of his
invention of the word ‘dinosaur’, speculated about the physiology
of dinosaurs. Extracting meaning from the rather long-winded ﬁnal
sentence of his scientiﬁc report:
The Dinosaurs . . . may be concluded to have . . . [a] superior
adaptation to terrestrial life . . . approaching that which now
characterizes the warm-blooded Vertebrata. [i.e. living mammals
and birds]
(Owen 1842: 204)

Although the ‘mammaloid’ reconstructions of dinosaurs that he
created for the Crystal Palace Park clearly echo his sentiments, the
106

biological implications he was hinting at were never grasped by
other workers at the time. In a sense, Owen’s visionary approach
was tempered by rational Aristotelian logic: dinosaurs were
structurally reptilian, it therefore followed that they had scaly
skins, laid shelled eggs, and, like all other known reptiles, were
‘cold-blooded’ (ectothermic).
In a similar vein to Owen, Thomas Huxley proposed, almost
50 years later, that birds and dinosaurs should be considered close
relatives because of the anatomical similarities that could be
demonstrated between living birds, the earliest known fossil bird
Archaeopteryx, and the newly discovered small theropod
Compsognathus. He concluded that:

intermediate between Dromaeus [an emu] and Compsognathus [a
dinosaur] . . . and the hypothesis that the . . . class Aves has its root
in the Dinosaurian reptiles; . . .
(Huxley 1868: 365)

If Huxley was correct, it should have been possible to ask:
were dinosaurs then conventionally reptilian (physiologically)
or were they closer to the ‘warm-blooded’ (endothermic) birds?
There appeared to be no obvious way of answering such
questions.
Despite such intellectual ‘nudges’, it was close to a century after
Huxley’s paper that palaeontologists began to search with greater
determination for data that might have a bearing on this central
question. The spur to renewed interest in the topic ﬁnds an echo in
the adoption of the broader and more integrated agenda for the
interpretation of the fossil record: the rise of palaeobiology, as
outlined in Chapter 2. We saw there how some wide-ranging
observations were strung together by Robert Bakker into a case for
endothermy in dinosaurs. Let’s now consider these and other
arguments in greater detail.
107

Dinosaurs and warm blood

. . . it is by no means difﬁcult to imagine a creature completely

New approaches: dinosaurs as climatic proxies?

Dinosaurs

Attempts were being made to investigate the degree to which fossils
could be used to reconstruct climates in the ancient world. It is
widely recognized that endotherms (basically mammals and birds)
are not particularly good indicators of climate because they are
found everywhere, from equatorial to polar regions. Their
endothermic physiology (and clever use of body insulation) allows
them to operate more or less independently of prevailing climatic
conditions. By contrast, ectotherms, such as lizards, snakes, and
crocodiles, are reliant on ambient climatic conditions, and as a
result they tend to be found mainly in warmer climatic zones.
Using this approach to examine the geographic distribution of
obvious ectotherms and endotherms in the fossil record proved
useful, but then threw up several interesting questions. For
example, what about the immediate evolutionary ancestors of
endothermic mammals in Permian and Triassic times? Were they
also able to control their internal body temperatures? If they did,
how would it have affected their geographic distribution? And more
pointedly in this context, dinosaurs seemed to have a wide
geographic spread, so did this mean that they were capable of
controlling their body temperature rather like endotherms?

Patterns in the fossil record
The foundation of Bakker’s approach to endothermy in dinosaurs
was the pattern in the succession of animal types in the early
Mesozoic. During the time leading up to the end of the Triassic
Period synapsid reptiles were by far the most abundant and diverse
animals on land.
Right at the close of the Triassic and the beginning of the Jurassic
Period (205 Ma) the very ﬁrst true mammals appeared on Earth
and were represented by small, shrew-like creatures. In complete
contrast, the latter part of the Triassic Period also marks the
108

appearance of the ﬁrst dinosaurs (225 Ma), and across the
Triassic/Jurassic divide the dinosaurs become widespread, very
diverse, and clearly dominant members of the land fauna. This
ecological balance – rare, small, very probably nocturnal mammals
and abundant, large, and increasingly diverse dinosaurs – was then
maintained for the next 160 million years, until the close of the
Cretaceous Period (65 Ma).

These, admittedly very general, observations permit us to have
expectations that can be superimposed on the fossil record. All
things being equal, we would predict that the ﬁrst appearance
of true mammals at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, in a world
otherwise dominated by reptiles, would spark the former’s rapid
evolutionary rise and diversiﬁcation at the expense of the latter.
So the fossil record of mammals would be expected to show a rapid
rise in abundance and diversity in Early Jurassic times, until they
completely dominated the ecosystems of the Mesozoic Era.
However, the fossil record reveals exactly the opposite pattern: the
(reptilian) dinosaurs rose to dominance in the Late Triassic
(220 Ma) and the mammals only began to increase in size and
109

Dinosaurs and warm blood

As animals living in the present day, we are comfortable with the
notion that mammals are, along with birds, the most conspicuous
and diverse of land-living vertebrates. Mammals are self-evidently
fast-moving, intelligent, generally highly adaptable creatures, and
much of this present-day ‘success’ we attribute to their physiological
status: their high basal metabolic rate, which permits the
maintenance of a high and constant body temperature, complex
body chemistry, comparatively large brains, and consequently high
activity levels, and their status as endotherms. In contrast, we
generally observe that reptiles are considerably less diverse and
quite sharply climatically restricted; this is largely explained by the
fact that they have a much lower metabolic rate, rely on external
sources of heat to keep the body warm and therefore chemically
active, and have much lower and more intermittent levels of
activity: the ectothermic condition.

diversity after the dinosaurs had become extinct at the end of the
Cretaceous period (65 Ma).
Bakker’s explanation for this counterintuitive set of events was that
dinosaurs could have succeeded, evolutionarily, in the face of true
mammals only if they too had endotherm-like high basal metabolic
rates and could be as active and resourceful as contemporary
mammals. Dinosaurs quite simply had to be active endotherms – it
was to Bakker a self-evident truth. While the pattern revealed by the
fossil record was indeed clear, the scientiﬁc proof necessary to
support his ‘truth’ needed to be assembled and tested.

Dinosaurs

Legs, heads, hearts, and lungs
Dinosaurs place their feet vertically beneath the body on straight,
pillar-like legs. The only living creatures that also adopt this
posture are birds and mammals; all the rest ‘sprawl’ with their
legs directed sideways from the body. Many dinosaurs were also
slender-limbed and apparently built for moving quickly; this
line of argument reﬂects the fact that Nature does not tend to do
things unnecessarily. If an animal is built as if it could run fast, it
probably did so; it might therefore seem reasonable to expect such a
creature to have an energetic ‘motor’, or endothermic physiology,
to allow it to move quickly. We do, however, need to be careful,
because it is also the case that ectotherms can move very quickly
indeed – crocodiles and Komodo dragons can outrun and catch
unwary humans! The crucial thing is that crocodiles and Komodo
dragons cannot sustain fast running – their muscles build up a large
oxygen debt very quickly and the animals then have to rest so their
muscles can recover. Endotherms, by contrast, can move quickly for
much longer periods of time because their high-pressure blood
system and efﬁcient lungs replenish the oxygen in their muscles
very quickly.
A further reﬁnement of this argument is the suggestion that the
ability to walk bipedally is linked exclusively to endothermy; many
110

mammals, all birds, and many dinosaurs are bipedal. This
argument relates not only to posture, but also to how that posture is
maintained. A quadruped has the advantage of considerable
stability when it walks. A biped is inherently unstable, and to walk
successfully a sophisticated system of sensors monitoring balance,
as well as a rapid coordinating system (the brain and central
nervous system), and rapid-response muscles to correct and
maintain balance, are essential.

Another posture-related observation can be linked to the efﬁciency
of the heart and its potential to sustain high activity levels. Many
birds, mammals, and dinosaurs adopt an upright body posture in
which the head is normally held at levels appreciably higher than
the position of the heart. This difference in head-heart level has
important hydrostatic consequences. Because the head is above the
heart, it has to be capable of pumping blood at high pressure ‘up’
to the brain. But the blood that is pumped at the same time with
each heartbeat from the heart to the lungs must circulate at low
pressure, otherwise it would burst the delicate capillaries that line
the lungs. To permit this pressure difference, the heart in mammals
and birds is physically divided down the middle, so that the left
side of the heart (the systemic, or head and body, circuit) can
run at a higher pressure than the right side (the pulmonary, or
lung, circuit).
All living reptiles carry their head at roughly the same level as their
111

Dinosaurs and warm blood

The brain is central to this whole dynamic ‘problem’ and must
have a constant capacity to work quickly and efﬁciently. This
implies that the body is able to provide constant supplies of oxygen,
food, and heat to allow the chemistry of the brain to work optimally
all the time. The prerequisite for this type of stability is a ‘steady’
endothermic physiology. Ectotherms periodically shut down their
activity levels, when cold, for example, and reduce the supply of
nutrients to the brain, which is consequentially less sophisticated
and closely integrated to overall body functions.

Dinosaurs

heart. Their hearts are not divided down the middle like those of
mammals and birds because there is no need to differentiate
between the systemic and pulmonary circuits. Curiously, the
reptilian heart and circulation offers advantages for these creatures;
they can shunt blood around the body in ways that mammals
cannot. For example, ectotherms spend a lot of time basking in the
sun to warm their bodies. While basking, they can preferentially
shunt blood to the skin, where it can be used to absorb heat (rather
like the water in solar panel central heating pipes). The major
disadvantage of this system is that the blood cannot be circulated
under high pressure – a feature that is essential in any animal that
is behaving very actively and must bring food and oxygen to its
hard-working muscles.
The implication from all these considerations is that dinosaurs,
because of their posture, had a high-pressure blood circulation
system that was compatible with high and sustained activity levels
that are only found in living endotherms. This more comprehensive
and elaborate set of considerations resoundingly supports Richard
Owen’s provocative speculation.
Intimately associated with the efﬁciency of the heart and
circulatory system must be the ability to supply sufﬁcient oxygen
to muscles to allow high levels of aerobic activity. In some groups of
dinosaurs, notably the theropods and the giant sauropodomorphs,
there are some tantalizing anatomical hints concerning lung
structure and function. In both these groups of saurischian
dinosaurs (but not the ornithischians), there are traces of distinct
pouches or cavities (called pleurocoels) in the sides of the vertebrae
of the backbone. In isolation, these might not have attracted
particular attention; however, living birds show similar features
that equate with the presence of extensive air sacs. Air sacs are
part of a bellows-like mechanism that permits birds to breathe
with remarkable efﬁciency. It is highly probable that saurischian
dinosaurs had bird-like, and therefore extremely efﬁcient,
lungs.
112

33. Bird air sacs provide for a highly efﬁcient respiratory system

Dinosaur ‘sophistication’ and brain size
Although the line of argument that follows is not universal to
dinosaurs, it is instructive in the sense that it shows what some
dinosaurs were capable of doing. The classic example is John
Ostrom’s dromaeosaur Deinonychus (Figure 29). As was
summarized in Chapter 2, this dinosaur was a large-eyed visual
predator that could clearly run fast, judging by its limb proportions
and general build. In addition, it had an unusual stiff, narrow tail,
extraordinary gaff-like inner toes on its hind feet, and long, sharply
clawed, grasping arms. It is not unreasonable to suggest that this
animal was built as a pursuit predator, was capable of using its
narrow tail as a dynamic balancing aid (ﬂicking the tail to one side
or the other would allow this animal to change direction extremely
quickly), and very probably leapt at its prey, which it then disabled
113

Dinosaurs and warm blood

This observation certainly supports the contention that some
dinosaurs (theropods and sauropodomorphs) had the ability to
maintain high aerobic activity levels. However, it also highlights
the fact that all dinosaurs (saurischians and ornithischians)
should not be presumed to have been the same in all aspects of
their physiology, because ornithischians show no trace of an
air-sac system.

using the claws on its feet. We have never seen a Deinonychus in
action, but this scenario is based upon observable features of the
skeleton, and is partially supported by one remarkable fossil
discovered in Mongolia.

Dinosaurs

The latter comprises two dinosaurs, the small herbivorous
ceratopian Protoceratops and a close relative of Deinonychus
known as Velociraptor. This extraordinary fossil shows the two
creatures caught in a death struggle; they probably choked to
death in a dust storm while ﬁghting with each other. The
Velociraptor is preserved clinging to the head of its prey using
its long arms, and in the very act of kicking at the throat of its
unfortunate victim.
Such overall ‘sophistication’ in design, inferred function, and way of
life strongly suggests activity levels that are more similar to those
exhibited by modern endotherms.
Echoing some of the argument seen in the discussion concerning
dinosaurs’ ability to move bipedally, the brains of both mammals
and birds are large and both groups exhibit what appears to
be intelligent behaviour. In contrast, ectothermic reptiles
possess smaller brains and are not usually renowned for their
intellectual prowess (though this is in part a ﬁction that we
have propagated). There does, however, appear to be a general
link between overall brain size and endothermy. Large brains
are highly complex structures that demand constant supplies
of oxygen and food, as well as a stable temperature in order to
function efﬁciently. Ectothermic reptiles clearly can supply
both food and oxygen to their brains effectively, but their body
temperature does vary across a normal 24-hour cycle, and as a
consequence they are unable to supply the needs of a large and
sophisticated brain.
Tradition has it that dinosaurs were notoriously lacking in brain
power (the walnut-sized Stegosaurus brain is often cited as a classic
114

example). However, Jim Hopson at the University of Chicago has
done much to rectify this somewhat erroneous view. Comparing the
ratio of brain volume to body volume across a range of animals,
including dinosaurs, Hopson was able to demonstrate that most
dinosaurs had fairly typically reptile-sized brains. Some, however,
were unexpectedly well endowed in the ‘brains department’ – not
surprisingly perhaps, these were the highly active, bipedal
theropods.

Latitudinal distributions

However, upon careful consideration, these observations are
not as persuasive as they seem at ﬁrst sight. Evidence from the
plant fossil record suggests that Mediterranean and subtropical
styles of vegetation existed in these polar regions in Cretaceous
times. Unusually, these plants share the habit of seasonal
leaf loss, probably in response to low winter light levels and
temperatures. The Cretaceous world shows no evidence of
polar ice caps and it seems probable that even at high latitudes,
during the summer season at least, temperatures were extremely
mild. Under such circumstances, it is highly likely that
herbivorous dinosaurs migrated north or south, depending
upon the season, to take advantage of rich pastures. As a
result, discovery of their fossil remains at very high Mesozoic
latitudes may reﬂect their migratory range rather than polar
residency.
115

Dinosaurs and warm blood

Earlier in this chapter it was mentioned that charting distributional
data had been one of the spurs to pursuing the physiological status
of dinosaurs. Recently, reports have shown numbers of dinosaurs in
the Yukon area of North America as well as in Australia and
Antarctica. These areas would have fallen within their respective
polar regions in Cretaceous times, and have been used to support
the idea that dinosaurs must have been endothermic to have
survived. It is, after all, clearly the case today that ectothermic land
vertebrates are incapable of living at such high latitudes.

Ecological considerations

Dinosaurs

Measuring Mesozoic community structure was one of Bakker’s
most innovative suggestions in his search for proxies for
dinosaurian physiology. The idea is beguilingly simple:
endothermic and ectothermic animals require differing amounts of
food in order to survive – these amounts reﬂect the basic ‘running
costs’ associated with being either an endotherm or ectotherm.
Endotherms, such as mammals and birds, have high running costs
because much of the food that they eat (in excess of 80%) is burned
to produce body heat. By contrast, ectotherms need far less food
because very little is used to generate body heat. As a rough guide,
ectotherms need about 10%, sometimes much less, of the food
requirements of similarly sized endotherms.
Based on this observation, and an understanding that the general
economy of Nature tends to keep supply and demand more or less
in balance, Bakker suggested that censuses of fossil communities
might indicate the balance between predator and prey, and by
implication the physiology of these animals. He combed through
museum collections to gather the data he needed. This included
data from ancient (Palaeozoic) reptile, dinosaur (Mesozoic), and
relatively more recent (Cenozoic) mammal communities. His results
seemed encouraging: Palaeozoic reptile communities indicated a
rough equivalence of predator and prey numbers; by contrast,
dinosaur and Cenozoic mammal communities indicated a
preponderance of prey animals and very small numbers of
predators.
At ﬁrst the scientiﬁc community was impressed with these results;
however, considerable doubt now exists about the value of the
original data. Using museum collections to estimate numbers of
predators or prey is an exceedingly dubious exercise: there is no
proof that the animals being counted lived together in the ﬁrst
instance; there are enormous biases in terms of what was (or was
not) collected at the time; and all manner of assumptions are being
116

made about what a predator will or will not eat; and, even if there
was some sort of biological signal, it would surely only apply to the
predator. Additionally, work on communities of living ectotherm
predators and their prey has revealed that the predators may be
as few as 10% of their potential prey numbers, mimicking the
proportions seen in Bakker’s supposedly endotherm communities.
This is an excellent example of a brilliant idea that sadly cannot
be supported because the data simply will not yield results that are
in any way meaningful scientiﬁcally.

Bone histology

In general terms, the mammal and dinosaur bones revealed
high levels of vascularization (they were very porous), while the
ectotherm bones were poorly vascularized. The highly vascularized
type of bone structure can arise in different ways. For example,
one pattern of vascularization (ﬁbrolamellar) reﬂects very rapid
phases of bone growth. Another pattern (Haversian) represents a
phase of strengthening of bone by remodelling that occurs later in
the life of an individual.
What can be said is that many dinosaur remains show evidence of
them having been able to grow quickly, and an ability to strengthen
their bones by internal remodelling. Dinosaurs sometimes exhibit
periodic interruptions in their pattern of growth (which mimics the
117

Dinosaurs and warm blood

Considerable attention has been directed toward understanding
ﬁne details of the internal structure of dinosaur bone. The mineral
structure of dinosaur bone is generally unaffected by fossilization.
As a result, it is often possible to create thin sections of bone that
reveal the internal structure (histology) of the bone in amazing
detail. Preliminary observations suggested that the bones of
dinosaurs were closely similar in internal structure to those seen
in living endothermic mammals, rather than those of modern
ectotherms.

intermittent pattern seen in the bones of living reptiles), but this
style of growth is by no means uniform. Equally, and less probably,
some endotherms (both bird and mammal) exhibit a style of bone
structure (zonal) that displays very little vascularization, while
living ectotherms can exhibit highly vascularized bone in parts of
their skeletons. There are, surprisingly, no clear correlates between
an animal’s physiology and its internal bone structure.

Dinosaur physiology: an overview

Dinosaurs

The discussion above illustrates the range and variety of approaches
that have been used in an attempt to investigate dinosaur
metabolism.
Robert Bakker took an unquestioning stance when assessing the
signiﬁcance of the mammalian replacement by dinosaurs on land in
the Early Jurassic. This pattern, he argued, could only be explained
if dinosaurs were able to compete with his model of the ‘superior’
endothermic mammals: to do so, they simply had to be
endothermic. Is this true? The answer is actually: no . . . not
necessarily.
At the close of the Triassic and very beginning of the Jurassic,
the world was one that we mammalian humans would not ﬁnd
particularly hospitable. Much of Pangaea at the time was affected
by seasonal, but generally arid, conditions in which deserts became
widespread globally. Such conditions of high temperatures and low
rainfall exert selective pressures on endothermic and ectothermic
metabolisms in very different ways.
Ectotherms, as argued above, need to eat less than endotherms
and are therefore better able to survive times of low biological
productivity. Reptiles have scaly skin that greatly resists water loss
in dry, desert conditions; they also do not urinate but instead
excrete a dry, pasty material (similar to bird droppings). High
ambient temperatures suit ectotherms well because their internal
118

chemistry can be maintained at optimum temperatures with
relative ease. All in all, ectotherms, built in the classic reptilian
mould, can be predicted to cope well with desert-like conditions.

Looked at from this purely environmental perspective, perhaps the
Late Triassic/Early Jurassic world was unusual. It was a time when
the environment probably favoured ectotherms and restricted early
mammals to small size and primarily nocturnal niches. In deserts
today, nearly all mammals (with the exception of those truly
remarkable creatures known as camels) are small, exclusively
nocturnal rodents and insectivores. They survive the extreme heat
of the day by burrowing under the sand surface, where conditions
are cooler and more damp, and they come out at night once the
119

Dinosaurs and warm blood

Endotherms, such as mammals, are physiologically stressed in
high-temperature conditions. Mammals are ‘geared’ to being able
to lose heat to the environment from their bodies (their bodily
thermostats maintain their temperature on average higher than
normal environmental conditions) and adjust their physiology
accordingly. When cold, mammals are able to reduce heat loss from
the body by raising their fur to trap air and increase its insulatory
efﬁciency, use ‘shivering’ to quickly generate extra muscular heat, or
raise their basal metabolic rate. However, under conditions of high
ambient temperature, the need to lose heat to the environment to
prevent lethal overheating becomes vital. Evaporative cooling is one
of the few options available; this is achieved either by panting or
sweating through the skin surface. Both of these processes remove
large volumes of water from the body. In desert conditions, losing
water, which is in short supply, can prove fatal. To compound
matters further, mammals remove the breakdown products of their
metabolism from the body by urinating, which ﬂushes wastes out of
the body in a watery solution. In addition to the problems of heat
load and water loss, mammals require large quantities of food to
maintain their endothermic physiology. Deserts are areas of low
productivity, so food supplies are restricted and not capable of
sustaining large populations of endotherms.

Dinosaurs

temperature has dropped and they can use their acute senses to ﬁnd
insect prey.
The striking aridity of the Late Triassic/Early Jurassic eventually
ameliorated, as Pangaea began to disintegrate and shallow
epicontinental seas spread across and between areas of land.
The general climatic regime appears to have become extremely
warm and wet, and these conditions prevailed across very broad
latitudinal bands. It should be emphasized that there were no
ice-covered polar regions throughout the time of the dinosaurs.
The type of world we inhabit today is very unusual, when compared
to much of the history of the Earth, in that it has both north and
south poles covered in ice and consequently unusually narrowly
conﬁned latitudinal climatic bands. Under these relatively lush
Jurassic conditions, productivity rose dramatically; major Jurassic
coal deposits were laid down in areas where long-lived and
densely forested areas existed. So it is perhaps not surprising to
discover that the range and variety of dinosaurs surged during
Jurassic times.

Dinosaur physiology: was it unique?
Dinosaurs are noteworthy as being large creatures; even mediumsized ones ranged between 5 and 10 metres in length, which is still
very big by most standards – the average size of all mammals is
probably about the size of a cat or small dog today. It is certainly
true that no dinosaurs were mouse-sized (except as hatchlings).
Under some conditions, being large has advantages. Most notably,
larger animals tend to lose heat to and gain heat from the
environment very much more slowly than small ones. For example,
adult crocodiles maintain a very stable internal body temperature
day and night, whereas hatchlings exhibit a body temperature
range that exactly mirrors the day and night changes. So, being
dinosaur-sized means that your internal body temperature changes
little over time. Being large also means that postural muscles need
120

to work hard to prevent the body from collapsing under its own
weight. This constant muscular ‘work’ generates signiﬁcant
quantities of energy (in the same way that we become ‘ﬂushed’ with
heat after muscular exercise), and this heat can assist in
maintaining internal body temperature.

Considering these factors alone, it seems very likely that dinosaurs
possessed many of the attributes that we associate today with
endothermy as seen in living mammals and birds. In addition,
dinosaurs were typically large and therefore relatively thermally
inert. They also lived during a time of constantly warm,
non-seasonal, global climate.
It could be the case that dinosaurs were the happy inheritors of an
ideal type of biology that enabled them to prosper in the unique
climatic conditions that prevailed in the Mesozoic Era. But,
however convincing this argument might seem at this point, it does
not take into account one other crucial line of evidence that has
emerged over the last few years: the intimacy of dinosaur–bird
relationships.

121

Dinosaurs and warm blood

In addition to these advantages of size, we have seen that the
probable agility as well as posture of dinosaurs, many with heads
raised signiﬁcantly above chest level, indicates the strong likelihood
that they had highly efﬁcient, fully divided hearts that were capable
of rapidly circulating oxygen, food, and heat around the body, as
well as removing harmful metabolism by-products. The fact that
saurischian dinosaurs probably possessed a bird-like lung system
further emphasizes their ability to provide the oxygen that their
tissues needed during energetic, aerobic exercise.

Chapter 6
What if . . . birds
are dinosaurs?

Following on from John Ostrom’s inspired work in the 1970s, the
anatomical evidence for a relationship between dinosaurs and
birds is now so detailed that it is possible to reconstruct the stages
by which a dromaeosaurian theropod might be transformed into an
early bird.
Early small-sized theropods, such as Compsognathus, have a birdlike appearance – long, spindly legs; a long neck; and fairly small
head with quite large, forward-pointing eyes – though they still
retain obviously dinosaurian features, such as the clawed hands,
teeth in the jaws, and a long, bulky tail.

Dromaeosaurian theropods
These bird-like dinosaurs exhibit a number of interesting
anatomical changes to the basic theropod body plan. Some changes
are quite subtle, but others are less so.
One notable feature is the ‘thinning’ of the tail: the tail becomes
very narrow and stiffened by bundles of long, thin bones, the only
ﬂexible part being close to the hips (Figure 16, top). As argued
earlier, this thin, pole-like tail may well have been valuable as a
dynamic stabilizer to assist with the capture of fast-moving and
elusive prey. However, this type of tail dramatically changed the
122

pose of these animals because it was no longer a heavy, muscular
cantilever for the front half of the body. If no other changes had
been made to its posture, such a dinosaur would have been
unbalanced and constantly pitch forward on to its nose!

Another equally subtle way of compensating for the loss of the
counterbalancing tail would be to shorten the chest in front of the
hips, and this is also seen in these bird-like theropods. The chest
also shows signs of being stiffened, and this probably reﬂects the
predatory habits of these animals. The long arms and three-clawed
hands were important for catching and subduing their prey and
needed to be very powerful. The chest region was no doubt
strengthened to help securely anchor the arms and shoulders to
withstand the large forces associated with grappling and subduing
prey. Birds also have a short, and greatly stiffened, chest region to
withstand the forces associated with anchoring the powerful ﬂight
muscles.
At the front of the chest, between the shoulder joints, there is a
V-shaped bone (which is in fact the fused clavicles, or collar bones –
Figure 17) that acts as a spring-like spacer separating the shoulders,
it also helped to anchor the shoulders in place while these animals
were wrestling their prey. Birds also exhibit fused collar bones; they
form the elongate ‘wish bone’, or furcula, that similarly acts as a
123

What if . . . birds are dinosaurs?

To compensate for the loss of the heavy tail, the bodies of these
theropods were subtly altered: the pubic bone, which marks the
rearmost part of the gut and normally points forward and
downward from each hip socket in theropods, was rotated
backwards so that it lay parallel to the ischium (the other lower
hip bone). Because of this change in orientation, the gut and
associated organs could be swung backwards to lie beneath the
hips. This change shifted the weight of the body backwards, and
compensated for the loss of the heavy counterbalancing tail. This
layout of hip bones, with the pubis rotated backward, is seen in
living and fossil birds as well as maniraptoran theropods.

Dinosaurs

mechanical spring that separates the shoulder joints during
ﬂapping ﬂight.
The joints between the bones of the arm and hand were also
modiﬁed so that they could be swung outward and downward with
considerable speed and force to strike at prey in what has been
called a ‘raking’ action. When not in use, the arms could be folded
neatly against the body. The leverage for this system was also of
considerable advantage to these creatures, because the arm muscles
that powered this mechanism were located close to the chest and
operated long tendons that ran down the arm to the hand (rather
than having muscles positioned further out along the arm); this
remote control system kept the weight of the body closer to the hips
and helped to minimize the delicate problem of balance in these
theropods. The arm-striking and arm-folding mechanism is closely
similar to that employed by birds when opening and closing their
wings during and after ﬂight.

Archaeopteryx
The early bird-like fossil Archaeopteryx (Figure 16, bottom) exhibits
many maniraptoran theropod features: the tail is a long and very
thin set of vertebrae that anchored the tail feathers on either side;
the hip bones are arranged with the pubis pointing backward and
downward; at the front of the chest there is a boomerang-like
furcula; the jaws are lined with small, spiky teeth, rather than a
more typical bird-like horny beak; the arms are long, jointed so that
they can be extended and folded just as in theropods, and the hands
are equipped with three sharply clawed ﬁngers that in their
arrangement and proportions are identical to those seen in
maniraptoran theropods.
Specimens of Archaeopteryx were preserved as fossils under
exceptional circumstances that enabled an array of exquisitely
delineated ﬂight feather impressions to be seen. These are attached
to the wings and along the sides of the tail and dictate that this
124

creature is deﬁned as a bird: feathers are regarded as unique to
birds, and therefore indicate its afﬁnity beyond any question. This is
one of the reasons why Archaeopteryx is considered to be such an
important fossil, and why it has been the focus of this comparison.
Had chance not led to the preservation of feathers in this instance,
it is tempting to wonder how this creature might have been
classiﬁed. It would very probably have been redescribed in recent
years as an unusually small, dromaeosaurian theropod!

Chinese wonders
During the 1990s, explorations in quarries in Liaoning Province
in north-eastern China began to yield some extraordinary, and
extraordinarily well preserved, fossils of Early Cretaceous age. At
ﬁrst, these comprised beautifully preserved early birds such as
Confuciusornis, and the skeletons included impressions of feathers,
125

What if . . . birds are dinosaurs?

34. Restoration of the living Archaeopteryx

Dinosaurs

beaks, and claws. Then in 1996, a complete skeleton of a small
theropod dinosaur, very similar in anatomy and proportions to
the well known theropod Compsognathus (Figure 14), was
described by Ji Qiang and Ji Shu’an. They named the dinosaur
Sinosauropteryx. This dinosaur was remarkable because there was
a fringe of ﬁlamentous structures along its backbone and across its
body, suggesting some sort of covering to the skin that was akin to
the ‘pile’ on a roughly made carpet; there was also evidence of soft
tissues in the eye socket and in the region of the gut. It was clear
that some small theropods had some type of body covering. These
discoveries led to concerted efforts to ﬁnd more such fossils at
Liaoning; they began to appear with increasing regularity and
ushered in some truly breathtaking revelations.
Shortly after Sinosauropteryx was discovered, another skeleton
was revealed. This animal, named Protoarchaeopteryx, was the
ﬁrst to show the presence of true bird-like feathers attached to its
tail and along the sides of its body, and its anatomy was much
more similar to that of dromaeosaurians than Sinosauropteryx.
Another discovery revealed an animal that was extremely similar
to Velociraptor, but this time named Sinornithosaurus (again,
apparently covered in a ‘pile’ of short ﬁlaments). Newer discoveries
have included Caudipteryx, a large (turkey-sized), rather
short-armed creature noted for a pronounced tuft of tail feathers
and shorter fringes of feathers along its arms; smaller, heavily
feathered dromaeosaurians; and in the spring of 2003 a quite
remarkable ‘four-winged’ dromaeosaurian, Microraptor, was
unveiled to the world. This latter creature was small and classically
dromaeosaur-like, with the typically long, narrow tail, bird-like
pelvis, long, grasping arms, and sharp rows of teeth lining its
jaws. The tail was fringed by primary feathers and its body
covered in downy ones. However, what was singularly impressive
was the preservation along the arms of ﬂight feathers forming
Archaeopteryx-like wings and, very unexpectedly, similar wing-like
fringes of feathers attached to the lower parts of the legs – hence the
name ‘four-wing’.
126

Such has been the avalanche of new, ever more startling discoveries
from the quarries in Liaoning over such a short space of time that it
is almost impossible to imagine what might be discovered next.

Birds, theropods, and the question of
dinosaur physiology
The stunning new discoveries from Liaoning contribute
importantly to the earlier discussion about the biology and
physiology of dinosaurs; but, as ever, they do not answer quite as
many questions as we would wish.

It is also quite obvious that a considerable diversity of feathered
theropods and what we today recognize as genuine birds (ones with
a well-developed ﬂight apparatus) coexisted during Jurassic and
Cretaceous times. Archaeopteryx is late Jurassic (155 Ma) in age
and was clearly feathered and bird-like. However, we now know
for certain that during the younger Cretaceous (c. 120 Ma) a
multiplicity of these types of ‘dinobirds’, such as Microraptor and
its relatives, existed alongside true birds. The sheer diversity, or
127

What if . . . birds are dinosaurs?

First and foremost, it is now clear that our Victorian predecessors
were not correct: feathers do not, after all, make a bird. Various
sorts of skin coverings appear to have been present on a wide range
of theropod dinosaurs, ranging from a shaggy, ﬁlamentous type of
covering, through downy, feather-like body coverings, to fully
formed contour and ﬂight feathers. The discoveries at Liaoning
force us to wonder just how widespread such body coverings might
have been, not only among theropods, but, perhaps, even in other
dinosaur groups as well. Given the known distribution of body
coverings, it is not unreasonable to ponder the probability of giants
such as Tyrannosaurus rex (which was a theropod related to
Sinosauropteryx) having some sort of epidermal covering – even if
only as juveniles. Such tantalizing questions cannot be answered
at present, and require the discovery of new geological deposits
similar in quality of fossil preservation to those at Liaoning.

biological exuberance, of these ‘dinobirds’ is rather bewildering, and
to some extent obscures the evolutionary origins of the true birds
that we see around today.
From a physiological perspective, however, the proof of the
existence of theropod dinosaurs with some sort of insulatory
covering points very conclusively toward the fact that these
dinosaurs (at least) were genuine endotherms. There are two
reasons for believing this:

Dinosaurs

i)

ii)

Many of these feathered dinosaurs were small-bodied (20–40
centimetres long) and, as we know, small animals have a relatively
large surface area and lose body heat to the environment very
quickly. Therefore insulation using ﬁlaments (which mimic the fur
seen on the bodies of living mammals) and downy feathers are
likely to have been a necessity if these creatures generated internal
body heat.
Equally, the possession of an outer insulatory layer to the skin
would have made basking difﬁcult, if not impossible, because the
insulatory layer would have inhibited their ability to gain heat from
the sun. Basking is the ectotherm’s way of gaining body heat, so a
furry or feathered lizard is a biological impossibility.

Birds from dinosaurs: an evolutionary commentary
The implications of these new discoveries are truly fascinating. It
has already been argued, with logic and some force, that small
theropod dinosaurs were highly active, fast-moving, and
biologically ‘sophisticated’ animals. On this basis, they seemed
reasonable candidates as potential endotherms; in a sense, our
inferences about their way of life suggested that they had most to
beneﬁt from being endothermic. The Liaoning discoveries conﬁrm
that many of these highly active, bird-like dinosaurs were small
animals. This is a crucial point, as small size puts greatest
physiological stress on endotherms because a large percentage of
internally generated body heat can be lost through the skin surface;
128

so small, active endotherms would be expected to insulate their
bodies to reduce heat loss. Small theropod dinosaurs, therefore,
evolved insulation to prevent heat loss because they were
endotherms – not because they ‘wanted’ to become birds!

In this context, gliding and ﬂight, rather than being the sine qua
non of avian origins, become later, ‘add-on’ beneﬁts. Obviously,
feathers have the potential for aerodynamic uses; just as with
modern birds, the ability to jump and ﬂutter may well have
embellished ‘dinobird’ mating displays. For example, in the case of
the small creature Microraptor, a combination of fringes of feathers
along the arms, legs, and tail would have provided it with the ability
to launch itself into the air from branches or equivalent vantage
points. From just this sort of starting point, gliding and true
ﬂapping ﬂight seem a comparatively short ‘step’ indeed.

Persistent problems
We should not, however, get too carried away with the scenario
outlined above. Although the Liaoning discoveries are indeed
129

What if . . . birds are dinosaurs?

Liaoning discoveries indicate that various types of insulatory
covering developed, most probably by subtle modiﬁcations to the
growth patterns of normal skin scales; these ranged from hair-like
ﬁlaments to full-blown feathers. It may well be that genuinely
bird-like ﬂight feathers did not evolve for the purposes of ﬂight,
but had a far more prosaic origin. Several of the ‘dinobirds’ from
Liaoning seem to have tufts of feathers on the end of the tail (rather
like a geisha’s fan) and fringes of feathers along the arms, on the
head, or running down the spine. Clearly preservational biases may
also play a part in how and on which parts of the body these may
be preserved. But for the present, it seems at least possible that
feathers evolved as structures linked to the behaviour of these
animals: providing recognition signals, perhaps, as in living birds,
or being used as part of their mating rituals, long before any
genuine ﬂight function had developed.

Dinosaurs

incredibly important, offering, as they do, a richly detailed window
on dinosaurian and avian evolution in the Cretaceous, they do not
necessarily provide all the answers. One crucial point that must be
remembered is that the quarries of Liaoning are Early Cretaceous in
age, and their fossils are therefore considerably younger (by some
30 Ma at least) than the earliest well-preserved feathered dinosaur
with highly developed and complex wings, Archaeopteryx.
Whatever the path that led to the evolution of the ﬁrst ﬂying
dinosaurs, and ultimately to birds, it was emphatically not via the
extraordinary feathered dinosaurs from Liaoning. What we see at
Liaoning is a snap shot of the evolutionary diversiﬁcation of avian
theropods (and some true birds), not the origin of birds: bird
origins are still shrouded by sediments of Middle or possibly even
Early Jurassic age – before Archaeopteryx ever ﬂuttered to Earth.
Everything that we know to date points to a very close relationship
between theropod dinosaurs and early birds, but those crucial Early
or Middle Jurassic theropods that were ancestral to Archaeopteryx
are yet to be discovered. It is to be hoped that in future years some
spectacular discoveries will be made that ﬁll in this part of the
story.
Chapter 5 concluded with the view that dinosaurs lived at a time in
Earth history that favoured large-bodied, highly active creatures
that were able to maintain a stable, high body temperature without
most of the costs of being genuinely endothermic. The ‘dinobirds’
from Liaoning suggest that this view is wrong – small, insulated
theropods simply had to be endothermic and their close
relationship to birds, which we know are endothermic, simply
reinforces the point.
My response to this is: well, yes and no. There is now little doubt
that bird-like theropod dinosaurs were endotherms in a true sense.
However, I do think that the arguments suggesting that the
majority of more traditional dinosaurs were inertial homeotherms
(their large body size enabled stable internal temperature) still hold.
There is some evidence in support of my view to be found among
130

living endotherms. Elephants, for example, have a much lower
metabolic rate than mice – for exactly these reasons. Mice are small,
lose heat rapidly to the environment, and have to maintain a high
metabolic rate to replenish the heat loss. Elephants are large
(generally dinosaur-sized) and have a stable internal body
temperature due to their size, not just because they are
endothermic. Indeed, being a large endotherm is, in part at least, a
physiological challenge. For example, elephants suffer problems if
they move around too quickly: their postural and leg muscles create
a great deal of extra chemical heat, and they need to use their large,
‘ﬂappy’ ears to help them to radiate heat rapidly to prevent fatal
overheating.

It is clear, from their anatomy alone, that dromaeosaurians were
highly active and would have beneﬁted from homeothermy, and
their relatively large brains would have demanded a constant supply
of oxygen and nutrients. Paradoxically, homeothermy cannot be
maintained at small body size without an insulatory covering
because of the unsustainable heat loss through the skin. The choice
was stark and simple: small theropods had to either abandon their
high-activity lifestyle and become conventionally reptilian, or boost
internal heat production and become properly endothermic,
avoiding heat loss by developing skin insulation. So, I propose that
it is not a case of ‘all or nothing’; most dinosaurs were basically
mass-homeotherms that were able to sustain high activity levels
131

What if . . . birds are dinosaurs?

Dinosaurs were on the whole super-large and their bodies would
have been capable of maintaining a constant internal temperature;
extrapolating from the elephant, it would not have been in
dinosaurs’ interests to be genuine endotherms, in a world that
was in any case very warm. Having evolved physiologically as
mass-homeotherms (having a stable internal body temperature
that was made possible by large body size), the only group of
dinosaurs that bucked the general dinosaurian trend toward large
size and evolved into a small-bodied group were the
dromaeosaurian theropods.

Dinosaurs

without the full costs of mammalian or avian styles of endothermy;
however, the small, and in particular the dromaeosaurian,
theropods (and their descendants, the true birds) were obliged to
develop full-blown endothermy and the associated insulatory
covering.

Chapter 7
Dinosaur research:
observation and deduction

In this chapter, a variety of lines of investigation are explored to
reinforce the message that a multiplicity of approaches must be
used if we are to comprehend the lives of fossil animals.

Dinosaur ichnology
Some aspects of dinosaur research have an almost sleuth-like
quality to them, perhaps none more so than ichnology – the study
of footprints.
There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so
much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.
(Conan Doyle, The Study in Scarlet, 1891)

The study of dinosaur footprints has a surprisingly long history.
Some of the ﬁrst to be collected and exhibited were found in
1802 in Massachusetts by the young Pliny Moody while
ploughing a ﬁeld. These and other large three-toed prints were
eventually illustrated and described by Edward Hitchcock in 1836
as the tracks left by gigantic birds; some can still be seen in the
Pratt Museum of Amherst College. From the mid-19th century
onwards, tracks were discovered at fairly regular intervals in
various parts of the world. With the development of an
understanding of the anatomy of dinosaurs, and most particularly
133

Dinosaurs

the shape of their feet, it was realized that the large ‘bird-like’
three-toed prints that were found in Mesozoic rocks belonged to
dinosaurs rather than giant birds. Such tracks, though of local
interest, were rarely regarded as of great scientiﬁc value.
However, in recent years, largely prompted by the work of Martin
Lockley of the University of Colorado at Denver, it has begun to be
appreciated more widely that tracks may provide a great deal of
information.
First, and most obviously, preserved tracks record the activities of
living dinosaurs. Individual prints also record the overall shape of
the foot and the number of toes, which can often help to narrow
down the likely trackmaker, especially if dinosaur skeletons have
been discovered in similarly aged rocks nearby. While individual
prints may be intrinsically interesting, a series of tracks provides a
record of how the creature was actually moving. They reveal the
orientation of the feet as they contact the ground, the length of the
stride, the width of the track (how closely the right and left feet
were spaced); from this evidence, it is possible to reconstruct how
the legs moved in a mechanical sense. Furthermore, taking
observations using data from a wide range of living animals it has
also proved possible to calculate the speeds at which animals
leaving tracks were moving. These estimates are arrived at by
simply measuring the size of the prints and length of each stride and
making an estimate of the length of the leg. Although the latter
might seem at ﬁrst sight difﬁcult to estimate with great accuracy,
the actual size of the footprints has proved to be a remarkably good
guide ( judging by living animals), and in some instances foot and
leg bones or skeletons of dinosaurs that lived at the time the tracks
were made are known.
The shape of individual tracks may also reveal information relevant
to deducing how such animals were moving: relatively ﬂat, broad
prints indicate that the whole foot was in contact with the ground
for quite a long time, suggesting that it was moving relatively
slowly; in other instances, the tracks may just show the tips of the
134

Dinosaur research

35. Parallel rows of tracks made by a group of sauropod dinosaurs as
they travelled across a moist lowland plain

toes making contact with the ground – suggesting that the animal
was quite literally sprinting on the tips of its toes.
Another interesting aspect of dinosaur tracks relates to the
circumstances that led to them being preserved at all. Tracks will
not be preserved on hard ground, instead it needs to be relatively
soft and usually moist, and ideally of a muddy consistency. Once the
prints have been made, it is then important that they are not greatly
135

Dinosaurs

disturbed before they solidify; this can happen if the prints are
buried quickly beneath another layer of mud, because the surface
becomes baked hard in the sun, or through the rapid precipitation
of minerals that form a kind of cement within the footprint layer.
Very frequently, it is possible to deduce from details of the sediment
in which the tracks were made exactly what the conditions were like
when the dinosaur left its tracks. This can range from the degree to
which the mud was disturbed by the feet of the animal and how
deeply the feet sank into the sediment, to how the sediment seems
to have responded to the movements of the foot. Sometimes it can
be seen that a creature was moving up or down slopes simply from
the way sediment is scuffed up in front of, or behind, the main
footprint. Tracks left by dinosaurs can therefore offer a great deal of
information about not only how dinosaurs moved, but the types of
environments that they moved in.
The study of tracks can also reveal information about dinosaur
behaviour. On rare occasions, multiple tracks of dinosaurs have
been discovered. One famous example, recorded in the Paluxy River
at Glen Rose in Texas, was revealed by a famous dinosaur footprint
explorer named Roland T. Bird. Two parallel tracks were found at
this site, one made by a huge brontosaur and the other by a large
carnivorous dinosaur. The tracks seemed to show the big carnivore
tracks converging on the brontosaur. At the intersection of the
tracks, one print is missing, and Bird suspected that this indicated
the point of attack. However, Lockley was able to show from maps
of the track site that the brontosaurs (there were several) continued
walking beyond the supposed point of attack; and, even though the
large theropod was following the brontosaur (some of its prints
overlap those of the brontosaur), there is no sign of a ‘scufﬂe’. Very
probably this predator was simply tracking potential prey animals
by following at a safe distance. More convincing were some tracks
observed by Bird at Davenport Ranch, also in Texas. Here he was
able to log the tracks of 23 brontosaur-like sauropods walking in the
same direction at the same time (Figure 35). This suggested very
strongly that some dinosaurs moved around in herds. Herding or
136

gregarious behaviour is impossible to deduce from skeletons, but
tracks provide direct evidence.

If herds of such enormous creatures trampled over areas, as they
certainly did at Davenport Ranch, then they also had the capacity to
greatly disturb the earth beneath – pounding it up and destroying
its normal sedimentary structure. This relatively recently
recognized phenomenon has been named ‘dinoturbation’.
‘Dinoturbation’ might be a geological phenomenon, but it hints at
another distinctly biological effect linked to dinosaur activities that
may or may not be measurable over time. That is the potential
evolutionary and ecological impact of dinosaurs on terrestrial
communities at large. Great herds of multitonne dinosaurs moving
across a landscape had the potential to utterly devastate the local
ecology. We are aware that elephants today are capable of causing
considerable damage to the African savannah because of the way
that they can tear up and knock down mature trees. What might a
herd of 40-tonne brontosaurs have done? And did this type of
137

Dinosaur research

Increased interest in dinosaur tracks in recent years has brought to
light a number of potentially interesting avenues of research.
Dinosaur tracks have sometimes been found in areas that have not
yielded skeletal remains of dinosaurs, so tracks can help to ﬁll in
particular gaps in the known fossil record of dinosaurs. Interesting
geological concepts have also emerged from a consideration of
dinosaur track properties. Some of the large sauropodomorph
dinosaurs (the brontosaurs referred to above) may have weighed as
much as 20–40 tonnes in life. These animals would have exerted
enormous forces on the ground when they walked. On soft
substrate, the pressure from the feet of such dinosaurs would have
distorted the earth at a depth of a metre or more beneath the
surface – creating a series of ‘underprints’ formed as echoes of the
original footprint on the surface. The spectre of ‘underprints’ means
that some dinosaur tracks might be considerably over-represented
in the fossil record if a single print can be replicated through
numerous ‘underprints’.

destructive activity have an effect upon the other animals and plants
living at the time; can we identify or measure such impacts in the
long term, and were they important in the evolutionary history of
the Mesozoic?

Dinosaurs

Coprolites
Another slightly less romantic branch of palaeobiological
investigation focuses on the dung of animals such as dinosaurs.
This material is refered to as coprolites (copros means dung, lithos
means stone), and their study has a surprisingly long and relatively
illustrious history. The recognition of the importance of preserved
dung dates back to the work of William Buckland of Oxford
University (the man who described the ﬁrst dinosaur,
Megalosaurus). A pioneering geologist from the ﬁrst half of the
19th century, Buckland spent considerable time collecting and
studying rocks and fossils from his native area around Lyme Regis
in Dorset, including fossil marine reptiles. Alongside these,
Buckland noted large numbers of distinctive pebbles that often had
a faint spiral shape. On closer inspection, breaking them open and
looking at polished sections, Buckland was able to identify shiny
ﬁsh scales, bones, and the sharp hooks of belemnite (a cephalopod
mollusc) tentacles in great concentrations. He concluded that these
stones were most probably the lithiﬁed excreta of the predatory
reptiles found in the same rocks. Clearly, though at ﬁrst sight
somewhat distasteful, the study of coprolites had the potential to
reveal evidence concerning the diet of the once-living creature that
would not otherwise be obtainable.
As was the case with footprints, the question ‘who did this?’, though
obviously amusing, can present signiﬁcant problems. Occasionally,
coprolites, or indeed gut contents, have been preserved inside the
bodies of some fossil vertebrates (notably ﬁsh); however, it has been
difﬁcult to connect coprolite fossils to speciﬁc dinosaurs or even
groups of dinosaurs. Karen Chin of the US Geological Survey has
devoted herself to the study of coprolites and has had singular
138

difﬁculty in reliably identifying dinosaur coprolites – until quite
recently.

Dinosaur pathologies
The conﬁrmation of a diet of meat in T. rex is clearly not entirely
unexpected, given the overall anatomy of such theropods. However,
an interesting pathological consequence of a diet rich in red meat
has also been detected in the skeleton of Tyrannosaurus.
139

Dinosaur research

In 1998, Chin and colleagues were able to report the discovery of
what they referred to in the title of their article as ‘A king-sized
theropod coprolite’. The specimen in question was discovered in
Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) sediments in Saskatchewan and
comprised a rather nobbly lump of material, over 40 centimetres
long, that had a volume of approximately 2.5 litres. Immediately
around and inside the specimen were broken fragments of bone,
and a ﬁner, sand-like powder of bone material was present
throughout the mass. Chemical analysis of the specimen conﬁrmed
that it had very high levels of calcium and phosphorous, conﬁrming
a high concentration of bone material. Histological thin sections of
the fragments further conﬁrmed the cellular structure of bone and
that the most likely prey items that had been digested were
dinosaurian;as suspected, this specimen was most likely a large
carnivore’s coprolite. Surveying the fauna known from the rocks in
this area, the only creature that was large enough to have been able
to pass a coprolite of these dimensions was the large theropod
Tyrannosaurus rex (‘king’ of the dinosaurs). Examination of the
bone fragments preserved in the coprolite showed that this animal
had been able to pulverize the bones of its prey in its mouth, and
that the most likely prey was a juvenile ceratopian ornithischian
(from the structure of the bone in the histological sections). The fact
that not all the bone had been digested in this coprolite indicated
that the material had moved through the gut with considerable
speed, which could be used by some as evidence that T. rex was
perhaps a hungry endotherm.

Dinosaurs

‘Sue’, the large skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex now on display at the
Field Museum in Chicago, is of interest because of the presence of
various pathological features. One of its ﬁnger bones (metacarpals)
exhibits some characteristic, smoothly rounded pits at the joint with
its ﬁrst ﬁnger bone; these were subjected to detailed examination
by modern-day pathologists as well as palaeontologists. The
palaeontologists discovered that other tyrannosaurs also exhibit
such lesions, but that these are quite rare in museum collections.
The pathologist was able to conﬁrm, following detailed comparison
with pathologies from living reptiles and birds, that the lesions were
the result of gout. This illness, also known in humans, generally
affects the feet and hands, and is extremely painful, causing
swelling and inﬂammation of the areas involved. It is caused by the
deposition of urate crystals around the joints. Although gout can be
a result of dehydration or of kidney failure, a factor in humans is
diet: ingesting food rich in purine, a chemical found in red meat. So,
Tyrannosaurus not only looked like a meat-eater, its faeces prove it,
and so does one of the diseases it suffered from.
‘Sue’ also displays a large number of more conventional pathologies.
These are the tell-tale remains of past injuries. When bones are
broken during life, they have the capacity to heal themselves.
Although modern surgical techniques enable repair of broken
bones with considerable precision, in Nature the broken ends of the
bone do not usually align themselves precisely, and a callous forms
around the area where the ends of bone meet. Such imperfections in
the repair process leave marks on the skeleton that can be detected
after death. It is clear that ‘Sue’ suffered a number of injuries during
‘her’ life. On one occasion, ‘she’ experienced a major trauma to the
chest, which exhibits several clearly broken and repaired ribs. In
addition, ‘her’ spine and tail show a number of breakages that,
again, healed during life.
The surprising aspect of these observations is that an animal such
as T. rex was clearly able to survive periods of injury and sickness. It
might be predicted that a large predator such as T. rex would
140

become extremely vulnerable and therefore potential prey itself
once it was injured. That this did not happen (at least in the
instance of ‘Sue’) suggests either that such animals were
extraordinarily durable and therefore not unduly affected by quite
serious trauma, or that these dinosaurs may have lived in socially
cohesive groups that might have acted cooperatively on occasion to
assist an injured individual.

Examination and X-radiography of the fossil bone revealed that the
site of the original injury must have become infected, but that
rather than remaining localized the infection spread down the
marrow cavity of the shin bone, partially destroying the bone as it
went. As the infection spread, extra bony tissue was added to the
exterior of the bone as if the body was trying to create its own ‘splint’
or support. It is clear that the animal’s immune system was unable
to prevent the continued spread of infection, and large abscesses
formed beneath the outer bony sheath; the pus from these must
have leaked through from the leg bones and may have run out on to
the surface of the skin as a sore. Judging by the amount of bone
growth around the site of infection, it seems likely that the animal
141

Dinosaur research

Other pathologies have also been noted in various dinosaurs. These
range from destructive bone lesions resulting from periodontal
abscesses (in the case of jaw bones), or septic arthritis and
chronic osteomyelitis in other parts of the skull or skeleton. One
particularly unpleasant example of long-term infection of a leg
wound was recorded in a small ornithopod. The partial skeleton
of this animal was discovered in Early Cretaceous sediments in
south-eastern Australia. The hindlimbs and pelvis were well
preserved, but the lower part of the left leg was grossly distorted
and shortened (Figure 36). Although the original cause of the
subsequent infection could not be proved, it was suspected that the
animal may have received a severe bite on the shin close to the knee
of its left leg. As a result, the fossilized bones of the shin (tibia and
ﬁbula) were severely overgrown by a huge, irregular, callous-like
mass of bone.

36. Septic fossilized dinosaur shin bones have become grossly distorted

lived for as much as a year, while suffering from this horribly
crippling injury, before it ﬁnally succumbed. The preserved skeleton
shows no other sign of pathological infection, and there is no
indication of tooth marks or other scavenging activity because its
bones were not scattered.

Quite why tumours should be so restricted is puzzling. Rothschild
was moved to wonder whether the diets of hadrosaurs may
have had a bearing on this epidemiology. Rare discoveries of
‘mummiﬁed’ carcasses of hadrosaurs show accumulations
of material in the gut that include considerable quantities
of conifer tissue; these plants contain high concentrations of
tumour-inducing chemicals. Whether this provides evidence
either for a genetic predisposition to cancer among hadrosaurs,
or for environmental induction (a mutagenic diet), is entirely
speculative at present.

Isotopes
Another branch of science known as geochemistry has been using
radioactive isotopes of oxygen, particularly oxygen-16 and
oxygen-18, and their proportions in chemicals (carbonates) found
143

Dinosaur research

Tumours have only rarely been recognized in dinosaur bones.
The most obvious drawback with trying to study the frequency of
cancers in dinosaurs has been the need to destroy dinosaurian bone
in order to make histological sections – obviously something that
has little appeal to museum curators. Recently, Bruce Rothschild
has developed a technique for scanning dinosaur bones using
X-rays and ﬂuoroscopy. The technique is limited to bones less than
28 centimetres in diameter, and for this reason he surveyed large
numbers (over 10,000) of dinosaur vertebrae. The vertebrae came
from representatives of all the major dinosaur groups from a large
number of museum collections. He discovered that cancers were
not only very rare (<0.2% to 3%) but also limited exclusively to
hadrosaurs.

Dinosaurs

in the shells of microscopic marine organisms, to estimate the
temperature of ancient oceans, and therefore larger-scale climatic
conditions. Basically, the understanding is that the higher the
proportion of oxygen-18 (compared to oxygen-16) locked into
the chemicals of the shells of these organisms, the colder the
temperature of the ocean in which the organisms originally lived.
In the early 1990s, a palaeontologist, Reese Barrick, and a
geochemist, William Showers, joined forces to see if it might be
possible to do the same for the chemicals in bones – particularly the
oxygen that forms part of the phosphate molecule in bone minerals.
They ﬁrst applied this approach to some known vertebrates (cows
and lizards) by taking samples of bones from different parts of the
body (ribs, legs, and tail) and measured the oxygen isotope
proportions. Their results showed that for the endothermic
mammal (cow) there was very little difference in the body
temperature between the bones of the legs and ribs; as might be
expected, the animal had a constant body temperature. In the
lizard, however, the tail was between 2 and 9°C lower than its
ribs; the ectotherm did not have such an even distribution of
body heat, with the peripheral parts on average cooler than the
body core.
Barrick and Showers then performed a similar analysis on various
bones from a well-preserved T. rex skeleton collected in Montana.
Drilled samples from ribs, leg, toe, and tail bones revealed a rather
mammal-like result: the oxygen isotope ratios differed very little,
indicating that the body had a fairly even temperature throughout.
This was used to promote further the idea that dinosaurs were not
only homeothermic but also that they were endothermic. More
recent work by these authors seems to conﬁrm their basic ﬁnding,
and has extended this observation to a range of other dinosaurs,
including hadrosaurs.
As is often the case, these results generated a lively discussion.
There were concerns that the bones may have been chemically
144

altered during fossilization, which would render the isotopic signals
meaningless, and physiologically minded palaeobiologists were far
from convinced about what the result meant: a homeothermic
signal is consistent with the idea that most dinosaurs were
large-bodied mass-homeotherms (Chapter 6) and gives no
conclusive evidence of endo- or ectothermy.
This is clearly an interesting line of inquiry; the results are not yet
conclusive but provide the grounds for future research.

Dinosaur research: the scanning revolution

One of the most anguished dilemmas faced by palaeobiologists is
the desire to explore as much of any new fossil as possible, but at the
same time to minimize the damage caused to the specimen by such
action. The discovery of the potential for X-rays to create images on
photographic ﬁlm of the interior of the body has been of enormous
importance to medical science. The more recent revolution in
medical imaging through the development of CT (computed
tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) techniques
that are linked directly to powerful data-processing computers has
resulted in the ability to create three-dimensional images that allow
researchers to see inside objects such as the human body or other
complex structures that would only normally be possible after
major exploratory surgery.
The potential to use CT scanning to see inside fossils was rapidly
appreciated. One of the leaders in the ﬁeld is Tim Rowe, with his
145

Dinosaur research

The steady improvement in technological resources, as well as their
potential to be used to answer palaeobiological questions, has
manifested in a number of distinct areas in recent years. A few
of these will be examined in the following section; they are not
without their limitations and pitfalls, but in some instances
questions may now be asked that could not have been dreamt
of 10 years ago.

team based at the University of Texas in Austin. He has managed to
set up one of the ﬁnest fossil-dedicated, high-resolution CT
scanning systems and, as we shall see below, has put it to some
extremely interesting uses.

Dinosaurs

Investigating hadrosaurian crests
One obvious use of CT scanning can be demonstrated by referring
to the extravagant range of crests seen on some hadrosaurian
ornithopods. These dinosaurs were very abundant in Late
Cretaceous times and have remarkably similarly shaped bodies;
they only really differ in the shape of their headgear, but the reason
for this difference has been a long-standing puzzle. When the ﬁrst
‘hooded’ dinosaur was described in 1914, it was considered likely
that these were simply interesting decorative features. However, in
1920 it was discovered that these ‘hoods’, or crests, were composed
of thin sheaths of bone that enclosed tubular cavities or chambers of
considerable complexity.
Theories to explain the purpose of these crests abounded from the
1920s onwards. The very earliest claimed that the crest provided an
attachment area for ligaments running from the shoulders to the
neck that supported the large and heavy head. From then on,
ideas ranged from their use as weapons; that they carried highly
developed organs of smell; that they were sexually speciﬁc (males
had crests and females did not); and, the most far-sighted, that the
chambers might have served as resonators, as seen in modern birds.
During the 1940s, there was a preference for aquatic theories: that
they formed an air-lock to prevent water ﬂooding the lungs when
these animals fed on underwater weeds.
Most of the more outlandish suggestions have been abandoned,
either because physically impossible or they do not accord with the
known anatomy. What has emerged is that the crests probably
performed a number of interrelated functions of a mainly social/
sexual type. They probably provided a visual social recognition
146

system for individual species; and, in addition, some elaboration of
the crests undoubtedly served a sexual display purpose. A small
number of hadrosaur crests were sufﬁciently robust to have been
used either in ﬂank or head-butting activities as part of pre-mating
rituals or male–male rivalry competitions. Finally, the chambers
and tubular areas associated with the crests or facial structure are
thought to have functioned as resonators. Again, this presumed
vocal ability (found today in birds and crocodiles) can be linked to
aspects of social behaviour in these dinosaurs.

Soft tissues: hearts of stone?
In the late 1990s, a new partial skeleton of a medium-sized
ornithopod was discovered in Late Cretaceous sandstones in South
Dakota. Part of the skeleton was eroded away, but what remained
was extraordinarily well preserved, with evidence of some of the
soft tissues, such as cartilage, which are normally lost during
fossilization, still visible. During initial preparation of the specimen,
147

Dinosaur research

One of the greatest problems associated with the resonator theory
was gaining direct access to skull material that would allow detailed
reconstruction of the air passages within the crest, without breaking
open prized and carefully excavated specimens. CT techniques
made such internal investigations feasible. For example, some
new material of the very distinctively crested hadrosaur
Parasaurolophus tubicen was collected from Late Cretaceous
sediments in New Mexico. The skull was reasonably complete,
well preserved, and included a long, curved crest. It was CT
scanned along the length of the crest, then the scans were digitally
processed so that the space inside the crest, rather than the crest
itself, could be imaged. The rendered version of the interior cavity
revealed an extraordinary degree of complexity. Several parallel,
narrow tubes looped tightly within the crest, creating the equivalent
of a cluster of trombones! There is now little doubt that the crest
cavities in animals like Parasaurolophus were capable of acting as
resonators as part of their vocal system.

Dinosaurs

a large ferruginous (iron-rich) nodule was discovered in the centre
of the chest. Intrigued by this structure, the researchers obtained
permission to CT scan a major part of the skeleton using a large
veterinary hospital scanner. The results from these scans were
intriguing.
The ferruginous nodule appeared to have distinctive anatomical
features, and there appeared to be associated nearby structures.
The researchers interpreted these as indicating that the heart
and some associated blood vessels had been preserved within the
nodule. The nodule appeared to show two chambers (interpreted
by the researchers as representing the original ventricles of the
heart); a little above these was a curved, tube-like structure that
they interpret as an aorta (one of the main arteries leaving the
heart). On this basis, they went on to suggest that this showed that
dinosaurs of this type had a very bird-like, fully divided heart, which
supported the increasing conviction that dinosaurs were generally
highly active, aerobic animals (see Chapter 6).
As early as 1842, and the extraordinarily prophetic speculations of
Richard Owen, it had been supposed that dinosaurs, crocodiles, and
birds had a relatively efﬁcient four-chambered (i.e. fully divided)
heart. On that basis, this discovery is not so startling. What is
astonishing is the thought that the general shape of the soft tissues
of the heart of this particular dinosaur might have been preserved
through some freak circumstance of fossilization.
Soft tissue preservation is known to occur under some exceptional
conditions in the fossil record; these generally comprise a mixture
of very ﬁne sediments (muds and clays) that are capable of
preserving the impressions of soft tissues. Also, soft tissues, or
rather their chemically replaced remnants, can be preserved by
chemical precipitation, usually in the absence of oxygen. Neither of
these conditions apply to the ornithopod skeleton described above.
The specimen was found in coarse sandstone, and under conditions
that would have been oxygen-rich, so from a simple geochemical
148

perspective, conditions would appear to be very unlikely to preserve
soft tissues of any type.
Not surprisingly, the observations made by the researchers have
been challenged. Ironstone nodules are commonly reported in these
deposits and are frequently found associated with dinosaur bones.
The sedimentary conditions, the chemical environment in which
the structures might have been preserved, and the interpretation of
all the supposedly heart-like features have been contested. At
present, the status of this specimen is therefore uncertain, but
whatever else is claimed, if these features are simply those of an
ironstone nodule, then it is extraordinary that they are so heart-like.

Fake ‘dinobirds’: forensic palaeobiology

The specimen was initially fêted by National Geographic through
public events. However, the specimen soon became dogged by
controversy. It had been bought by a museum based in Utah at a
fossil fair in Tucson, Arizona, even though it evidently came from
China. This is very unusual because the Chinese government
regards all fossils of scientiﬁc value as the property of China.
The specimen came to be regarded with suspicion by the scientiﬁc
community: the front half of the body was almost too bird-like
compared to the theropod-like legs and tail. The surface of
limestone upon which this specimen was preserved was also
149

Dinosaur research

In 1999 an article appeared in the National Geographic magazine
that highlighted the similarities between dinosaurs and birds that
had been revealed by the new discoveries made in Liaoning
Province, China. It brought to light another new and exciting
specimen that was named Archaeoraptor, and was represented by
a nearly complete skeleton that seemed as good an intermediate
‘dinobird’ as one could imagine. The animal had very bird-like
wings and chest bones, yet retained rather theropod-like head, legs,
and the long stiffened tail.

unusual, it consisted of a crazy-paving-like series of small slabs
held together by a lot of ﬁller (see Figure 37). Within a relatively
short period of time, it was declared to be a probable fake –
possibly manufactured to order from assorted spare parts collected
in Liaoning. Amid the general air of concern, the curator of the
Utah museum contacted two palaeontologists who had worked on
these Chinese forms, Philip Currie of the Royal Tyrell Museum,
Alberta, and Xu Xing of Beijing, China; and Tim Rowe was
contacted at Texas to see if he could CT scan and verify the nature
of this fossil.
By an amazing coincidence, Xu, on returning to China, located a
piece of rock from Liaoning containing most of a dromaeosaur
theropod. After studying this specimen, he became convinced that
the tail of this fossil was the matching counterpart to the one he had
recently seen on Archaeoraptor. Returning to Washington, and the
ofﬁce of National Geographic, Xu was able to place his recently
discovered fossil against the Archaeoraptor specimen and
demonstrate that the original Archaeoraptor block was without
doubt a composite consisting of at least two different animals
(the front half being part of a genuine bird, the back half being that
of a dromaeosaur theropod).
Alerted to this, Rowe was able to study the CT scans that he made of
the original Archaeoraptor slab in detail. CT cannot distinguish
genuine from fraudulent fossils. However, the accuracy of the
three-dimensional images of each portion of the slab allowed
precise comparison of each piece of the specimen. It became clear
that a partial bird fossil formed the main part of the slab, to this had
been added the leg bones and feet of a theropod dinosaur. Rowe
and his colleagues were able to show that only one leg bone and foot
had been used. In this instance, the part and counterpart had been
split apart to make a pair of legs and feet! Finally, the tail of the
theropod had been added; and to complete the ‘picture’, additional
pieces of paving and ﬁller were added to create a more visually
pleasing rectangular ensemble.
152

These dramatic revelations have had no effect whatever on the
debate concerning dinosaur-bird relationships. What they do
point to are some unfortunate facts. In China, where poorly paid
labourers have helped to excavate some truly wondrous fossils,
they have clearly developed a good knowledge of anatomy and an
understanding of the sorts of creatures that scientists are looking
for. These workers also realize that there is a thriving market in
such fossils, which will bring them far better ﬁnancial rewards if
they can sell them to dealers outside China.

Dinosaur mechanics: how Allosaurus fed

As with the case of Tyrannosaurus, we know in very general terms
that Allosaurus (Figure 31) was a predatory creature and probably
fed on a range of prey living in Late Jurassic times. Sometimes
tooth marks or scratches may be found on fossil bones and these
can be quite literally lined up against the teeth in the jaws of an
allosaur as a form of ‘proof’ of the guilty party. But what does such
evidence tell us? The answer is: not as much as we might like. We
cannot be sure if the tooth marks were left by a scavenger feeding
off an already dead animal, or whether the animal that left the
tooth marks was the real killer; equally, we cannot tell what style of
predator an allosaur might have been: did it run down its prey
after a long chase, or did it lurk and pounce? Did it have a
devastating bone-crushing bite, or was it more of a cut and
slasher?
153

Dinosaur research

Computed tomography has clearly proved to be a very valuable aid
to palaeobiological investigations because it has this ability to see
inside objects in an almost magical way. Some technologically
innovative ways of using CT imaging have been developed by Emily
Rayﬁeld and colleagues, at the University of Cambridge. Using CT
images, sophisticated computer software, and a great deal of
biological and palaeobiological information, it has proved possible
to investigate how dinosaurs may have functioned as living
creatures.

Dinosaurs

38. Finite-element modelled image of an Allosaurus skull derived from
a CT scan

Rayﬁeld was able to obtain CT scan data created from an
exceptionally well-preserved skull of the Late Jurassic theropod
Allosaurus. High-resolution scans of the skull were used to create
a very detailed three-dimensional image of the entire skull.
However, rather than simply creating a beautiful hologram-like
representation of the skull, Rayﬁeld converted the image data into a
three-dimensional ‘mesh’. The mesh consisted of a series of point
coordinates (rather like the coordinates on a topographic map),
each point was linked to its immediate neighbours by short
‘elements’. This created what in engineering terms is known as
a ﬁnite element map of the entire skull (Figure 38): nothing quite
as complicated as this had ever been attempted before.
The remarkable property of this type of model is that with the
appropriate computer and software it is possible to record, on the
ﬁnite element map, the material properties of the skull bones, for
example the strength of skull bone, of tooth enamel, or of cartilage
154

on the joints between bones. In this way, each ‘element’ can be
prompted to behave as though it were a piece of real skull, and each
element is linked to its neighbours as an integrated unit, as it would
be in life.

Using these sets of data, it was then possible to superimpose these
forces on the ﬁnite element model of the Allosaurus skull and
quite literally ‘test’ how the skull would respond to maximum bite
forces, and how these would be distributed within the skull. The
experiments were intended to probe the construction and shape of
the skull, and the way it responded to stresses associated with
feeding.
What emerged was fascinating. The skull was extraordinarily strong
(despite all the large holes over its surface that might be thought to
have weakened it signiﬁcantly). In fact, the holes proved to be an
important part of the strength of the skull. When the virtual skull
was tested until it began to ‘yield’ (that is to say, it was subjected to
forces that were beginning to fracture its bones), it was found to
be capable of withstanding up to 24 times the force that the jaw
muscles could exert when they were biting as hard as ‘allosaurianly’
possible.
What became obvious from this experimentation was that the
155

Dinosaur research

Having mapped the virtual skull of this dinosaur, it was then
necessary to work out how powerful its jaw muscles were in life.
Using clay, Rayﬁeld was able to quite literally model the jaw muscles
of this dinosaur. Once she had done this, she was able to calculate
from their dimensions – their length, girth, and angle of attachment
to the jaw bones – the amount of force that they could generate.
To ensure that these calculations were as realistic as possible,
two sets of force estimates were generated: one based on the
view that dinosaurs like this one had a rather crocodile-like
(ectotherm) physiology, the other assumed an avian/mammalian
(endotherm) physiology.

Dinosaurs

allosaur skull was hugely over-engineered. Natural selection usually
provides a ‘safety factor’ in the design of most skeletal features: a
sort of trade-off between the amount of energy and materials
needed to build that part of the skeleton and its overall strength
under normal conditions of life. That ‘safety factor’ varies, but is
generally in the range of 2–5 times the forces normally experienced
during normal life activities. To have the skull of Allosaurus built
with a ‘safety factor’ of 24 seemed ludicrous. Re-examination of
the skull, and a rethink about its potential methods of feeding, led
to the following realization: the lower jaw was actually quite ‘weak’
in the way it was constructed, so the animal probably did have a
genuinely weak bite, compared to its overall skull strength. This
suggested that the skull was constructed to withstand very large
forces (in excess of 5 tonnes) for other reasons. The most obvious
was that the skull may have been used as the principal attack
weapon – as a chopper. These animals may well have lunged at their
prey with the jaws opened very wide, and then slammed their head
downward against their prey in a devastating, slashing blow. With
the weight of the body behind this movement, and the resistance of
the prey animal, the skull would need to be capable of withstanding
short-term, but extremely high, loads.
Once the prey had been subdued following the ﬁrst attack, the jaws
could then be used to bite off pieces of ﬂesh in the conventional way,
but this might reasonably have been aided by using the legs and
body to assist with tugs at resistant pieces of meat, again loading the
skull quite highly through forces generated by the neck, back, and
leg muscles.
In this particular analysis, it has been possible to gain an idea of
how feeding may have been achieved in allosaurs in ways that until
a few years ago would have been unimaginable. Yet again, the
interplay between new technologies and different branches of
science (in this instance engineering design) can be used to probe
palaeobiological problems and generate new and interesting
observations.
156

Ancient biomolecules and tissues
I cannot ﬁnish this chapter without mentioning the Jurassic Park
scenario: discovering dinosaur DNA, using modern biotechnology
to reconstitute that DNA, and using this to bring the dinosaur
back to life.

All reports of dino-DNA to date have proved to be records of
contaminants. In fact the only reliable fossil DNA that has been
identiﬁed is far more recent, and even these discoveries have
been made possible because of unusual preservational conditions.
For example, brown bear fossils whose remains are dated back to
about 60,000 years have yielded short strings of mitochondrial
DNA – but these fossils had been frozen in permafrost since the
animals died, providing the best chance of reducing the rate of
degradation of these molecules. Dinosaur remains are of course
1,000 times more ancient than those of arctic brown bears.
Although it might be possible to identify some dinosaur-like genes
in the DNA of living birds, regenerating a dinosaur is beyond the
bounds of science.
157

Dinosaur research

There have been sporadic reports of ﬁnding fragments of dinosaur
DNA in the scientiﬁc literature over the past decade, and then using
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) biotechnology to amplify the
fragments so that they can be studied more easily. Unfortunately,
for those who wish to believe in the Hollywood-style scenario,
absolutely none of these reports have been veriﬁed, and in truth it is
exceedingly unlikely that any genuine dinosaur DNA will ever be
isolated from dinosaur bone. It is simply the case that DNA is a long
and complex biomolecule which degrades over time in the absence
of the metabolic machinery that will maintain and repair it, as
occurs in living cells. The chances of any such material surviving
unaltered for over 65 million years while it is buried in the ground
(and subject there to all the contamination risks presented by
micro-organisms and other biological and chemical sources, and
ground water) are effectively zero.

Dinosaurs

One ﬁnal, but extremely interesting, set of observations concerns
the analysis of the appearance and chemical composition of the
interior of some tyrannosaur bones from Montana. Mary Schweitzer
and colleagues from North Carolina State University were given
access to some remarkably well preserved T. rex bones collected by
Jack Horner (the real-life model for ‘Dr Alan Grant’ in the ﬁlm
Jurassic Park). Detailed examination of the skeletal remains
suggested that there had been minimal alteration of the internal
structure of the long bones; indeed, so unaltered were they that the
individual bones of the tyrannosaur had a density that was consistent
with that of modern bones that had simply been left to dry.
Schweitzer was looking for ancient biomolecules, or at least the
remnant chemical signals that they might have left behind. Having
extracted material from the interior of the bones, this was powdered
and subjected to a broad range of physical, chemical, and biological
analyses. The idea behind this approach was not only to have the
best chance of ‘catching’ some trace, but also to have a range of
semi-independent support for the signal, if it emerged. The burden
really is upon the researcher to ﬁnd some positive proof of the
presence of such biomolecules; the time elapsed since death and
burial, and the overwhelming probability that any remnant of such
molecules has been completely destroyed or ﬂushed away, seem to
be overwhelming. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin
resonance revealed the presence of molecular residues resembling
haemoglobin (the primary chemical constituent of red blood cells);
spectroscopic analysis and HPLC (high performance liquid
chromatography) generated data that was also consistent with the
presence of remnants of the haeme structure. Finally, the dinosaur
bone tissues were ﬂushed with solvents to extract any remaining
protein fragments; this extract was then injected into laboratory
rats to see if it would raise an immune response – and it did! The
antiserum created by the rats reacted positively with puriﬁed avian
and mammalian haemoglobins. From this set of analyses, it seems
very probable that chemical remnants of dinosaurian haemoglobin
compounds were preserved in these T. rex tissues.
158

Even more tantalizingly, when thin sections of portions of bone
were examined microscopically, small, rounded microstructures
could be identiﬁed in the vascular channels (blood vessels) within
the bone. These microstructures were analysed and found to be
notably iron-rich compared to the surrounding tissues (iron being
a principal constituent of the haeme molecule). Also the size and
general appearance was remarkably reminiscent of avian nucleated
blood cells. Although these structures are not actual blood cells,
they certainly seem to be the chemically altered ‘ghosts’ of the
originals. Quite how these structures have survived in this state
for 65 Ma is a considerable puzzle.

Although these results have been treated with considerable
scepticism by the research community at large – and rightly so, for
the reasons elaborated above – nevertheless, the range of scientiﬁc
methodologies employed to support their conclusions, and the
exemplary caution with which these observations were announced,
represent a model of clarity and application of scientiﬁc
methodologies in this ﬁeld of palaeobiology.

159

Dinosaur research

Schweitzer and her co-workers have also been able to identify
(using immunological techniques similar to the one mentioned
above) biomolecular remnants of the ‘tough’ proteins known as
collagen (a major constituent of natural bone, as well as ligaments
and tendons) and keratin (the material that forms scales, feathers,
hair, and claws).

Chapter 8
The future of research
on the past

K-T extinctions: the end of dinosaurs?
Since the early decades of the 19th century, it had been known that
different groups of organisms dominate different periods of Earth
history. One of the more notable groups was the dinosaurs, and
there was a steady reinforcement from palaeontological surveys of
the idea that none were to be found in rocks younger than the end of
the Cretaceous period (approximately 65 Ma). In fact, it came to be
recognized that the very end of the Cretaceous Period, leading into
the Tertiary Period (now universally referred to as the K-T
boundary) marked a major time of change. Many species became
extinct and were replaced in the Early Tertiary by a diversity of new
forms: the K-T boundary therefore seemed to represent a major
punctuation in life and consequently a mass-extinction event. The
types of species that became extinct at this time included the fabled
dinosaurs on land, of which there were many different varieties by
Late Cretaceous times; a multiplicity of sea creatures, ranging from
giant marine reptiles (mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs), to
the hugely abundant ammonites, as well as a great range of chalky
planktonic organisms; while in the air the ﬂying reptiles
(pterosaurs) and enantiornithine birds disappeared forever.
Clearly it was necessary to try to understand what might have
caused such a dramatic loss of life. The ﬂip side of this general
160

question was just as important: why did some creatures survive?
After all, modern birds survived, so did mammals, and so did lizards
and snakes, crocodiles and tortoises, ﬁsh and a whole host of other
sea creatures. Was it just luck? Up until 1980, most of the theories
that had been put forward to explain the K-T extinctions and
survivals ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.

In 1980, this ﬁeld of investigation was completely revolutionized
by, of all people, an astronomer, Luis Alvarez. His son Walter, a
palaeobiologist, had been studying changes in plankton diversity at
the K-T boundary. It seemed logical to assume that the interval
between the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary might simply
represent a longish period of ‘missing’ time – a genuine gap in
the continuity of the fossil record. To assist Walter in his studies
concerning the changes in planktonic communities at this critical
time in Earth history, Luis suggested that he could measure the
amount of cosmic dust that was accumulating in boundary
sediments in order to be able to provide an estimate of the extent
161

The future of research on the past

One of the more persistent of the pre-1980 theories revolved around
detailed studies of the ecological make-up of the time zones closest
to the K-T boundary. The consensus suggested that there was a shift
to progressively more seasonal/variable climatic conditions at the
end of the Cretaceous Period. This was mirrored in the decline of
those animals and plants less able to cope with more stressful
climatic conditions. This was linked, rather inconclusively, to
tectonic changes towards the close of the Cretaceous Period; these
included marked sea-level rises and greatly increased continental
provinciality. The general impression was that the world was slowly
changing in character, and this eventually culminated in a dramatic
faunal and ﬂoral turnover. Clearly such explanations require a
longer timescale for the extinction event to take place, but the
Achilles heel was that this did not adequately account for the
simultaneous changes seen in marine communities. In the absence
of better-quality data, arguments waxed and waned with no obvious
resolution.

Dinosaurs

of this presumed geological gap. Their results shocked the
palaeontological and geological world. They found that the
boundary layer, which was represented by a thin band of clay,
contained enormous quantities of cosmic debris that could only be
explained by the impact and subsequent vaporization of a gigantic
meteorite. They calculated that this meteorite would have needed to
be at least 10 kilometres in diameter. Considering the effect of the
impact of such a giant meteorite, they further proposed that the
huge debris cloud generated (containing water vapour and dust
particles) after the impact would have shrouded the Earth
completely for a signiﬁcant period of time, perhaps several
months or even a year or two. Shrouding the Earth in this way
would have shut down photosynthesis of land plants and planktonic
organisms, and triggered the simultaneous collapse of terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems. At a stroke, the Alvarezes and their
colleagues seemed to have found a unifying explanation for
the K-T event.
As with all good theories, the impact hypothesis generated an
impressive volume of research. Throughout the 1980s, more and
more teams of researchers were able to identify cosmic debris and
violent impact-related signals in K-T boundary sediments from
the four corners of the globe. By the late 1980s, the attention of a
number of workers was drawn to the Caribbean area. Reports
showed that on some of the Caribbean islands, such as Haiti,
deposits of sediments at the K-T boundary not only showed the
impact signal, but immediately above this an enormous thickness
of breccia (broken masses of rock that had been thrown together).
This, as well as the greater thicknesses of the meteorite debris
layer and its chemical signature, prompted the suggestion that
the meteorite had impacted somewhere in the shallow sea in this
area. In 1991, the announcement was made that researchers had
identiﬁed a large subterranean meteorite impact crater, which they
called Chicxulub, on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The crater
itself had been covered by 65 million years of sediment, and had
only been visualized by studying seismic echoes of the Earth’s crust
162

(rather like the principle of underground radar). The crater
appeared to be approximately 200 kilometres across and coincided
with the K-T boundary layer, so Alvarez’s theory was vindicated in a
most remarkable way.

163

The future of research on the past

From the early 1990s onwards, study of the K-T event shifted
away from the causes, which then seemed to have been established,
to attempting to link the extinctions at this time to a single
catastrophic event. The parallels to the nuclear winter debate are
fairly clear. Advances in computer modelling, combined with
knowledge of the likely chemical composition of the ‘target’ rocks
(shallow sea deposits) and their behaviour under high-pressure
shock, have shed light on the early phases of the impact and its
environmental effects. At Yucatán, the meteorite would have
impacted on a sea ﬂoor that was naturally rich in water, carbonate,
and sulphate; this would have propelled as much as 200 gigatons
each of sulphur dioxide and water vapour into the stratosphere.
Impact models based on the geometry of the crater itself suggest
that the impact was oblique and from the south-east. This trajectory
would have concentrated the expelled gases towards North
America. The fossil record certainly suggests that ﬂoral extinctions
were particularly severe in this area, but more work elsewhere is
needed before this pattern can be veriﬁed. Alvarez and others’ work
on the effects of the impact suggested that dust and clouds would
have plunged the world into a freezing blackout. However,
computer modelling of atmospheric conditions now suggests that
within a few months light levels and temperatures would have
begun to rebound because of the thermal inertia of the oceans, and
the steady fall-out of particulate matter from the atmosphere.
Unfortunately, however, things would have become no better for
some considerable time because the sulphur dioxide and water in
the atmosphere would have combined to produce sulphuric acid
aerosols, and these would have severely reduced the amount of
sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface for between 5 and 10 years.
These aerosols would have had the combined effects of cooling the
Earth to near freezing and drenching the surface in acid rain.

Clearly these estimates are based only on computer models,
which may be subject to error. However, even if only partly true,
the general scope of the combination of environmental effects
following the impact would have been genuinely devastating,
and may well account for many aspects of the terrestrial and
marine extinctions that mark the end of the Cretaceous Period.
In a sense, the wonder is that anything survived these apocalyptic
conditions at all.

Dinosaurs

Perturbations
While much of the work in recent years has focused on explaining
the environmental effects of a large meteorite on global ecosystems,
work is still continuing at the Chicxulub site. A major borehole has
now been sunk into the crater to a depth of 1.5 kilometres in order
that detailed examination of the impact zone can take place. What
is beginning to emerge is slightly disturbing to the general pattern
that has been explained above. One set of interpretations of the
core data indicates that the impact crater may have been made as
many as 300,000 years before the K-T boundary. The interval is
represented by 0.5 metres of sediment. This evidence has been used
to propose that the end Cretaceous event was not focused on a
single large meteorite impact, but several large impacts that
occurred right up to the K-T boundary – the cumulative effect of
which may have caused the pattern of extinctions.
Clearly these new ﬁndings indicate that more research and more
debate will undoubtedly take place in years to come. Not least
among these are the data concerning massive volcanic activity that
coincided with the end Cretaceous events. Parts of India known as
the Deccan represent a gigantic series of ﬂood-basalts that have
been estimated as representing millions of cubic kilometres. Quite
what the environmental impact of such enormous volcanic
outpourings was, and whether this was in any way linked to the
meteorite impact on the other side of the world, is still to be
established.
164

Mass extinctions are fascinating punctuation marks in the
history of life on Earth – nailing down exactly what caused
them is, not surprisingly, very difﬁcult.

Dinosaur research now and in the near future

To take advantage of many of these opportunities it is important
to have at hand people who share a number of characteristics.
Above all, they need to have an abiding interest in the history of life
on Earth and naturally inquisitive temperaments. They also need
some training in a surprisingly wide range of areas. While there is
still an importance in the individual scientist working and thinking
creatively in some degree of isolation, it is increasingly the case that
multidisciplinary teams are needed to bring a wider range of skills
to bear on each problem, or each new discovery, in order to tease
out the information that will move the science a little further
forward.

165

The future of research on the past

It should be clear by now that a subject such as palaeobiology –
certainly as it is currently being applied to fascinating creatures
such as dinosaurs – has a decided unpredictability about it.
Many research programmes in palaeobiology can be planned,
and indeed have an intellectually satisfying structure to them,
in order to explore speciﬁc issues or problems; this is normal
for all the sciences. However, serendipity also plays a signiﬁcant
role: it can lead research in unexpected directions that could not
have been anticipated at the outset. It can also be inﬂuenced
strongly by spectacular new discoveries – nobody in the early
1990s would have been able to predict the amazing ‘dinobird’
ﬁnds that were made in China in 1996 and continue to the
present day; technological advances in the physical and biological
sciences also play an increasingly important part in research,
allowing us to study fossils in ways that were, again, unimaginable
just a few years ago.

And ﬁnally . . .

Dinosaurs

My message is a relatively simple one. We, as a human race, could
simply chose to ignore the history of life on Earth, as can be
interpreted, in part at least, through the study of fossils. There are
indeed many who adhere to such thoughts. Fortunately, I would say,
a few of us do not. The pageant of life has been played out across the
past 3,600 million years – a staggeringly long period of time. We as
humans currently dominate most ecosystems, either directly or
indirectly, but we have only risen to this position over the past
10,000 years of life on Earth. Before the human species, a wide
range of organisms held sway. The dinosaurs were one such group
and they, in a sense, acted as unwitting custodians of the Earth they
inhabited. Palaeobiology allows us to trace parts of that
custodianship.
The deeper question is: can we learn from past experiences and
use them to help us to preserve an inhabitable Earth for other
species to inherit when we are ﬁnally gone? This is an awesome
responsibility given the current global threats posed by an
exponential population increase, climatic change, and the threat
posed by nuclear power. We are the ﬁrst species ever to exist on this
planet that has been able to appreciate that the Earth is not just
‘here and now’ but has a deep history. I hope sincerely that we will
not also be the last. The one thing that we can be sure of, after
studying the waxing and waning of species throughout the
immensity of the fossil record, is that the human species will not
endure for ever.
From our origins as Homo sapiens approximately 500,000 years
ago, our species might last a further 1 million years, or perhaps even
5 million years if we are extraordinarily successful (or lucky), but we
will eventually go the way of the dinosaurs: that much at least is
written in the rocks.
