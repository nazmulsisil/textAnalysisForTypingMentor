Preface

For an apparently small organization dealing with abstruse trade
matters in Geneva, the World Trade Organization (WTO) arouses
surprising levels of popular interest, emotions, and high drama. At
the last high-level meeting of the WTO at Cancun in 2003, nongovernmental organizations staged massive anti-WTO demonstrations,
participating countries threatened to walk out of the conference, and a
South Korean farmer committed suicide to show just what he thought of
the WTO’s rules on agriculture. Nor was Cancun unusual in any way;
most ministerial-level meetings of the organization have come to be
associated with impassioned protests and angry mobs.
There is no dearth of books and research papers that offer detailed
economic and legal explanations and interpretations of the agreements
of the WTO. There are also many papers written by civil society
activists – some less judiciously researched than others – for the
purposes of policy advocacy. But analyses that focus on the politics of
the WTO are rare to ﬁnd. This book seeks to ﬁll this gap in the
literature, and tries to get to the heart of the WTO as an international
organization and the politics that underlie its origins, functioning, and
evolution.
Two features of this book are worth highlighting. First, my central
approach to the study of the WTO as an international institution is
through the lens of negotiation process. By analysing the constant

interplay between existing structures and underlying processes, I
present an account of not only the initial bargain that led to the creation
of the WTO but also how the organization has evolved in terms of its
membership, mandate, and everyday functioning. Contingency,
path dependence, and negotiation process go a long way in determining
how the WTO has got to the point it has, rather than rational design of
the institution. Second, developing countries form an integral part of
the story presented here. This attention to developing countries is not
one that I had initially intended. But all my research ﬁndings
continuously pointed in a direction that has been largely neglected: the
link between power asymmetries and international institutions. I found
that power differences between developed and developing countries
played a crucial role in the making and shaping of the WTO, and that
the institution itself affects power discrepancies in many different ways.
As a result, power, marginalization, discontent, and development are
recurring themes in this book.
I have also chosen to engage directly with the many public debates on
the WTO. The organization presents a fascinating mix of contradictions.
It is, by far, the smallest and youngest of the three international
economic organizations (the other two being the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank). But it makes rules that often
encroach into areas that have traditionally lain within the domestic
jurisdictions of states, and with which all 147 members must comply. It
is true that many of the WTO’s activities lie in the obscure and esoteric
realms of trade policy. But the deep and far-reaching impact of its rules
on the everyday lives of peoples means that it is not an institution of
interest to economists alone. On paper, the WTO has the most
democratic procedures of the three economic organizations; in practice,
the WTO has come under immense criticism for its almost ‘English club
atmosphere’ and exclusionary meetings. The WTO is simultaneously
accused, in broadsheets and elsewhere, of not doing enough and of
doing too much: some argue that the WTO should cover issues of
labour, gender, and development, while others view its already
expansionist tendencies with alarm. Contradictory proposals for
institutional reform abound. The WTO is adored by some, and viliﬁed

by many. By presenting an account and explanation of the evolution,
purpose, and political workings of the WTO, it is hoped that this book
will help the reader to better navigate the murky waters of international
trade politics.

Acknowledgements

While conducting research for this book, I have relied extensively
on interviews with trade negotiators and international bureaucrats
from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
and the World Trade Organization. They are too numerous to name
here, and many sought anonymity for obvious reasons. I am
extremely grateful to them for so generously sharing their
experiences and concerns with me.
I owe a special debt of gratitude to John Odell and Diana Tussie for
many long and inspiring conversations about trade politics over the
years. Their guidance has had a long-lasting and invaluable impact
on my research, and every discussion with them has been as
enjoyable as it has been enlightening and memorable.
I am equally indebted to Andrew Hurrell and Desmond King for
many stimulating questions and ideas that we explored together in
the pleasant environs of Nufﬁeld College; without their intellectual
support and encouragement, this project might not have come
through.
Colleagues and friends contributed to the book in crucial ways,
reading and commenting on the manuscript (or parts thereof ),
engaging in fruitful exchanges on the subject, and providing moral
support. In particular, I would like to thank Ewan Harrison,

Konrad Banaszek, Theo Farrell, Steve McGuire, and Mette-Eilstrup
Sangiovanni.
Alan Renwick gave the book a running start and then stood by me
throughout, providing detailed and constructive suggestions on the
manuscript.
I am thankful to all the institutions that supported this project. The
Nufﬁeld Foundation funded my research leave, and I am especially
grateful to the trustees and Louie Burghes for their constant
interest and support. Library facilities at the Bodleian were critical
in the early stages of the project, as was my research afﬁliation with
the Centre for International Studies, University of Oxford. Excellent
infrastructure and supportive colleagues at the Centre for
International Studies in Cambridge and at Newnham College
provided the ideal milieu for its completion. Here, a special note of
thanks is extended to Chris Hill, Onora O’Neill, and Terri Apter.
The editor of the series, Marsha Filion, who carefully and patiently
shepherded the project from the beginning to its completion,
deserves my warmest appreciation. I thank her and her colleagues
at Oxford University Press, particularly James Thompson, who
worked long and hard and with great efﬁciency to keep to the tight
schedule. The original proposal and manuscript beneﬁted from the
comments of three anonymous referees.
For their friendship and loyalty, I would like to thank my ‘English
parents’ Linda and Moreton Moore, and also David Armstrong,
Maggie Armstrong, Caroline Lombardo, John Love, Rachel Muers,
Mathan Satchithananthan, and Ed Tarte.
My greatest debt is to my parents, Aruna and Anant Narlikar.
Anant, who normally studies low-temperature physics, was
equally adept in providing insightful comments about the high
temperatures that have surrounded trade politics. Aruna, despite
her busy schedule, found time to share new ideas, raise incisive

questions, read several drafts and re-drafts, and provide comments
that helped me immensely in writing this book. This book could not
have been written without their critical comments and constant
encouragement.
The memory of my friend Batasha has been a constant source of
inspiration.
The responsibility for any errors in the book lies with the author
alone.

Chapter 1
Who needs an international
trade organization?

For a relatively youthful organization concerned with esoteric trade
affairs, the WTO has already aroused unprecedented fury and
passion. The extent to which controversies about the WTO have
entered into the public domain was most graphically illustrated in
the popular demonstrations at the Seattle meeting in 1999 (see
Figure 1).
At the Cancun meeting in 2003, these passions showed little sign of
abating. Given the anger the WTO has generated, in this chapter we

ask the question: who needs an international trade organization
anyway?

World Trade Organization

Is there a case for an international trade
organization?
To make a case for or against an international trade organization,
we need to identify the role that such an institution might be
expected to play in the global economic system. The Agreement
establishing the WTO commits its member states to a variety of
noble objectives: improved standards of living, full employment,
expanded production of and trade in goods and services,
sustainable development, and an enhanced share of developing
countries in world trade. The Agreement further commits its
members to contribute to these objectives ‘by entering into
reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the
substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade and to the
elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade
relations’. The WTO as an institution is clearly committed to trade
liberalization. It is worth emphasizing that this commitment is not
an end in itself, but is seen as a means to achieving the broader
social ends mentioned above.
Barring a few qualiﬁcations, economists view the commitment to
trade liberalization as a welfare-maximizing pursuit. Economic
theory since the middle of the 18th century has presented the
advantages in lowering tariffs for most parties in most situations.
The gains from trade derive from specialization on the basis of
comparative advantage. Put very simply, if each country were to
produce that which it is best at producing (in comparison to all the
other products that it could still produce but with lesser efﬁciency),
there would be a bigger output of each of these efﬁciently produced
products in each country. The countries could then trade among
themselves, with each exporting the good or service in which it has
the comparative advantage and importing the good or service in
which it has a comparative disadvantage. Such an exchange would
2

beneﬁt all the countries involved. In fact, as per classical trade
theory, the gains from trade accrue to any country that lowers trade
barriers irrespective of what other countries do, thereby suggesting
that the rational actor may be expected to pursue unilateral trade
liberalization. Indeed, as Paul Krugman puts it: ‘If economists
ruled the world, there would be no need for a World Trade
Organization.’

There are several reasons – economic and political – why states act
in ways that turn out to be detrimental to their self-interest. The
ﬁrst insight on why some states may choose the path of
protectionism, despite the beneﬁts of trade liberalization, comes
directly from economic theory and the notion of the ‘optimal tariff’.
While it is unambiguously in the interest of the small country to
liberalize trade, economic theory tells us that the situation is
different for large countries. The optimal tariff argument tells us
that it may be in the interest of a large country to restrict trade at a
3

Who needs an international trade organization?

A quick peek into the real world suggests that despite the promise
of free trade, countries have historically been reluctant to reduce
trade barriers and quick to raise them. A frequently cited example
of this policy inclination, and its disastrous consequences, is that of
the United States and other countries in the years of the Great
Depression. Following the stock market crash of 1929, the US
Congress adopted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 that raised
US tariffs to an average of nearly 60%. Most of the major trade
partners of the US retaliated by raising similar tariff barriers and
engaging in a competitive devaluation of their currencies. Prices fell
further, tariff barriers went up, and a race to the bottom ensued that
worsened the Great Depression. The cataclysmic effects of these
beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the 1930s left a long-lasting
impression on the minds of policy-makers in the post-war years. It
was recognized that cooperation among states is difﬁcult to
organize or sustain without the presence of international
institutions, even if states are aware that non-cooperation will
adversely affect all parties.

World Trade Organization

certain ‘optimal’ level, as it will be able to change the terms of trade
in its favour by so doing. Should the large state intervene
unilaterally and solely in its foreign trade relations, it would incur
gains at the cost of other producers and consumers abroad. Such
restrictions would hence translate into reduced welfare for the
world as a whole, though they would work to the advantage of the
large state concerned. However, as the example of the SmootHawley tariffs in the US showed, other states are unlikely to accept
such restrictions passively and would impose similar, retaliatory
restrictions. The result would be a downward spiral in the welfare of
all states caught in the tariff war. Economists Bernard Hoekman
and Michel Kostecki provide a succinct interpretation of this
problem in terms of the classic Prisoners’ Dilemma game: ‘it is in
each country’s interest to impose restrictions, but the result of such
individually rational policies is inefﬁcient.’
What would the impact of such a tariff war among large states be
on smaller countries? The African saying ‘When two elephants
ﬁght, it is the grass that gets trampled’ applies well in this context.
High tariffs, targeted speciﬁcally between the US and the EU, for
instance, might at ﬁrst glance imply that small countries ﬁnd these
vast markets opened up to them without the competition of the
giants. But the race to reach these large markets would draw the
small countries too into a war of their own, involving
unsustainable price-cutting and an expensive race to the bottom.
As a result, a tariff war between the larger states would result in
reduced world welfare and adversely affect both large and small
countries.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma problem in international trade is well
known, and governments recognize the costs of retaliation that they
risk if any one of them imposes trade restrictions. But there is still
no guarantee that one renegade and powerful state will not resort to
this individually rational but collectively sub-optimal outcome,
thereby dragging all the other states into a chain reaction of
retaliations. Equally plausible is the danger that one (or more) state
4

Besides facilitating international cooperation, institutionalized
rules of reciprocity, monitoring. and enforcement in a multilateral
trade organization also offer some important political advantages to
member governments. Trade liberalization may improve overall
national welfare, but it also entails disruptive distributive
consequences within societies by producing losers and gainers.
Political economists have pointed out that the greatest losses from
liberalization accrue to import-competing industries, whereas the
biggest gains accrue to consumers. One might expect the consumer
interests gaining from the liberalization to balance out against the
protectionist producer interests that stand to lose. But the problem
with such a distribution is that producer interests tend to be far
more concentrated, organized, and vocal than consumer interests.
Multilateral liberalization opens up several foreign markets and
thereby ensures that domestic ﬁrms seeking foreign market access
will balance out against the protectionist ﬁrms. The process of trade
5

may withdraw from its commitments to trade liberalization,
imposing unexpected and heavy costs on its trading partners. The
plausibility of these risks often acts as a deterrent for most states
from committing to trade liberalization. The best way of preventing
such a mutually destructive situation from emerging is by ensuring
that countries commit to trade liberalization on a reciprocal basis.
Reciprocal trade liberalization increases the gains from trade by
further expanding the output to be traded. But more importantly, if
countries have some mechanism of binding themselves and each
other to commitments on tariff reductions, the risk of a retaliatory
trade war (akin to the 1930s trade war) is reduced. Herein lies the
logic of multilateral trade liberalization. An international trade
organization establishes rules of reciprocity on a generalized basis
across three or more countries, and thereby multilateralizes
reciprocity. By monitoring and enforcing these rules, the
multilateral trade organization guards against cheating and
defection by member countries. Indeed, the raison d’être for most
international organizations across most issue-areas lies in a similar
logic.

World Trade Organization

liberalization becomes not only economically beneﬁcial but also
politically feasible.
Adherence to the rules of an international trade organization also
serves an important domestic imperative for governments by
allowing them to resist protectionist demands. When faced with
such pressures, particularly when the going gets tough and interest
groups are demanding a reversal of liberal policies, governments
can claim that their hands are tied by appealing to the international
codes of conduct of the organization with which they are bound.
The fact that the particular government had taken on its
liberalization programme within the auspices of a multilateral trade
organization means that reneging on those commitments will have
punitive consequences of various types. Depending on the nature of
the organization and its enforcement mechanism, these
consequences could range from international disapproval, to
compensating all the members for the costs they incur as a result of
the particular country’s action, to direct retaliation. Indeed,
governments frequently appeal to such rationales to justify
unpopular actions that are supposed to have longer-term beneﬁts
(and not simply in trade matters) by claiming that their
international commitments bind them to act thus. It is not
surprising that across developing countries, many of the
programmes of economic reform and restructuring in the late
1980s to early 1990s, particularly those involving some difﬁcult
distributive consequences, were taken on in the shadow of the
international economic organizations.
All the beneﬁts of having an international trade organization noted
so far apply to countries irrespective of their economic size and
bargaining power. But developing countries have an additional set
of stakes in the existence of such an organization (see box). It is now
a generally accepted argument in international relations theory,
ﬁrst put forth by Stephen Krasner in 1985, that weak states seek
rules-based, authoritative international regimes. Such regimes
introduce a greater measure of certainty in international relations
6

Deﬁning developing countries
For many years now, academics have been engaged in a
debate on the concept of the developing world. Many have
argued that the concept has been rendered obsolete due to
the increasing differentiation among developing countries.
Indeed, the vulnerabilities of the small economies of the
Caribbean, with their proximity to the US, are very different
from the threats faced by the smaller economies of Africa or
the Paciﬁc, let alone their divergence from the emerging
powers of the developing world such as Brazil, China,
and India. However, these differences notwithstanding,
7

and thereby help mitigate a rampant abuse of power by stronger
states. This certainty is a valuable resource for developing countries,
which have limited resources and can put them to better use if the
rules of the game are established. The regulation of international
trade through a multilateral trade organization further provides
developing countries one of the few safeguards that they have
against arbitrary arm-twisting by the powerful. Unlike in a bilateral
context, developed countries cannot easily renege on their
commitments in a multilateral institution; if they do so, they must
face the penalties that follow from breaking international rules.
And ﬁnally, the existence of a multilateral trade organization
provides developing countries with an important institutional
context within which they can build coalitions and thereby improve
their bargaining position. As a result, developing countries tend to
prefer more deﬁned rules, and greater enforcement capacity in the
institution administering those rules (with the caveat, of course,
that much depends on the nature of the rules and who actually
administers them). A multilateral trade organization can present
the most rigorous codiﬁcation of rules. It may be safe to say that,
especially if a country is small and weak, its international economic
life without an international trade organization would be ‘nasty,
brutish, and short’.

World Trade Organization

developing countries share two sets of characteristics –
marginalization or peripherality, and ‘Third World
schizophrenia’.
Marginalization, or peripherality, refers to the inability of
developing countries to shape international institutions to
their advantage or emerge as full players in the international
system. Due to domestic and international weaknesses, often
derived from their colonial past, these countries ﬁnd themselves in the position of rule-takers rather than agendasetters. This is as true of countries like Brazil and India,
which have traditionally been invited to the negotiating table
but nonetheless have repeatedly complained that their concerns are disregarded, as it is of the smaller developing countries that have found it difﬁcult to get a place in key decisionmaking meetings.
Related to marginalization is the phenomenon that
Mohammed Ayoob succinctly terms ‘Third World schizophrenia’. As the intruder majority in a system of states that
was not built to suit their advantage, developing countries
have sought to bring about systemic change. But as a result of
their vulnerabilities, they also have an incentive to preserve
the existing system of rules that provides legitimacy to their
statehood and ensures their very survival.
The shared features of marginalization and schizophrenia
impair the bargaining skill and resolve of developing countries. These characteristics are not conﬁned to the smallest
and the poorest developing countries; rich developing countries (such as the Southeast Asian economies even prior to
the Asian ﬁnancial crisis) and large developing countries
with regional clout (such as Brazil and India) share the trait
of limited bargaining power. The group of countries sharing
these features are often collectively referred to as the South
(in contrast to the developed countries, the North), the Third
World, or the developing world.
8

Note that within the developing world is a sub-group of countries, referred to as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
Unlike the term ‘developing country’, which is intersubjectively deﬁned, LDCs are countries identiﬁed by the UN
that meet all three criteria of low income (currently marked
at below $750 gross domestic product per capita), human
resource weakness, and economic vulnerability. In 2003,
Senegal was added to the list of LDCs, making a total of 50
countries.

Modelling a multilateral trade organization:
the ITO and the GATT
While the previous section has argued strongly in favour of a
multilateral trade organization, this does not amount to a defence of
the World Trade Organization. An international organization can
take a variety of shapes, and may be guided by a spectrum of rules
9

Who needs an international trade organization?

Belonging to the developing world is at least as much a product of self-designation by the countries concerned and recognition by other members of the group, as it is of any objective criteria applied by outsiders. In keeping with this, most
international organizations leave the task of claiming developing country status to the countries themselves. Often, this
is a matter of negotiation between the particular country and
other countries that will be affected by the decision. For
instance, this proved to be a bone of contention in China’s
negotiations for accession to the WTO. China claimed developing country status, which would allow it to use special provisions reserved for developing countries, such as longer
transition periods in the implementation of certain rules.
Developed countries baulked at the idea. A compromise was
ﬁnally arrived at, but only after long and protracted
negotiation.

that have far-reaching implications for international power and
wealth distributions. In this section, we brieﬂy examine two models
of a multilateral trade organization that were formulated by
international negotiators: one that never actually materialized and
one that did.

World Trade Organization

The International Trade Organization (ITO)
Following the end of the Second World War, international leaders
were anxious to build safeguards and institutions into the
international system that would protect the world from the
recurrence of such disastrous events. The US took the lead in
advancing the view that free trade provided an important
mechanism for achieving world peace. US Secretary of State,
Cordell Hull, was an eminent and inﬂuential exponent of this
view:
I have never faltered, and I will never falter, in my belief that
enduring peace and the welfare of nations are indissolubly
connected with friendliness, fairness, equality and the maximum
practicable degree of freedom in international trade.
Cordell Hull, Economic Barriers to Peace (New York:
Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 1937, p. 14)

The Allies, particularly the US and Britain, began discussions about
the reconstruction of the world economic order even before the war
effort was over. In 1944, at the Bretton Woods conference, the US
and Britain signed an agreement that provided the blueprint for the
post-war economy. Three pillars were envisaged for the purpose of
maintaining international economic cooperation: the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (or the World Bank), and the International Trade
Organization (ITO). Following the bilateral trade negotiations
between the US and Britain, successive multilateral conferences
were held between 1946 and 1948. The outcome of this process was
the Havana Charter, the draft agreement for the creation of the
10

ITO, which was signed by 53 of the 56 countries participating in the
conference.
Despite this promising multilateral commitment, the ITO never
came into existence. The agreement required ratiﬁcation in the US
Congress before it could be implemented, and no other country was
willing to commit to the rules of an ITO without the US aboard. But
US ratiﬁcation proved to be problematic, despite its leading role in
the genesis and evolution of the idea of the ITO. By 1948, the
context that had initially led to the idea of the ITO had changed
substantially. Domestically in the US, it began to appear extremely
unlikely that the Republican Congress of 1948 would ratify the
Charter despite the support that the Havana process had enjoyed
from the Democratic presidency. International imperatives further
demanded that the attention of the Congress be devoted to more
immediate and pressing matters. Finally, in 1950, President
Truman announced that he would not be submitting the Charter

Conference at Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods in 1944,

to the Congress for ratiﬁcation. Given the preponderance of the
US in the post-war economy, other countries decided that an ITO
without the participation of the US would be meaningless.
Richard Gardner’s words about the ‘ignominious fate’ of the ITO
resonate here: ‘It did not have a chance to die: it was simply
stillborn.’ This outcome cannot be understood without a brief
examination of the content of the Havana Charter. Within the
expanse of its mandate and the details of its organization lay the
seeds of its failure.
The ITO envisaged by the Havana Charter had a far-reaching
mandate, and an elaborate organization to implement it. This
expansive mandate was very much a product of the post-war
context. The liberalizing ITO was charged with the tasks of solving
many of the problems that we see today as belonging inside the
borders of states, but which were especially serious concerns in the
post-war years. Hence, besides covering the obvious area of
commercial policy, the 106 articles of the ITO extended to areas of
employment, economic development, restrictive business practices,
and commodity agreements. It gave recognition to the importance
of ensuring fair labour standards, and also incorporated provisions
that allowed governments to address their development and
humanitarian concerns.
The Havana Charter endowed the ITO with a detailed
organizational structure to implement its mandate. It was
envisaged explicitly as a specialized agency of the United Nations.
The articles provided detailed prescriptions regarding decisionmaking procedures. They also provided for the creation of an
Executive Board of 18 members, to be voted for by two-thirds
majority, with 8 places reserved for member countries ‘of chief
economic importance’. Commissions would be created to perform
the functions of the organization, which were to be appointed by the
Executive Board and also report back to the Board. The Charter also
gave the ITO the power of rule enforcement by building a clear
dispute settlement process within it. In the event of a dispute,
12

affected members were ﬁrst required to consult among themselves.
The matter could then be taken to the Executive Board, which could
arrive at a decision by majority vote. The Board could also refer the
matter to the plenary conference of the ITO. Further, any member
affected and dissatisﬁed by a decision of the Conference could refer
the matter to the International Court of Justice.

Trade-offs between the Americans and the British underlay the
greater part of the negotiation process for the Havana Charter, until
the London Conference in 1946. In London, however, developing
countries (led particularly by Brazil, Chile, and India) disrupted the
cosy consensus and demanded that the Charter include exceptions
that allowed them to impose special quantitative and other
restrictions to facilitate their economic development. These
countries were successful, and many of their demands were
incorporated into the development provisions of the Charter,
including a special section that identiﬁed economic development as
a central objective of the ITO. But the absence of these interlocutors
from the negotiation table when the idea of the ITO was conceived
meant that their demands were not fully integrated into the text.
They formed important additions to the document, and the list of
exceptions in the Charter grew.
13

Who needs an international trade organization?

Unfortunately, by logrolling the diverse and often contradictory
demands of all potential members of the ITO, the negotiators of
the Havana Charter ended up with a ﬁnal package that satisﬁed
no one. The process for negotiating the Charter had, as its
starting point, the US view that free trade was the remedy for a
variety of post-war problems, including unemployment and
economic instability. But in response to the war-torn economies of
Western Europe, and particularly as a result of pressure from
Keynesian Britain, the Charter also provided for detailed
exceptions to this principle. As a result of British pressure, the
Charter accepted the system of imperial preferences and provided
escape clauses for countries experiencing balance of payment
difﬁculties.

World Trade Organization

Domestic constituencies within the US also ensured that
exceptions were built into the broader commitment to free trade.
Hence, for instance, the Department of Agriculture managed to
secure an exception on quantitative restrictions and export
subsidies so that US agricultural policies remained largely
untouched by the ITO. The mix of commitments that resulted was
contradictory, volatile, and unsustainable. Within the US, the
Charter was severely denounced by, to use William Diebold’s terms,
the ‘perfectionists’ and the ‘protectionists’ alike. For the
perfectionists, the Charter comprised nothing but exceptions, and
did not go far enough in removing the trade barriers of other
countries. The protectionists, in turn, pointed to the adverse effects
of higher low-cost imports. Interestingly, the ITO debate catalysed
an unholy alliance of sorts between the perfectionists and the
protectionists, with these traditionally opposed groups
conveniently converging in their denunciation of the ITO for
allowing too much scope for government controls and escape
mechanisms for foreign economies. Faced with such opposition,
the possibility that the Congress would agree to ratify the Havana
Charter was slim. It is unsurprising that the ITO died before it was
born.
The failures of the ITO negotiation process struck deep. The ITO
had collapsed under the weight of its own ambitions. It taught trade
negotiators and their political masters some important lessons
about the reach that a multilateral trade organization could
politically achieve at the time. It illustrated that any multilateral
process risks derailment if it does not take into account the views of
affected constituencies, whether they are domestic interests or
smaller countries at the negotiating table. As we will see later in the
book, the lessons of the ITO experiment have acquired even greater
resonance today, when the WTO is beleaguered by demands that it
expand its regulation into domestic issues such as labour and the
environment. More immediately after its demise and with farreaching consequences that extend to the present day, the failures of
the ITO experiment helped negotiators identify the politically
14

feasible. This political feasibility was to be found in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

The coverage of the GATT was minuscule in comparison to the far
more ambitious ITO; in fact, it was no more than the commercial
policy chapter of the ITO with a weak dispute settlement
mechanism. The original document made no mention of
employment, development, restrictive business practices, or
commodity agreements, let alone covering issues such as labour
standards. Unlike the Havana Charter, which extended to domestic
constituencies through its rules on the monopolistic practices of
ﬁrms, the GATT applied only to governments. Its mandate stood
ﬁrmly outside of the boundaries of states and dealt only with
tariff barriers. Part I of the agreement established the principle
15

Who needs an international trade organization?

As early as 1945, when discussions for the ITO were underway, the
US proposed that a multilateral commercial treaty on tariff
reductions be negotiated among the participating countries. The
rationale behind this proposal was the recognition by the US
administration that though an ITO (being a multilateral
organization) would need ratiﬁcation by the Congress, a trade
agreement could be negotiated and implemented more easily under
the authority granted to the Executive by the 1945 Reciprocal Trade
Agreements Act. Simultaneously with the negotiations on the
Havana Charter, negotiations on a multilateral tariff-reduction
treaty entered into full swing at the Geneva Conference in 1947. The
result of the latter set of negotiations was the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was to serve as an interim
agreement until the ITO came into force, and covered issues that
were to be included in the Commercial Policy chapter (Chapter IV)
of the Havana Charter. It was signed accordingly by 23 countries, 11
of which were developing countries, in January 1948 and was to
provide a provisional basis for multilateral cooperation until the
ITO was formed. This temporary agreement provided the basis for
the international trading system for 47 years.

World Trade Organization

of non-discrimination by requiring that all contracting parties
accord Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to each other (though
exceptions such as imperial preferences and regional agreements
were permitted). It also included the schedules of tariff concessions.
Part III covered procedural aspects, including accessions,
amendments, and withdrawals. The substantive obligations were
included in Part II. But as the GATT had been agreed to only on a
provisional basis, the Protocol of Provisional Application allowed
an important exception for the implementation of Part II. As per
this protocol, signatory governments were required to apply Part II
only ‘to the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing legislation’.
This meant that contracting parties could claim ‘grandfather rights’
for any pre-existing legislation and would not be required to
implement the particular GATT rule.
If the coverage of the GATT presents a striking contrast to the ITO
model, perhaps even more interesting was its legal nature. The
GATT was little more than a negotiating forum, held together by a
multilateral treaty signed by contracting parties (rather than
members of an organization). To refer to joint action by the
members acting as a collective body, the term ‘CONTRACTING
PARTIES’ (in the upper case) was used, as opposed to ‘organization’
or even ‘membership’. GATT analyst Gilbert Winham has described
it as a ‘formally-contracted, rule-oriented, non-organizational form
of cooperation in international affairs’. The GATT lacked the legal
personality that international organizations enjoy, and it could not
authorize collective action against individual countries.
This primarily contractual rather than organizational character of
the GATT had some important practical implications for its
everyday functioning. Initially, the contracting parties would meet
once or twice annually, but in 1951 an inter-sessional committee was
formed speciﬁcally to organize airmail or telegraphic ballots to vote
on certain kinds of import restrictions. This was replaced by a
Council of Representatives in 1960. Again emphasizing its
provisional nature, the GATT Secretariat was known as the Interim
16

Commission for the International Trade Organization (ICITO). All
GATT proceedings were driven by the contracting parties, in which
the role of the Secretariat was minimal. Its dispute settlement
mechanism was also weak. It eventually evolved from a working
party of nations that provided a ruling in the early GATT years to a
panel of experts. But all panel reports had to be adopted by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES through consensus, and the losing
party could (and did) block or delay this adoption process.

The result of this non-existent organizational structure of the GATT
was that adherence to it was less expensive than would have been
the case for the ITO. Given these minimal costs of participation,
particularly for developed countries, it is not surprising that the
GATT survived for as long as it did. But the weakness of the
institution also meant that it did little to address the power
asymmetries that severely disadvantaged developing countries in
their trade relations. The onus of negotiating and implementing
agreements fell on the members themselves, with little help from
the Secretariat. Developing countries found themselves illequipped to participate effectively in this theoretically onemember-one-vote treaty due to their limited technical capacity.
They found themselves further handicapped as they were excluded
from the key decision-making consultations that took place in the
17

Who needs an international trade organization?

In terms of actual decision-making, the agreement entitled each
contracting party to one vote. Article XXV.5 further stated, ‘Except
as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, decisions of the
CONTRACTING PARTIES will be taken by a majority of votes
cast.’ In practice, however, the GATT evolved the norm of decisionmaking by consensus; that is, a decision would be arrived at if none
of the parties present objected to it. These decisions were usually
reached in the so-called Green Room meetings, which worked by
invitation only. Tariff negotiations were conducted primarily on the
Principal Supplier Principle: the principal suppliers and consumers
of a particular product would negotiate tariff reductions and then
extend the concessions to all contracting parties.

World Trade Organization

Green Room (the exceptions were Brazil and India, which were
original members of the GATT and regular invitees to the Green
Room meetings). These limitations of process were important in
themselves in creating a feeling of marginalization from the GATT
among its weakest members. But they also translated into the
substance of the GATT, with adverse outcomes for developing
countries.
The Principal Supplier Principle was one negotiating process that
resulted in the automatic exclusion of developing countries from
the agenda-setting process, and developed countries were able to
pack the agenda with issues of interest to themselves. Admittedly,
the concessions negotiated through the Principal Supplier Principle
were extended to all the other contracting parties, but often these
concessions were on products in which developing countries lacked
an export advantage. Products that mattered as signiﬁcant exports
from developing countries were excluded from the mandate of the
GATT through a variety of exceptions. The most infamous of these
were agriculture and textiles. The GATT had previously permitted
quotas and export subsidies on agricultural products. These rules
on agriculture were further weakened and special waivers added to
allow non-tariff barriers and quantitative restrictions. The US was
the ﬁrst to make use of such a waiver in 1955; the GATT agricultural
regime was in fact sufﬁciently loose even to permit the existence of
Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy. In the case of textiles, with
the accession of Japan in 1955, domestic industries in several
developed countries demanded the right to impose import
restrictions on cheap textile exports from Japan. A variety of
techniques were used to enable this protectionism, including
the use of ‘Voluntary Export Restraints’ from the exporting
countries. This protectionist regime eventually crystallized into
the Multi-Fibre Agreement of 1974.
Finally, development concerns that had been incorporated into the
Havana Charter were non-existent in the original GATT. Part IV on
Trade and Development was added on to the GATT in 1965 after
18

some intense lobbying by developing countries within the GATT,
the UN General Assembly, and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It recognized the principle of
non-reciprocity, but its language was weak and it delivered few
concrete measures to address development-related concerns. Given
these procedural and substantive weaknesses of the GATT as an
international institution, developing countries were quick to
dismiss it as a ‘rich man’s club’ and sought alternative forums such
as the General Assembly and the UNCTAD to enunciate their
demands.

The ﬁrst four rounds of GATT negotiations dealt primarily with
tariffs on goods. The weak institutional procedures of the GATT
also allowed it sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to innovate and adapt to at least
some international changes. Beginning in the Kennedy Round
(1964–67), and more extensively in the Tokyo Round (1973–79), the
GATT introduced a system of plurilateral codes (that is, codes
signed on a voluntary basis by some countries rather than all the
contracting parties) on issues that addressed newer forms of
19

Who needs an international trade organization?

The dissatisfaction and marginalization of the vast majority of
developing countries notwithstanding, the GATT continued to exist
for over four decades. In part, this longevity, especially remarkable
given the difﬁcult history of its unborn predecessor, derived from
its ability to suit the needs of the major traders of the Western
world. It covered the commercial interests of the developed
countries, without making any intrusions into their domestic
jurisdictions. Its weak institutional structure in terms of
negotiation processes, decision-making procedures, and dispute
settlement mechanism meant that developed countries would not
resent its gentle bindings. In other words, the weaknesses of the
GATT were critical in ensuring the commitment and participation
of the major traders – the US, the European Community, Canada,
and Japan (also known as the Quad group) – and thereby
producing a far more meaningful treaty than an ITO without the
US would have been.

protectionism. Its rules were extended to include sanitary and
phytosanitary barriers to trade, technical barriers to trade, and
other forms of Non-Tariff Barriers. The accession of developing
countries also recorded a jump in this period. The GATT was
growing in its mandate and size. In response to the changing
comparative advantage of the developed countries, the Uruguay
Round (1986–94) brought the so-called new issues within the
mandate of the GATT: services, Trade-Related Intellectual Property
20

Rights, and Trade Related Investment Measures. In return for
agreeing to these inclusions, developing countries were promised
concessions on agriculture, textiles, and industrial goods.

21

Who needs an international trade organization?

The temporary arrangement of the GATT had not only survived for
47 years, it had ﬂourished. Admittedly, it was a far less ambitious
project than the ITO, and its lack of organizational structure
generated several problems, especially as far as developing
countries were concerned. But the same weaknesses of the GATT
also ensured its political viability. The limited mandate of the GATT
meant that it was not ridden with the many contradictions and
impossible political compromises that the ITO was, while countries
showed a greater willingness to commit to a treaty than have their
hands tightly bound by a much more intrusive organization with a
powerful dispute settlement mechanism. Developing countries,
despite their frequent complaints about the exclusionary GATT
system, were falling over each other to accede to the organization.
Here was a model for a multilateral trade regime – if not an
organization – that seemed to be working. Yet, in 1995, the old
GATT was replaced with a new organization: the World Trade
Organization.

Chapter 2
The creation of the World
Trade Organization

The formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 was a
momentous event, particularly when held up against the history of
unsuccessful attempts to establish such an organization. In this
chapter, I analyse the political processes that led to the replacement
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with this
new organization, and highlight the continuities and differences
between the WTO and its predecessor.

Explaining the formation of the WTO
The creation of an international trade organization was a dream
that had evaded trade negotiators of the post-war era for almost
50 years. The GATT was considered a poor substitute to the aborted
International Trade Organization (ITO). But the attempts to form a
multilateral trade organization continued. Some contracting parties
of the GATT proposed the formation of a more permanent body, in
the form of the Organization for Trade Cooperation, in 1955. But
this proposal was no more successful than the ITO had been. The
proposal for an international trade organization under UN auspices
that was put forth in the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
in 1963 also came to naught. But when the Marrakesh Agreement
concluded the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations
in 1994, the long-sought multilateral trade organization was born.
Legally, the WTO came into existence on 1 January 1995, with a
membership of 128 countries.
22

The creation of a multilateral trade organization was not on the
agenda when the Uruguay Round was launched. But dissatisfaction
with the GATT had been brewing in different quarters. Non-tariff
barriers had proliferated in the 1970s. The Tokyo Round’s invention
of dealing with such barriers through voluntary codes was proving
to be largely ineffective. The changing comparative advantage of
developed countries, led by the US, demanded that the GATT
would have to expand into the new issues of services, intellectual
property rights, and investment measures if it wanted to keep the
major traders aboard. Developing countries were also faced with
new imperatives. The economic downturn of the 1980s led many of
them to consider the East Asian model of export-oriented growth,
and attempt to counter their widening deﬁcits through an
expansion of world trade. To implement such a growth strategy, to
reap the beneﬁts of unilateral liberalization, to protect themselves
against increasing non-tariff barriers, and to ensure that the new
issues were included in a manner and with a trade-off that
supported their interests, developing countries had to go to the
negotiating table. In response to this rising and active membership
23

The creation of the World Trade Organization

The emergence of the WTO in 1995 was partly a response to the
changing imperatives of the international trading system in the
1980s. But its creation was also a function of the elaborate
negotiation processes that resulted in what Sylvia Ostry has
described as a ‘Grand Bargain’. Without the processes of careful
compromise and trade-offs, the WTO might have suffered the same
fate as the ITO. In this section, we will rely on both sets of
explanation – changing imperatives and negotiation processes – to
analyse the formation of the WTO. One caveat, however, is worth
bearing in mind. The negotiation processes and the resulting Grand
Bargain were related very closely to the GATT, even though the
WTO, as an international organization, may superﬁcially resemble
the ITO project. Subsequent chapters in this book illustrate that the
persistence of GATT practices in the everyday workings of the WTO
has had a critical inﬂuence on its nature and evolution as an
international organization.

World Trade Organization

with new demands, it was inevitable that the agenda of the GATT
was going to expand well beyond the traditional issue-areas of
tariffs on goods. The Uruguay Round certainly saw such an
expansion, and the old GATT structure was inadequate to deal
with it.
One of the central problems facing negotiators in the Uruguay
Round was to provide some coherence and integration to the
multiple agreements that had emerged by the end of the Tokyo
Round. International trade lawyer John Jackson pointed out that
some of these codes were inconsistent with each other, and were
enforced by different dispute settlement agreements with different
memberships. It was recognized that unless a mechanism for
coordinating this unwieldy set of agreements was found, the new
agreements that were being negotiated in the Uruguay Round
would make the system unsustainable. As a solution to this
problem, Jackson proposed the creation of a world trade
organization.
Coherence was not only a problem internal to the GATT, but also
appeared in its dealings with the liberalization programmes that
were managed by the World Bank and the IMF. A mechanism was
needed to facilitate greater coordination between the GATT, the
World Bank, and the IMF for the coherence of the international
economic system. A trade organization, which might be able to
maintain such external relations with other international
organizations, emerged as the solution.
Once the idea of a world trade organization had been voiced, some
contracting parties in the GATT began to see its advantages.
Canada emerged as an active supporter, as did the EU. John
Croome has traced the negotiating history of the Uruguay Round,
and points out that the ﬁrst formal paper for the establishment of
such an organization came from the EU in June 1990. Besides
meeting the need for greater coherence among the GATT codes, the
EU proposal argued that a single dispute settlement system within
24

the auspices of such an organization would be particularly
advantageous. It also proposed that the limited nature of the GATT
prevented it from taking on important functions such as trade
policy reviews of the contracting parties and external negotiations
with international organizations. The EU and Canada subsequently
produced several detailed proposals together for the creation and
running of a multilateral trade organization. But many countries
still had to be convinced about the idea.

The US resistance to the organization under discussion was the
longest-lasting. Gilbert Winham, drawing on the account by Deputy
Director-General Warrant Lavorel, identiﬁes the trade-off in which
the US ﬁnally gave up its opposition in 1993. The US Chief
Negotiator is reported to have said that the administration would be
willing to rethink its opposition if all the other problems in the
Round could be solved so that the administration would not risk
opposition in the Congress by speciﬁc constituencies. The US ﬁnally
dropped its opposition in return for an EU concession on computer
chips and a change in the name of the organization from a
Multilateral Trade Organization to the World Trade Organization.
25

The creation of the World Trade Organization

The suspicion of developing countries towards the idea of a
multilateral trade organization was countered by incorporating the
creation of the WTO into the Grand Bargain. In return for the
inclusion of the ‘new issues’, the Single Undertaking, and the new
organization of the WTO with its strengthened dispute settlement
mechanism, developing countries were granted the inclusion of
agriculture and textiles, and also special and differential treatment
through longer time periods for implementing some of the new
agreements. Once the Single Undertaking was extended to cover
the Agreement establishing the WTO, the only choice that
developing countries had was between agreeing to the entire
package, including its potential costs, or surrendering all the new
opportunities that the Uruguay Round agreements had opened up.
They accepted the whole package and became members of the
organization.

World Trade Organization

3. The Final Act, marking the completion of the Uruguay Round, was
signed in April 1994, at Marrakesh, Morocco. This comprehensive trade
agreement covered 29 agreements that included the ‘new issues’ of
services, intellectual property rights, and investment measures, and an
additional 36,000 pages of national schedules on goods and services.

The creation of the WTO was certainly a response to problems with
which the old GATT structure could no longer cope. But its creation
was equally a result of the conscious exclusion of certain
controversial areas and weak agreements in others. The Agreement
on Agriculture was an important step in bringing agriculture into
the fold of some general rules. But as Chapter 4 shows, the
Agreement left vast scope for continued protectionism to meet the
requirements of the major trading nations. The General Agreement
on Trade in Services included Mode 4, that is, trade in services
through the movement of people, but actual commitments on this
mode were few. Unlike the ITO, and in continuation with GATT
practices, the WTO coverage did not extend to labour standards,
commodity agreements, or monopolistic business practices. The
next chapter demonstrates that despite attempts to formalize and
legalize some of the decision-making procedures, the WTO adhered
to GATT practices. These exclusions and weaknesses have, in
26

several instances, created inconsistencies within the WTO, which
will also be discussed later in the book. But at least at the time of its
creation, these limitations ensured the support of the major trading
nations. The foundations of the WTO rested ﬁrmly on its limited
ambition.

The creation of the World Trade Organization

4. The Centre William Rappard – the building that had housed the
GATT Secretariat since 1977 – continues to serve as the home for the
WTO. It was the ﬁrst building erected speciﬁcally to house an
international organization. Prior to moving into the Centre William
Rappard, the GATT Secretariat was housed in the Villas Bocage and
Fenêtre, located in close proximity to the Palais des Nations, the UN
headquarters in Geneva.
27

Principles underlying the WTO

World Trade Organization

Two key principles underlie the agreements of the WTO. Both are
GATT-derived and point to the continuities between the WTO and
its predecessor.
The idea of non-discrimination holds the key to multilateralism
in the GATT and the WTO. In their seminal work on the
WTO, Bernard Hoekman and Michel Kostecki identify two
components to the principle of non-discrimination: the Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) rule and national treatment. The
MFN rule in the WTO derives from Article 1 in the GATT.
Paraphrased by Hoekman and Kostecki, the rule ‘requires that
a product made in one member country be treated no less
favourably than a like good that originates in any other country’.
In other words, a concession granted by any one party to another
in the WTO must be multilateralized to all other parties. The
MFN rule applies to all issues included within the mandate of
the WTO. The exceptions allowed are few and clearly speciﬁed.
They extend to regional trade agreements, preferential
treatment for developing countries, and the invocation of a
non-application clause by an existing member against a newly
acceding country.
The second aspect of the principle of non-discrimination –
national treatment – requires member countries to treat foreign
goods no less favourably than domestically produced like goods,
once the former have met whatever border measures are
applied by the particular country. The national treatment
rule is derived from Part II of the original GATT. However, as
explained in Chapter 1, the Protocol of Provisional Application
had allowed countries to circumvent national treatment by
claiming grandfathering rights. This has changed with the
creation of the WTO, in which national treatment is a general
obligation in all issue areas, with the sole exception of trade in
services.
28

In addition to these two broad principles, the WTO resembles the
GATT through its reliance on transparency, enforceability of the
commitments, and the existence of ‘safety valves’ that allow
governments to restrict trade under certain circumstances. In fact,
the formation of the WTO has enhanced the transparency
requirement and enforceability provisions of the agreements. Not
only are members required to publish their trade regulations and
notify changes, but their policies are subject to surveillance by the
Secretariat through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism. Should a
country renege on its commitments, the stronger dispute
29

The creation of the World Trade Organization

The second principle underlying all WTO agreements is reciprocity,
which also guided all tariff reductions under the GATT. Reciprocity
is an important mechanism that limits free riding (that might
otherwise become rampant on the strength of the nondiscrimination principle). It also makes the process of agreeing to
tariff concessions politically palatable at home. This same principle
of reciprocity, however, has been a sore point in the relations of
developed and developing countries in both the GATT and the
WTO. The Indian delegate is widely cited as having declaimed in
the early years of the GATT: ‘Equality of treatment is equitable only
among equals. A weakling cannot carry the burden of a giant.’ The
principle of non-reciprocity for developing countries was
begrudgingly accepted in the GATT in the Tokyo Round through
the ‘Enabling Clause’. This provision created a legal basis in the
GATT for the Generalized System of Preferences – a system of
special and differential treatment (S&D) – that had been
established under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development. But this provision itself ironically came
with a quid pro quo by the inclusion of the graduation principle,
which requires developing countries to return to the game of
multilateral reciprocity once they have moved up the development
ladder. In the WTO, the provisions of S&D have been further
diluted and largely limited to longer time periods for
implementation of the agreements and technical assistance to
facilitate this.

settlement of the WTO can authorize punitive measures. These
features are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5.

So how is the WTO different from the GATT?

World Trade Organization

The preceding sections have illustrated the continuities between the
GATT and the WTO. The latter continues to function as a forum for
negotiations and provides a code of conduct as the GATT had done.
These continuities, however, beg the question why the WTO has
attracted so much more popular angst and apprehension than its
predecessor ever did. The answer lies in the legal nature of the
WTO, which makes it quite a different animal from the GATT.
Despite their many similarities, the two differ markedly in six
important ways.
First, the GATT was legally no more than a multilateral treaty
among contracting parties; the WTO is an international
organization with a membership. Article I of the Agreement
establishing the WTO explicitly refers to the establishment of an
organization. The WTO is entrusted with the task of providing ‘the
common institutional framework for the conduct of trade relations
among its Members’ (Article II). The Agreement speciﬁes an
elaborate organizational structure that is to underlie the
functioning of the WTO and further enables the organization to
cooperate with other international organizations that have
responsibilities related to the WTO’s. The WTO enjoys a legal
personality that the GATT could not.
Second, as the last chapter explained, the GATT was applied only
on a provisional basis; the Protocol of Provisional Application
(‘Grandfather Clause’) exempted contracting parties from applying
some important GATT articles if they were inconsistent with
existent legislation. The WTO, in contrast, was created as an
organization in its own right rather than as a provisional measure.
As a result, even though the US managed to preserve one
grandfather right, the general principle of grandfather rights no
30

longer exists. This means that member countries can no longer
appeal to pre-existing domestic legislation to avoid adherence to the
agreements of the WTO. They will have to do whatever it takes,
even if this involves amending domestic laws, to abide by the rules
of the WTO or risk retaliation.
The third feature of the WTO that distinguishes it from the GATT
is that all its agreements (including the Dispute Settlement
Understanding, besides the substantive agreements on goods,
services, investment measures, and intellectual property rights)
are held together by the Single Undertaking. The Single
Undertaking means that participating countries cannot selectively
apply the range of agreements that exist within the WTO. The
Single Undertaking approach presents the polar opposite of the
approach that the GATT had evolved by the time of the Tokyo
Round. By the end of the 1970s, the GATT had come to include
several plurilateral agreements that countries could pick and
choose to abide by. The resulting large cluster of over 180
31

5. The adoption of the ofﬁcial logo of the WTO was described by the
then Director-General, Mr Renato Ruggiero, as ‘another step in
establishing this unique institution on a ﬁrm and lasting foundation’

World Trade Organization

agreements often produced differing purposes, differing
memberships, and included agreements that were sometimes
inconsistent with the GATT. The Single Undertaking sought to get
rid of these legal inconsistencies and complexities. Given the range
of issues covered in the Uruguay Round, the Single Undertaking
was also a device to catalyse trade-offs among negotiating
countries across issues, and thereby facilitate an overall
multilateral agreement that met the top priorities of most parties.
When the Uruguay Round was completed, the Single Undertaking
concept was developed to mean that all the signatories to the
Marrakesh Agreement would have to become members of the
WTO. The WTO, and all the agreements within its umbrella, came
as a single package, which countries would have to accept on an
all-or-nothing basis.
Fourth, the mandate of the WTO was signiﬁcantly more intrusive
than that of GATT. The GATT’s foray into rules on non-tariff
barriers (NTBs) had been only through the mechanism of the
plurilateral codes. This changed in the WTO through the Single
Undertaking. But further, the Uruguay Round expanded the reach
of the agreements to issues that went well beyond border measures.
The WTO covers not only the traditional area of trade in goods, as
per the GATT, but also has agreements on services, trade-related
intellectual property rights (TRIPs), and trade-related investment
measures (TRIMs). Even in the case of trade in goods, the WTO
now extends its regulation to issues such as sanitary and
phytosanitary barriers to trade (SPS) and technical barriers to trade
(TBT).
Fifth, again in response to the problems that arose from having
several different dispute resolution arrangements that matched
with the particular plurilateral code of the Tokyo Round, the WTO
has a signiﬁcantly stronger Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM).
A detailed discussion of the DSM appears in Chapter 5. Sufﬁce it to
note at this point that the WTO’s DSM enjoys the rule of ‘negative
consensus’. This means that to overturn the ﬁndings of a panel,
32

there has to be a consensus on the overrule (as opposed to the GATT
practice, where consensus was required for the adoption of a panel
ruling, which gave the losing party the right to block). Further, the
Single Undertaking allows cross-issue retaliation under the DSM,
so countries can punish violators of agreements where it hurts them
most.

Given all the above features, members of the WTO are far more
deeply bound to its rules than the contracting parties of the
GATT ever were. These rules are more intrusive than those
negotiated in the GATT; they are more formalized; and they
enjoy increased enforceability through the enhanced DSM that
the previous regime could not afford. The organizational
structure of the WTO provides an excellent illustration of how
the WTO builds on some old GATT features but formalizes and
legalizes them in a way so unprecedented that the resulting
change is a qualitative one.

Organizational structure
Article IV of the Agreement establishing the WTO speciﬁes its
organizational structure. An overview of the structures provides us
with the ﬁrst cut towards an understanding of how democratic,
egalitarian, or efﬁcient the WTO is as an international
organization.
33

The creation of the World Trade Organization

Finally, given the new organizational stature of the WTO, the
Secretariat has now been formally constituted to replace the
Interim Commission for the International Trade Organization
(ICITO) of the GATT. It is true that the WTO Secretariat, to this
day, remains minuscule in comparison to those of the IMF and the
World Bank. But its powers have been considerably expanded
since GATT days, including greater surveillance functions
through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (to be discussed
in Chapter 5).

World Trade Organization

6. In May 1995, Renato Ruggiero took over from Peter Sutherland as
the new Director-General of the WTO

Perhaps the most important feature of the structure of the WTO
is that it is a member-driven organization. It stands here in
striking contrast to the IMF and the World Bank, which have
been described as staff-driven organizations, where governments
work in close conjunction with the staff and the Executive Board.
In the WTO, the onus of negotiating the agreements,
34

implementing them, and enforcing them falls on the members
themselves. This member-driven character of the WTO derives
directly from the GATT, whose lack of organizational status
placed all responsibilities for conducting any treaty-related
business on the signatories themselves. Delegation of powers to a
secretariat or an executive board was impossible under the
circumstances. The WTO has continued this practice. If there is
any international organization whose structure ensures that it is
made of its members, for its members, and by its members, the
WTO is it.

The Secretariat is headed by the director-general, whose ‘powers,
duties, conditions of service and term of ofﬁce’ are all determined
by the members in the form of the Ministerial Conference. In
practice, however, this is a powerful position, and directorgenerals in the past have played a central role in the negotiation
35

The creation of the World Trade Organization

The ﬂip side of this coin is the small size of the WTO Secretariat and
its limited functions of providing technical and administrative
support for the members. The Secretariat has been formally
constituted in the WTO on a permanent basis, and thereby presents
a departure from the temporary secretariat of the GATT. Some of its
powers have been expanded in its role of providing technical
assistance and conducting Trade Policy Reviews. But in most other
matters, the nature of the WTO Secretariat is not very different
from the GATT’s. In comparison to other international
organizations, the WTO Secretariat continues to be small; at the
time of writing, it comprised only about 600 members of staff (in
contrast to the well over 6,000-strong World Bank). Unlike the
Fund and the Bank, which generate their own income, the WTO
budget is small and comes from the contributions of members.
These contributions are assessed according to the trade shares of
the member countries. Countries may, in addition to their
contribution, voluntarily provide funds directed towards speciﬁc
purposes, such as the provision of technical assistance and
capacity-building by the Secretariat.

World Trade Organization

process as agenda-setters and mediators. Countries have therefore
vied hard to place their favoured candidate into this choice
position, and the selection process has been a fraught one.
Animosities came to the fore in the lead-up to the Seattle
Ministerial Conference in 1999, when the term of Renato
Ruggiero, the ﬁrst director-general of the WTO, was coming to
an end. Precious time that should have been spent over the
agenda for the Seattle Ministerial was instead lost in the
leadership struggle, and is seen by many as having contributed to
the failure of the Seattle Ministerial Conference. A compromise
was ﬁnally arrived at, and it was agreed that the term of the
director-general would be shared between the two candidates,
with Mike Moore of New Zealand succeeding Ruggiero for three
years, and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand taking over for the
next three years. Learning from bitter experience, negotiators
came up with a set of guidelines to assist in subsequent selection
processes and mitigate potential conﬂict, even though most
recognize that it will be impossible to sanitize the process from
realpolitik.
The Ministerial Conference constitutes the topmost decisionmaking body in the WTO, thereby reinforcing its member-driven
character. It is made up of the ministers responsible for trade
affairs for all its member countries. The Ministerial Conference has
a long-established tradition in the GATT. But in the GATT, these
conferences were held infrequently, usually at the time of the
launch of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO
institutionalized the Ministerial Conference through Article IV.1 of
the Agreement: ‘There shall be a Ministerial Conference composed
of representatives of all the Members, which shall meet at least
once every two years.’ While this practice ensures a political
commitment and institutional continuity for the WTO that the
GATT never enjoyed, it has also come under criticism. Many
developing countries complain that the frequency of ministerial
meetings imparts a pace to WTO negotiations that they cannot
keep up with.
36

The everyday functioning of the WTO is managed through an
elaborate structure that is based in Geneva and is also composed of
its members, illustrated in Figure 7. Except for about 22 countries,
all the other members of the WTO send delegations to their
permanent missions in Geneva to enable participation in the WTO.
The topmost Geneva-based WTO body is the General Council,
which carries out the functions assigned to it by the agreements and
by the Ministerial Conference. The General Council meets regularly
at the WTO headquarters in Geneva and is open to all the delegates.
It also meets in the guise of the Trade Policy Review Body and
Dispute Settlement Body.

At the next level are committees that deal with speciﬁc issues in
goods and services, and thus exist within the auspices of the sectoral
37

The creation of the World Trade Organization

Below the General Council are three sector-speciﬁc councils: the
Council for Trade in Goods, the Council for Trade in Services, and
the Council for Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights. At the
same level as these three councils are ﬁve committees that deal
with more speciﬁc issues. Their coverage extends to trade and
environment; trade and development (with a sub-committee on
Least Developed Countries); regional trade agreements; balance of
payments restrictions; and budget, ﬁnance, and administration. In
addition to these, there are working parties dealing with
accessions, and working groups that carry out exploratory work in
the areas of trade and investment, competition policy, and
transparency in government procurement. The three councils, and
the independent committees, working parties, and working groups,
report back to the General Council. Plurilateral committees,
dealing with a small group of agreements signed only by a part of
the membership, also form part of the GATT structure. At the time
of a multilateral negotiation, new committees can be created to
facilitate the negotiation process. In 2001, for instance, at the
Doha Ministerial Conference, a new Trade Negotiations
Committee was created to negotiate the Doha Development
Agenda (discussed in Chapter 6).

7. The organizational structure of the WTO

committees on Trade in Goods and Trade in Services. All these
meetings are open to the entire membership of the WTO. The
exceptions are the committees on the plurilateral agreements, the
Textiles Monitoring Body, and the dispute settlement panels and
Appellate Body.

All the organizational structures of the WTO are constituted by
member governments and their representatives. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or interest groups have no
direct entry into the WTO. Article V.2 of the Agreement
establishing the WTO states only that: ‘The General Council may
make appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation
with non-governmental organizations concerned with matters
related to those of the WTO.’ Particularly in the aftermath of the
debacle at the Seattle Ministerial Conference in 1999, where the
legitimacy of the WTO came under serious challenge as a result
of mass demonstrations by NGOs of various descriptions, the
WTO has made some attempt to engage with non-governmental
actors. NGOs can go through a process of accreditation and gain
access to some meetings in the Ministerial Conferences. The
Appellate Body has also begun to allow amicus curiae briefs
(literally, ‘friend of the court’) from NGOs (to be discussed in
39

The creation of the World Trade Organization

All the councils, committees, working groups, and working parties
meet according to the Members’ agenda at the time and their
requirements. But the expansiveness of the WTO agenda, and the
resulting proliferation of appropriate organizational structures, is
reﬂected in the very large number of meetings that are called in the
WTO. In addition to these formal meetings, WTO diplomacy
thrives on informal meetings at different levels (discussed in detail
in the next chapter). Hoekman and Kostecki, writing in 2001,
estimated that all these formal and informal meetings added up to
about 1,200 meetings a year. With the launch of a new round of
Multilateral Trade Negotiations as per the Doha Development
Agenda of November 2001, the number of these meetings has
increased further.

Chapter 5). But even here, the WTO website provides the
following interpretation:
When the Appellate Body receives unsolicited briefs directly from
an amicus curiae, the entity ﬁling the brief has no right to have it
considered. Nonetheless, the Appellate Body maintains that it has
authority to accept and consider any information it considers
pertinent and useful in deciding an appeal, including unsolicited

World Trade Organization

amicus curiae submissions.

All in all, if a particular interest group wishes to inﬂuence WTO
rules, it can do so only through its government. Of course,
WTO ofﬁcials and negotiators recognize that their decisions
affect domestic constituencies within countries. But given the
member-driven character of the organization, the onus of dealing
with the distributive consequences of WTO regulations falls on the
member governments rather than the WTO as an international
organization.
An analysis of the structures of the WTO reveals an interesting
paradox. In many ways, the WTO is one of the most expansive and
intrusive organizations of its time. Its Ministerial Conference and
many committees make rules that go deep inside the borders of
states. Members must adhere to these rules or face retaliation. But
simultaneously, the legacy of the GATT has ensured that the WTO
is also a very weak organization in other ways. The organization, up
to its highest decision-making body – the Ministerial Conference –
is made up of the members themselves. The members have not had
to surrender any of their decision-making powers to a secretariat, or
delegate them to an executive body. Any rules that the members
must implement are ones that they themselves made in the councils
and committees (which are open to all of them). Any punitive action
has to be exercised by the member rather the collective body, and
even the Dispute Settlement Body that authorizes such retaliations
is ultimately the same as the General Council and therefore
constituted by country delegates. Given this rather frail existence of
40

the WTO as an international organization, one might well wonder
why the WTO has attracted charges of a democratic deﬁcit. The
answer can be found, not in the seemingly democratic structures of
the WTO, but in the processes of negotiation and decision-making
that underlie them.

The creation of the World Trade Organization

41

Chapter 3
Decision-making and
negotiation processes

The WTO, as an international organization, is characterized by a
legalism that had evaded the GATT because of its provisional
nature. But as we shall ﬁnd in this chapter, alongside the powerful
legalism of its agreements, structures, and enforcement capacity sit
informal and ad hoc GATT-derived decision-making and
negotiation processes. These processes may have worked for the
GATT, whose legal standing, mandate, and active membership were
limited, and which could (just about) function as an exclusive
club. But the use of those same processes by the signiﬁcantly more
powerful WTO is highly problematic. At the heart of the WTO lies
a major and unsustainable discrepancy: extreme legalization,
particularly in the enforcement of its rules through the dispute
settlement mechanism, on the one hand, and an inordinate reliance
on de facto improvisation in the making of those rules, on the other.
This incongruity is important in terms of the coherence (or the lack
thereof ) of the WTO as an international institution. But it also has
some far-reaching implications for the existing power asymmetries
within the WTO.
In this chapter, I will explore the principal features of these
processes, and illustrate ways in which rules and procedures
make a difference. My central argument here is that the standard
operating procedures of the WTO are a reﬂection of power
imbalances between the developed and developing countries, and
they further exacerbate these inequalities. The ﬁrst part of the
42

chapter focuses on decision-making processes in the WTO, while
the second highlights its negotiation rules and formulae.

Decision-making processes in the WTO
In terms of its everyday workings, the WTO codiﬁes many of the
processes that had evolved in the GATT regime. Three features are
central to all its decision-making processes: voting rules, the norm
of consensus-based decision-making, and the importance of
informal procedures that underlie all the stated formalities.

Voting procedures

In terms of the actual counting of votes, most important decisions
in the WTO are supposed to be taken by means of a simple majority.
Exceptions to this rule are speciﬁed in Articles IX and X of the
Agreement and in the relevant plurilateral agreement. In this
matter too, the WTO presents a contrast to the IMF and the World
Bank, where most decisions require an 85% majority. This gives
effective veto power to the US, which commands about 17.5% of
the votes. The requirement of a simple majority for a decision to
be accepted in the WTO is important in that it imparts considerable
voting power to developing countries, which form well over
two-thirds of the entire membership. Interestingly, however,
developing countries have never actually sought recourse to their
43

Decision-making and negotiation processes

First, and deriving directly from GATT practice, the WTO is a
one-member-one-vote organization, in striking contrast to the IMF
and the World Bank which have systems of weighted voting. For
instance, in the case of the IMF, the voting power of countries
depends on the size of their respective quotas, which in turn are
supposed to reﬂect their weights in the international economy.
The Agreement establishing the WTO, however, explicitly states
that each member shall have one vote in meetings, and further
ensures that formal meetings, barring a few exceptions that were
highlighted in the previous chapter, shall be open to the entire
membership.

overwhelming strength in numbers, in contrast to the UN General
Assembly, which has often been ridden with the tyranny of the
majority. The reason for this can be found in the second tenet of
WTO decision-making: the norm of consensus.

World Trade Organization

Decision-making on the basis of consensus
Despite the existence of elaborate voting procedures, most decisions
in the GATT were in practice taken on the basis of consensus. This
GATT practice has been codiﬁed in Article IX.1 of the Agreement
establishing the WTO. Consensus is arrived at ‘if no Member,
present at the meeting when the decision is taken, formally objects
to the proposed decision’. The most immediate power implication
of this practice is that developing countries have never been able to
make use of the power of large numbers in the GATT or the WTO.
But consensus-based decision-making disadvantages developing
countries in several other ways.

8. Consensus-based decision-making at work!
44

The importance of informal processes in WTO diplomacy
The importance of informal processes in the WTO derives at least
partly from the GATT’s use of the so-called Principal Supplier
Principle (PSP), which usually involved initial discussions between
the principal supplier and consumer rather than an open discussion
involving the entire membership. It is also a product of the equal
representation that it allows its members, which means that several
other processes are needed besides the plenary meetings to beat the
45

Decision-making and negotiation processes

First, the simple requirement of the consensus norm, that no
member present objects to the decision, translates into quite a
difﬁcult condition for developing countries. About 22 member
countries of the WTO have no delegations present in Geneva to
voice their objection to the decision under discussion. Even for
those countries with a presence in Geneva, attendance is an issue
when several parallel meetings are involved. In a study that this
author conducted in 2001, the average size of a developing country
delegation was less than half the average size of a developed country
delegation. Even a presence in all the multiple meetings in the WTO
is difﬁcult under these circumstances, let alone an informed and
active presence. Especially in the context of the member-driven
character of the WTO (discussed in the previous chapter), where
the onus of preparation and participation for a WTO meeting falls
on the members themselves, developing countries ﬁnd themselves
ill-equipped to participate effectively in the consensus-making
process. Second, deriving again from the GATT, exclusive,
club-like meetings are often used for the purpose of reaching
consensus. As the majority developing countries have traditionally
found themselves frequently excluded from such meetings,
consensus-based decision making is interpreted by at least some
countries as an exclusionary device that the strong use against the
weak. Small-group meetings in the WTO, however, are not simply
a product of the consensus norm. Rather, they form part of the
third feature of WTO decision-making: a general culture, again
GATT-derived, which has thrived on informal diplomatic
procedures rather than formal rules of negotiation.

World Trade Organization

consensus into shape. The importance of informal processes in
trade diplomacy is recognized even on the WTO website. Some
informal consultations, such as the Heads of Delegations meetings
(HODs), can involve the entire membership. Others involve
smaller groups, such as the so-called Green Room meetings that
take place at the initiative of the director-general. The existence of
these informal processes allows members to exercise the ﬂexibility
that is often key to brokering compromise in a difﬁcult trade
negotiation. But when informality and a lack of rules become
effectively written into the very basis of an institution, two sets of
problems emerge.
The ﬁrst set of problems is a lack of transparency and predictability.
For developing countries, which attach considerable value to the
predictability that comes from belonging to a rules-based
institution, informality generates some serious difﬁculties. Green
Room meetings in the GATT, and the WTO, were until recently
especially notorious for this: the old-style Green Room worked by
invitation only, and even the list of invitees was treated as
conﬁdential. Particularly in the aftermath of the failed Seattle
Ministerial Conference, the opaqueness of such consultations and
their exclusionary effects came under severe criticism. For instance,
before the Seattle talks were brought to a close, African trade
ministers issued the following statement on 2 December 1999:
There is no transparency in the proceedings and African countries
are being marginalised and generally excluded on issues of vital
importance for our peoples and their future. We are particularly
concerned over the stated intentions to produce a ministerial text at
any cost including at the cost of procedures designed to secure
participation and consensus.
We reject the approach that is being employed and we must point
out that under the present circumstances, we will not be able to join
the consensus required to meet the objectives of the Ministerial
Conference.
46

The second set of problems resulting from the lack of speciﬁc rules
to govern the WTO is that it makes the WTO especially prone to
power-based improvisation. In the absence of generally agreed rules
47

Decision-making and negotiation processes

A group of Latin American and Caribbean countries issued a
similar statement. In the face of such trenchant criticism, a
conscious attempt has been made by all parties concerned to
improve the process. The schedules of small-group meetings
and the list of invitees are now announced; members can
self-select participation; at least some minutes are published;
and the meetings are open-ended and directed only towards
consensus-building rather than any decision-making. But several
problems persist. Often developing countries ﬁnd that they are not
well-equipped to even identify their interests in some of the highly
technical areas to claim their right to participation in a small-group
meeting. They also ﬁnd that they are unable to exercise the threat
to block in the ﬁnal stages of decision-making if they have not
attended the consensus-building small-group meetings. In addition
to this, informality places considerable discretion in the hands of
the chairpersons at all levels of the WTO hierarchy. These key
individuals deﬁne the agenda and frequency of meetings as well as
the lists of invitees, and can thereby exercise an important inﬂuence
on negotiated outcomes. In the absence of rules about exactly what
the chair can do and how he or she can do it, the role that certain
chairpersons choose to play inevitably becomes a source of conﬂict.
Finally, the importance of informal processes means that the WTO
retains what Rubens Ricupero, Secretary General of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
describes as the ‘almost English club atmosphere’ of the GATT. This
inaccessible culture of the institution, along with language barriers,
makes effective participation an especially daunting task for the
smaller and newer members of the WTO. As a result, developing
countries, in coalitions or individually, have put forth proposals for
institutional reform that envisage a WTO whose functioning is
tightly bound by a clearly speciﬁed set of formal rules and
procedures.

World Trade Organization

to deal with difﬁcult situations, we have examples of several stopgap measures that are somehow cobbled together to become a part
of the customary practice of the WTO. Decisions arrived at on the
basis of such contested rules are bound to lack legitimacy. Examples
of problems deriving from such haphazard improvisation and ad
hoc rule-making abound in the short history of the WTO. The last
Ministerial Conference that was held in Cancun in September 2003
provides some useful examples of these problems. The outcome of
the Cancun Ministerial process is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
At this point, sufﬁce it to note that conference ended in deadlock.,
which was at least as much a product of some questionable
negotiation and decision-making processes gone seriously awry, as
substantive disagreements among the negotiating parties.
All WTO Ministerial Conferences use a draft text of some kind as
the starting point for the negotiation. The traditional GATT and
WTO practice for drafting a text for a Ministerial Conference
involved putting together a ‘bracketed text’, that is, a text in which
all the contested proposals of different parties were put within
square brackets and were negotiated at the ministerial conference.
But in the run-up to the Cancun Ministerial, the Chair of the
General Council, Ambassador Carlos Perez del Castillo, issued a
draft text for the Ministerial ‘on his own responsibility’ in close
cooperation with the Director-General. The Castillo draft did ‘not
purport to be agreed in any part on this stage’, and claimed to be
without prejudice to any delegation’s position on any issue.
Nonetheless, the text played a critical role in setting the agenda for
negotiation at the Cancun Ministerial, particularly in the parts that
it chose to include and exclude. For instance, it was seen to favour
the position of some developed countries through its inclusion of
modalities for negotiating the ‘Singapore issues’ (so-called after the
Singapore Ministerial of 1996, where some developed countries had
tried to expand WTO coverage to trade and investment,
competition policy, government procurement, and trade
facilitation). Since 1996, developing countries had consistently
fought tooth and nail against even an inclusion of these issues, let
48

alone agree upon the modalities for their negotiations. The reaction
of developing countries to this text was, expectedly, hostile. They
attacked it not only for its substance, but also for constituting the
chair’s text rather than the traditional bracketed text. And yet the
Castillo draft was used as the text for the Cancun Ministerial
Conference.

Another example of such controversial rule improvisation can be
found in the notion of ‘explicit consensus’. As a result of India’s
insistence at the Doha Ministerial Conference, the ﬁnal text
agreed that negotiations on the Singapore issues would take place
in the ﬁfth ministerial conference, the Cancun Ministerial, ‘on the
basis of a decision to be taken, by explicit consensus, at that
session’. The insertion of this phrase was regarded as a major
victory for developing countries. In practice, however, the phrase
had no legal foundation or precise deﬁnition, and it left room for
the inevitable dispute that followed at Cancun. Developing
countries’ interpretation of the phrase was that explicit consensus
49

Decision-making and negotiation processes

The fact that the Castillo draft was issued in the ﬁrst place and
further utilized as the draft ministerial text in Cancun in spite of
such opposition can be explained by the precedent that it had in the
Harbinson draft. Stuart Harbinson, as the Chair of the General
Council, had issued a similar draft in the run-up to the Doha
Ministerial Conference in 2001. Developing countries had
questioned the authority of the chair to issue such a text; some had
lambasted the draft for ignoring their viewpoints. Nonetheless, the
text was used as the draft ministerial text for the Doha conference;
it provided the precedent for the Castillo draft at Cancun; and in the
absence of any rules on the process of arriving at a text or deﬁning
the role of the chair, developing countries could do little of
consequence to stop this process. The episode illustrates how, in the
absence of clear rules about decision-making in the WTO, the
powerful are able to improvise precedents to their advantage.
Attempts by the weak to overturn such precedents are usually
unsuccessful.

World Trade Organization

was necessary for any negotiation on the Singapore issues;
developed countries saw it as implying there already existed
agreement on starting the negotiations and explicit consensus was
needed only on modalities. Much of this conﬂict at Cancun could
have been avoided had there been adequate deﬁnitions and rules
in place.
Cancun also saw complaints by developing countries about the
process of appointment of the so-called ‘Facilitators’ and also the
way in which they carried out their appointed tasks. This practice of
choosing Facilitators (also referred to as ‘Friends of the Chair’), to
assist the Chairperson of the Ministerial Conference in small-group
consultations over speciﬁc issues, has some precedence in the GATT
and the WTO. However, no attempt has been made to clarify the
basis or criteria of this selection process; as a result, it has
frequently been dogged by controversy. Recognizing the crucial role
that Facilitators can play in agenda-setting, developing countries at
Cancun questioned the process of selection, and their method of
operation and resulting outcomes. Many felt that their persistent
opposition to several paragraphs within the original text,
particularly on agriculture and the Singapore issues, had been
blatantly ignored until the ﬁnal day of the conference as a result of
such poor ‘facilitating’.
Finally, the scale on which rules are missing in the WTO is
illustrated in the controversy generated by the simple decision of
drawing the conference proceedings to a close. All precedent had
led members to believe that the Cancun meeting would continue
well after the scheduled deadline of 14 September. The decision
taken by Minister Derbez to close the conference as per the
scheduled deadline generated vociferous and mixed reactions.
Some alleged that Derbez had come under US pressure; others
criticized him for his lack of appreciation of the shenanigans and
brinkmanship that have come to characterize GATT/WTO
meetings; still others praised him for managing to salvage the
conference through the perfunctory six-paragraph declaration.
50

These debates, however, miss the important purpose of belonging to
an organization such as the WTO, which is to provide its members
with a credible set of rules and guidelines for their multilateral
interaction. By adhering to old GATT habits, and its culture of
corridor diplomacy and unwritten protocols of interaction, the
WTO is unable to fulﬁl this crucial function.

Negotiation processes in the WTO

First, as the previous chapter outlined, the WTO provides its
members with two ﬁrm rules that provide the basis for all trade
negotiations under its auspices: the Most Favoured Nation (MFN)
rule and the associated principle of reciprocity. The ﬁrst extends all
concessions negotiated between two parties to the rest of the
membership, thereby expanding the pie to be shared and also
51

Decision-making and negotiation processes

The substance and evolution of the agenda of the WTO depends to
a large extent on the decision-making processes. Several of these
decision-making procedures are themselves the product of
negotiation. As we discovered in the previous section, protocols on
the negotiation of such rules are few and often result in the reliance
on de facto, controversial processes of rule formation. But especially
after the agenda is set, formal and informal negotiation processes
are crucial in determining what goes into the ﬁnal package. Without
such protocols of negotiation in place, the raison d’être for the WTO
– to provide a negotiating forum that facilitates multilateral trade
liberalization – would collapse. Of course, any negotiation is driven
by the preferences of states, their domestic constituencies, and the
individual negotiators party to the deal. But the fact that countries
engage in tariff reductions within the WTO matters: the WTO
establishes certain rules of the game, which would not
automatically come into existence and in whose absence different
outcomes would ensue. Below, I examine the principal features of
the negotiation process, and also provide examples of how
negotiation minutiae can sometimes skew outcomes in favour of the
already powerful in the WTO.

World Trade Organization

shielding countries against the vagaries of bilateralism. To guard
against free-riding and make trade liberalization politically
palatable at home, however, the second principle of reciprocity is
crucial. Concessions negotiated under these rules have to be bound;
if countries exceed the bound level, they can be penalized (barring
speciﬁc circumstances when this is allowed). While these rules
existed in the GATT, the WTO has strengthened them through its
powerful dispute-settlement mechanism that authorizes retaliation
if a party reneges on its obligations, and also by extending it to all
countries including developing countries (to be discussed in detail
in Chapter 4). It is worth bearing in mind that the two rules of MFN
and reciprocity are actually mutually contradictory. The WTO
resolves these contradictions by building in the condition of
reciprocity to MFN in the negotiation process; once the concession
has been granted, however, its multilateralization is essential and
cannot subsequently be made conditional on reciprocity.
Second, the WTO has evolved speciﬁc methods of actually
implementing the broader rules of MFN and reciprocity, with
implications for the inclusion or exclusion of certain parties and
certain agendas. For instance, in the ﬁrst ﬁve rounds under GATT
auspices, the Principal Supplier Principle was used in tariff
negotiations. As per this principle, the initial negotiation would be
conducted bilaterally among the largest countries on speciﬁc
products. Hoekman and Kostecki explain the rationale behind this:
Granting a concession to a small supplier implies giving away the
concession to the principal supplier, since the latter will beneﬁt from
it due to the MFN rule. The principal supplier is the trading nation
which beneﬁts the most from a concession and is thus probably
prepared to offer more reciprocal trade liberalization than a smaller
supplier would be prepared or able to do.

Smaller countries may enter into the negotiation in the endgame,
when the country granting a concession to the principal supplier
might make the offer conditional on gaining supplementary
52

concessions from other smaller suppliers of the same product.
However, as discussed in Chapter 1, negotiations based on this
principle resulted in the marginalization of developing countries
and their agendas from the GATT process. Further, as the number
of products on the GATT agenda and its membership expanded,
negotiations on a product-by-product basis became unmanageably
complex.

53

Decision-making and negotiation processes

To address some of the problems of the Principal Supplier Principle,
across-the-board tariff negotiations were used in the Kennedy
Round. Two types of formulae were used for this: the linear cutting
formula and the harmonizing formula. The former requires all
members to engage in the same rate of tariff cuts for all product
lines. It allows a broader coverage, but also means that countries
with higher tariffs can continue to have high tariffs in relation to
other members implementing the same rates of tariff cuts. The
harmonization formula can have many versions; depending on the
particular formula used, it can reduce higher tariffs much more
drastically than lower ones. The choice of formula can be a difﬁcult
political matter, especially as the distributive implications of each
type vary across and within countries. Exactly how politicized the
process of choosing a negotiation formula can be was illustrated at
the Cancun meeting, where one of the principal causes for the
breakdown of the negotiations was that countries could not agree
upon the formula that would provide the basis for the Doha
agricultural negotiations. Even after an across-the-board formula
was adopted in the Kennedy Round, a mix-and-match approach
was used in the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds in practice. The
Uruguay Round saw the use of a sector-by-sector approach rather
than a formula approach. Today, a mix of approaches is used
depending on the issue area. For instance, after the agreement on
the ‘July Package’ in the summer of 2004 (discussed in Chapter 6),
a tiered formula is going to be used in agriculture, while services
negotiations will continue to be on a request-offer basis among
countries. Services commitments by countries have in general
been disappointing so far; some observers attribute this to the

World Trade Organization

request-offer approach and argue that it needs to be substituted
with a more generalized approach.
Third, multilateral trade negotiations depend critically on issue
linkage for their success. Country A agrees to make a concession on
Issue I that is of value to Country B, but, in return, gains a
concession from Country B on Issue II that is of particular value to
Country A. In other words, issue linkage facilitates reciprocal
exchange. This exchange also increases the potential gains from
trade liberalization according to the respective preferences of
negotiating countries. Without such linkages, multilateral trade
liberalization would be a considerably more difﬁcult process
than it already is; indeed, the creation of the WTO would have
been impossible without them. The practice of issue linkage is
epitomized in the concept of the Single Undertaking.
While issue linkages can facilitate agreement, they also have a
negative side, as they can be used by powerful countries to extract
disproportionate concessions from their weaker counterparts.
Frequently cited examples are of the Uruguay Round, when
developing countries gained some concessions on agriculture and
textiles, but paid a heavy price for those concessions through the
inclusion of the ‘new issues’. Linkages can also extend beyond the
issue area of trade. Politicians from developed countries have been
known to offer bilateral carrots and sticks to developing countries
in return for their agreeing to withdraw from a certain position
or to agree to a concession. Examples of such carrots include
aid, low-interest loans, market access quotas, and regional trade
arrangements, while threats of withdrawing these concessions and
privileges are brandished as sticks.
Issue linkage can exacerbate power asymmetries, especially if they
are used to make weak countries pay several times over for the same
concession. The coalition of developing countries known as the Like
Minded Group (LMG) was in effect making this same argument
when it threatened to block the launch of the round of trade
54

Fourth, underlying all processes in any international organization is
its organizational culture, which can have an important effect on
the negotiation and coalition strategies that its members employ. As
was mentioned in Chapter 1, the negotiating culture of the GATT
led developing countries to label the institution a ‘rich man’s club’.
Rather than expend limited resources in a forum that seemed
weighted against them, developing countries successfully lobbied
for the creation of a different economic organization that attached
primacy to their development concerns – the UNCTAD. Their
dealings with the GATT were marginal, and even these limited
dealings were couched in a confrontational discourse. The
expansion in the agenda of the WTO and its legalization has led
developing countries to recognize that they can no longer afford to
stand at the margins. However, the similarities between the
organizational cultures of the GATT and the WTO have persisted
through the continuities in decision-making procedures as well as
the informal protocols of interaction in the Green Room and
corridors. This has led developing countries to adhere, in general, to
many of the negotiation strategies that they pursued in the GATT.
John Odell conceptualizes negotiation strategies across a
55

Decision-making and negotiation processes

negotiations that is currently underway (the so-called ‘Doha
Development Agenda’). The LMG highlighted the many problems
that developing countries have encountered in implementing the
Uruguay Round. These implementation problems referred to the
costs of implementation, as well as the fact that developed countries
have not kept their end of the Uruguay Round bargain, and hence
the fruits of the Uruguay Round have proven elusive for developing
countries. They argued that if they agreed to a new round and
gained the concession that the implementation issues would be put
onto the agenda of the new round, they would end up paying again
for the unrealized promises of the Uruguay Round through more
concessions on new issue areas. It is on account of these kinds of
negative issue linkages that the Single Undertaking has attracted
considerable criticism in certain quarters.

spectrum that ranges from value-claiming to value-creating: He
writes:
At one pole is the pure value-claiming or distributive strategy, a set
of actions that promote the attainment of one party’s goals when
they are in conﬂict with those of the other party. . . . At the opposite
pole is the pure integrative or value-creating strategy. It involves
actions that promote the attainment of goals that are not in
fundamental conﬂict – actions designed to expand rather than split

World Trade Organization

the pie.

Along this spectrum, many developing countries in the WTO have
tended to adopt the strict distributive strategy. Of course, this
tendency has several sources including the role of the particular
negotiator, the domestic political economy, and the political culture
of the country. But there are two additional factors – both relating
to the culture of the WTO – that further prompt developing
countries to adopt hard-line positions and show limited ﬂexibility in
arriving at a compromise. First, the use of the strict distributive
strategy is especially common when levels of trust among the
negotiating parties are low, and such a situation exists in the WTO.
Developing countries have long been resentful of the relative ease
with which developed countries, both in the GATT and the WTO,
have been able to bludgeon them into consensus, and keep
expanding the agenda of the organization despite the reservations
that developing countries have consistently had with this. Second,
as was outlined in the previous section of this chapter, developing
countries ﬁnd themselves poorly equipped to deal with the
technicalities of the negotiations, whereas integrative strategies
require considerable knowledge and skill. The pace of the
negotiations makes it especially difﬁcult for developing countries to
adopt proactive, positive negotiating positions, let alone formulate
fallback positions that form an essential part of an integrative
strategy. Often, they end up succumbing to pressure in the endgame
and gain few concessions. Former Indian Ambassador B. L. Das
comments on this negotiating trajectory of developing countries:
56

The transition from the long period of determined opposition to
sudden collapse into acquiescence at the end has denied these
countries the opportunity of getting anything in return for the
concessions they ﬁnally make in the negotiations.

Agreements thus arrived at further exacerbate the level of distrust
and endanger their political sustainability.

This highly asymmetric accession process notwithstanding,
countries have shown a willingness to give up rather a lot to acquire
membership of the WTO. This is because members assume that the
57

Decision-making and negotiation processes

Finally, any discussion about the norms of negotiation in the WTO
will be incomplete without a mention of the accession process. The
WTO began with a membership of 128 members; its membership
had expanded to 148 by 2005. The few remaining outside are lining
up to join the club. The accession process, however, is not an easy
one. It begins as a bilateral process, in which all interested members
can make demands of the aspirant member, and the accession
eventually has to be approved by a two-thirds majority. Acceding
countries cannot negotiate concessions beyond those covered by the
WTO agreements, but they may be asked by member countries to
surrender much more. The accession of Cambodia in 2003 – the
ﬁrst Least Developed Country (LDC) to join the WTO since its
creation in 1995 – provides a good example of how asymmetric this
process can be. An Oxfam report points out that Cambodia was
required to give up the use of generic medicines as part of its
accession package, even though the WTO actually exempts LDCs
from implementing this part of the agreement on intellectual
property rights until 2016. In agriculture, the EU and the US have
tariff peaks which are several times higher than those that
Cambodia signed on to. Unsurprisingly, the Cambodian Minister of
Commerce, Mr Cham Prasidh, is quoted as saying: ‘This is a
package of concessions and commitments that goes far beyond
what is commensurate with the level of development of an LDC like
Cambodia.’

World Trade Organization

costs of accession, as well as some questionable decision-making
procedures and politicized negotiation processes, will be easily
outweighed by the beneﬁts of belonging to the WTO. The expected
beneﬁts for developing countries (and indeed, most of the recent
accessions have been developing countries) include MFN-based
market access with all the other members, the protection of
rules against the whims of the powerful, and an enforceable
dispute-settlement mechanism to uphold that protection. Whether
these beneﬁts are actually as high as expected can perhaps be best
gauged by examining the substance of the agreements.

58

Chapter 4
The expanding mandate

We saw in Chapters 2 and 3 that the structures and processes that
underlie the workings of the WTO bear a close resemblance to those
of the GATT. However, in the expanse and reach of its mandate, the
WTO legislates and adjudicates in areas that go well beyond the
border measures that concerned its predecessor. The central
preoccupation of the GATT (as its name indicated) was with tariffs
and other related border measures that applied to trade in goods;
the agreements of the WTO cover tariffs, but also non-tariff barriers
to trade, and extend into the areas of services and intellectual
property rights. Many of these agreements take the organization
into areas that have traditionally fallen within the domestic
jurisdictions of states. In this chapter, I analyse the mandate of the
WTO through an overview of its agreements. Regulation in some of
these areas is inevitably a product of globalization that generates
new problems, which necessitate international cooperation.
However, their apparently technocratic and abstruse content
notwithstanding, rule-making in the WTO is fundamentally a
political process. The choice of what gets included in the
agreements and what gets excluded is inﬂuenced critically by the
interests of the powerful. The impact of these agreements has also
often proven to be asymmetric, with many of the promised beneﬁts
for developing countries remaining unrealized.

59

World Trade Organization

The structure of the agreements
The agreements of the WTO are a product of the negotiations of the
Uruguay Round that was completed in 1994 at Marrakesh. Legally
overarching the set of all the agreements, which together number
over 550 pages of printed text, is the Agreement establishing the
WTO. There are four key annexes to the main agreement that
contain the substance of the rules and commitments that members
must abide by. Annex 1 has three parts that cover goods, services
and intellectual property rights respectively. Contained within this
ﬁrst annex are also the schedules of commitments taken on by each
member country that extend to over 30,000 printed pages! Annex 2
and 3 are on the Dispute Settlement Understanding and the Trade
Policy Review Mechanism. Finally, Annex 4 covers the four
plurilateral agreements, i.e. agreements signed by sub-sets of the
entire membership. Besides these, several other legal texts have
been added to the repertoire of agreements since 1994 such as the
protocols on accession, the International Technology Agreement
and the understanding on ﬁnancial services. In this chapter, we will
focus speciﬁcally on the three pillars of Annex 1, though some
mention will be made of some of the plurilateral agreements.
Annexes 2 and 3 are analysed in the next chapter.
The only substantive overlap between the agreements of the WTO
and the preceding GATT regime is Annex 1A, i.e. the agreement
dealing with trade in goods. This agreement is known as GATT
1994, and should not be confused with GATT 1947, which was a
more limited agreement in the coverage of its multilateral
disciplines. GATT 1947 dealt mainly with tariff barriers to trade in
goods. The GATT’s foray into non-tariff barriers had been through
voluntary plurilateral codes of the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds. The
WTO integrates these multiple disciplines into the Single
Undertaking by incorporating them in the multilateral rules of
GATT 1994. As a result, GATT 1994 plunges into areas that lay
outside the direct purview of GATT 1947 such as technical barriers
to trade, government procurement, anti-dumping, customs

Round – are not border measures but non-tariff barriers associated
with domestic regulation, their inclusion within the WTO takes the

organization ﬁrmly inside the terrain of domestic governance. The
WTO retains many of the structures and procedures of its
predecessor, but its regulations go into areas that the GATT never
did, nor was intended to.
The reasons for this dramatic switch in the mandate of the WTO
from the GATT model can be found in two phenomena. The ﬁrst
was the shift in the production patterns and comparative advantage
of the developed countries, beginning with the US, from production
of industrial products to services and intellectual property rights. It
was inevitable that any trade organization, to sustain the
commitment of the developed countries, would have to cover issues
that were of paramount interest to them. The agenda of the
Uruguay Round was driven by this evolving comparative advantage
of the developed world. In the 1980s, the ‘GATT bicycle theory’ –
attributed to economist Fred Bergsten – was commonly cited: if the
GATT bicycle did not continue to move forward, it would topple
over. The expanded WTO agenda may thus be seen as part of the
same process of adaptation to the changing comparative advantage
of member countries.
The second reason for the wider mandate of the WTO lay in the very
achievements of the GATT, which had been extremely successful in
the reduction of tariffs on industrial products. But as tariff barriers
were prohibited, countries began to resort to non-tariff forms of
protectionism. Robert Baldwin, in an oft-quoted and memorable
analogy, has thus likened trade liberalization to draining a
swamp: as successful pumping efforts leads to a fall in the water
level (tariffs), they also reveal rocks, stumps and other obstacles
(non-tariff barriers) that lie below the surface. To clear this drained
land necessitates intrusions into the domestic regulatory regimes of
member states. From this perspective, the expansion in the agenda
of the WTO represents little more than the next and inevitable step
in the process of trade liberalization. That expansion of the WTO’s
agenda, however, did not determine the actual content of its rules.
In the following sections, I argue that exactly what gets regulated
62

and with whose rules depends considerably on the power balances in
the WTO and further affect inequality and marginalization within
the organization.

The Multilateral Agreement on Trade in
Goods/ GATT 1994

The reason why GATT 1994 was able to emerge at all in its
impressive, expansive form lies in the negotiated compromise of
the Uruguay Round. GATT 1994, with its tariff bindings, coverage
of non-tariff barriers, and stringent transparency requirements
formed part of the so-called ‘Grand Bargain’ of the Uruguay Round
of trade negotiations. Developing countries agreed to accept
considerably more rigorous disciplines that extended into the
domestic domain and into new areas that went considerably beyond
the traditional sector of goods as the next sections illustrate. In
return, they were promised that their major concerns would be
63

The expanding mandate

GATT 1994 builds on GATT 1947 and continues to deal with
reductions in the barriers – tariffs and non-tariffs – to trade in
goods. It includes the general rules that are to be applied to trade in
goods, and contains the detailed schedules of commitments by
individual countries on tariff reductions and bindings. Its general
disciplines cover areas such as Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status,
national treatment, customs valuation, elimination of quantitative
restrictions, and emergency actions to restrict imports. To
paraphrase Bernard Hoekman and Michel Kostecki, three purposes
underlie the multitudinous and complex articles and agreements of
the GATT: the establishment of non-discrimination, the
prohibition of quantitative restrictions (QRs), and the prevention of
the circumvention of the non-discrimination principle and other
commitments that countries have agreed to abide by. Given the
successes of GATT 1947 in achieving the ﬁrst two goals, many of
the articles and agreements of GATT 1994 provide ways of ensuring
that the successes of the old GATT are not undone through
non-tariff barriers.

included in the new regime. Admittedly, some rumblings of
scepticism were heard at the time of signing the agreements; ten
years after Marrakesh, even former enthusiasts for the agreements
have begun to recognize that developing countries were shortchanged. Below we examine who gave up what in the Grand
Bargain so that the world could get a world trade organization.

World Trade Organization

Tariffs and trade
Tariffs represent a frequently used form of protectionism. Most
economists regard tariffs as a preferable form of trade restriction to
quotas. This is because quotas tend to be arbitrary, sever the link
between domestic and foreign prices, and increase rent-seeking and
corruption in the domestic economy. As a result, GATT 1947 and
1994 devote considerable attention to this subject. Article XI of the
GATT requires a general elimination of quantitative restrictions;
tariffs are permitted. Bernard Hoekman and Michel Kostecki
identify two basic WTO rules for tariffs. First, tariffs must be nondiscriminatory as per the MFN clause that was discussed in the
previous chapter. Second, countries are not allowed to raise tariffs
above the levels that they have committed to in the schedules, that
is, they cannot raise tariffs beyond the ‘tariff binding’. A ‘positive
list’ approach is used in the schedules. This means that bindings
apply only on those speciﬁc products that countries include in their
schedules.
One of the many achievements of the Uruguay Round was to
expand the number of products on which tariffs were bound, and
also the number of countries that took on such bindings. Until the
Uruguay Round, former colonies had acceded to the GATT without
tariff negotiations, while Special and Differential treatment further
exempted them from submitting tariff schedules. The creation of
the WTO completely transformed this, as all WTO members were
required to submit tariff schedules. Developing countries proved
amenable to this change as a result of the Grand Bargain. They were
promised tariff reductions in Northern markets in products in
which developing countries had a comparative advantage. One such
64

issue was agriculture, which had effectively been excluded from
GATT rules in the past. Under GATT 1994, members were obliged
to bind 100% of their agricultural tariff lines. The agreement also
promised an end to the exceptionalism granted to textiles and
clothing through a phase-out of the Multi Fibre Agreement. In
return for these gains, developing countries bound their tariffs.
Hoekman and Kostecki record that prior to the Uruguay Round,
only 22% of industrial products from developing countries were
bound. Post Uruguay Round, this ﬁgure had risen to 72%.
Developed countries, in turn, took their own commitments on
industrial products even further, increasing the share of their bound
industrial tariff lines from 78% to 99%.

Averages of lower tariffs on industrial goods conceal the very high
‘tariff peaks’ that developed countries continue to maintain on
select products, many of which constitute the key export interests of
65

The expanding mandate

A closer look at these tariff bindings, however, reveals several
problems. The increase in tariff bindings taken on by developing
countries was massive, but it did not result in a commensurate level
of actual liberalization. This is because developing countries had
bound their tariffs at levels that were signiﬁcantly higher than their
applied tariffs. As a result, the bindings did not improve market
access within developing countries; their only substantive
achievement was to establish a ceiling, above which the particular
country could not easily raise tariffs without justiﬁcation. These
effectively limited schedules of developing countries have naturally
provoked the ire of countries, practitioners, and theoreticians. The
continued trade restrictions of developing countries appear
especially offensive to some, given that average applied tariff rates
on industrial products have fallen below 3% in developed countries.
Some liberal economists have been quick to argue that developing
countries must engage in some real liberalization now before
demanding any further concessions from the developed world. But
the schedules of the developed countries too, in spite of impressive
averages, are far from perfect.

World Trade Organization

developing countries, such as leather, rubber, and footwear. Textiles
and agriculture, in which several developing countries enjoy an
export advantage, had been effectively excluded from general GATT
rules through exceptions and waivers; one of the main
achievements of the Uruguay Round was the inclusion of these
issues into the WTO. But even though the Multi Fibre Agreement
was scheduled for a complete phase-out by 2005, tariffs of the
developed countries on textiles remained very high. For instance,
US tariffs on about 52% of products in textiles and clothing ranged
from 15 to 35%. Other sectors in which developing countries enjoy a
comparative advantage, such as tropical products and ﬁsh, face
similarly high barriers to market access in developed countries. In
other words, despite the fact that tariff reductions on goods enjoy a
ﬁfty-year legacy from the GATT, the process of multilateral tariff
reduction within WTO auspices remains severely unbalanced
against the weaker players in the international system.
Besides having to contend with tariff peaks that are effectively
permitted in the WTO, developing countries also face the problem
of ‘tariff escalation’, that is tariff structures wherein raw materials
are charged lower duties than processed products. Such tariff
structures create a disincentive against the processing of primary
commodities in developing countries. Though tariff escalation has
declined as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the
problem continues in some of the areas where developing countries
enjoy potential strength and thwarts their economic development.
Similarly, even though quotas were always prohibited in the GATT,
countries managed to ﬁnd devices to use them. Article XI of GATT
1994 disallows quotas, but tariff quotas have proliferated in the key
area of agriculture. As a result of the prevalence of tariff peaks, tariff
escalations, and tariff quotas, developing countries ﬁnd that the
beneﬁts of the Uruguay Round have fallen far short of the estimates
(e.g. through studies conducted by the World Bank and the GATT
Secretariat) when they signed on to the agreements. The unfulﬁlled
promises of the Uruguay Round have attracted considerable
rancour from developing countries and formed a major part of the
66

agenda of coalitions of developing countries at the Seattle and Doha
Ministerial conferences in 1999 and 2001 respectively.

Agriculture and textiles
Nowhere are the problems of unfulﬁlled promises more apparent
than in the area of agriculture and textiles. The inclusion of these
two sectors within GATT 1994 formed the key component of the
deal that was offered to developing countries. However, GATT 1994
does not include these two sectors within its general rules; rather,
they form a part of a set of sector-speciﬁc agreements where the
general rules do not actually apply.

The Cairns Group
The inclusion of agriculture into the Uruguay Round was
historic, and the role of the Cairns Group in brokering the
deal has attracted considerable attention. The Cairns Group
of Agricultural Exporting Countries was formed in 1986,
with an initial membership comprising Argentina, Australia,
67

The expanding mandate

The Agreement on Agriculture was a product of the concerted
efforts of a coalition of developed and developing countries known
as the Cairns Group, besides the ultimate compromise between the
EU and the US (see box). The Agreement targets ‘three pillars’ of
agricultural trade policy: market access, domestic support
mechanisms, and export subsidies. In addition to these
instruments, the agreement also addresses the non-tariff barriers of
arbitrary standards that countries might employ in the Agreement
on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) (discussed later in
this section). Some of these commitments, at ﬁrst glance, appear
quite radical, especially if one also incorporates the transparency
gains that should have emerged as a result of the process of
‘tarifﬁcation’, that is the conversion of quotas and other
protectionist devices into tariffs.

World Trade Organization

Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Uruguay. It differed from many coalitions in the past in that it
was an issue-speciﬁc coalition and combined developed and
developing countries. The group arose in response to the
agricultural subsidies war that had arisen between the EU
and the US, which was eroding the comparative advantage of
middle-income agricultural exporters who could not offer
competing levels of subsidy for their own producers.
Having successfully engineered the inclusion of agriculture
on the agenda of the new round, the group acted as a mediating coalition between the two policy extremes advocated by
the EU and the US. While presenting itself as a negotiating
coalition with a positive agenda (as opposed to blocking
coalitions that developing countries had traditionally
formed), it was also willing to use the threat to block when
necessary. When the Agreement on Agriculture was ﬁnally
included within the Marrakesh Agreement, many observers
attributed this achievement to the negotiating efforts of the
Cairns Group. For almost a decade thereafter, the Cairns
Group was held up as a model coalition, prompting a series
of coalition attempts emulating its ‘issue-based diplomacy’.
These experiments with issue-based coalitions emulating the
Cairns Group generated mixed results. This is because the
Cairns Group was a product of some irreproducible conditions that included the unsustainably costly subsidies war,
which even the EU and the US wanted to bring into control.
Further, the Cairns Group shared its long-term objectives
with the US at the time of the Uruguay Round. Finally, most
analyses focusing on the successes of the Cairns Group
ignore the marginalization of the group in the endgame. The
ﬁnal deal was struck in the Blair House accord between the
US and the EU in 1992, in which the Cairns Group was completely sidelined. Given that the deal on agriculture was
68

ultimately negotiated between the EU and the US, it is not
surprising that the Agreement on Agriculture suffers from
several weaknesses and inadequacies that work to the detriment of developing countries.

The expanding mandate

New export subsides were prohibited by the agreement. To
improve market access, all agricultural tariffs had to be bound. In
certain products where some countries had bound their tariffs at
prohibitively high levels, minimum market access commitments
were ensured by setting Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs). Recall that
quotas are otherwise prohibited in the GATT. But in agriculture, a
certain quota of imports was negotiated as mandatory in areas
where countries had bound tariffs to prohibitively high levels (e.g.
Japan’s tariff policy on rice), so that some imports were allowed
market access at a lower tariff rate. On domestic support
measures (which tend to encourage over-production and thereby
introduce distortions in international markets), an Aggregate
Measure of Support (AMS) was negotiated. The AMS is calculated
using the base years of 1986 to 1988 and is used to assess how
much domestic support countries are providing for the
agricultural sector. It categorizes subsidies into four boxes,
thereby allowing some and completely prohibiting others. This is
because the AMS is not targeted towards all agricultural policy
reform; its purpose is only to address those policies that have a
trade-distorting effect. As per this logic, domestic support
measures in the Red Box are prohibited. The Amber Box
measures are to be cut as per the rates shown in the previous
table. The Green Box allows the use of domestic support measures
such as government-funded research, direct income transfers for
farmers that are not coupled with production, and food security.

World Trade Organization

An additional Blue Box was negotiated as part of the Blair House
deal between the US and the EU, which allowed EU
compensation payments for farmers required to limit production
and US deﬁciency payments. The Agreement also speciﬁed the
cuts that had to be made in export subsidies; new export
subsidies were prohibited. The obligations on developing
countries, particularly Least Developing Countries (LDCs), given
especially the concerns of food-importing countries at the time of
the Uruguay Round negotiations, were considerably weaker than
those that had been placed upon the developed countries. Finally,
it looked like developing countries had got themselves quite a
bargain.
A closer inspection reveals that the liberalization process itself
remained quite conservative. As with manufactures, tariffs were
bound at signiﬁcantly higher levels than the applied rates,
producing the ‘binding overhang.’ As tariff reductions per item had
to meet a minimum of 15%, developed countries could concentrate
reductions in areas of little importance to developing countries and
still meet the required average of 36% overall reduction in six
years. Similarly, as a concession to the EU in the Blair House
accord, it was agreed that the AMS would not be product speciﬁc.
As a result, developed countries were able to meet the required cuts
in domestic support by focusing on areas that were of no major
consequence for developing countries. Agriculture still remains a
signiﬁcantly more protected sector in developed countries than
manufactures. T. Hertel and W. Martin estimate in a study
published in 2000 that the farm policies of developed countries
cause annual welfare losses of US$40 billion for developing
countries. The Agreement on Agriculture did have a ‘built-in
agenda’ that was to be launched in 2000, but agricultural
liberalization remains an acrimonious and fraught process (to be
discussed further in Chapter 6).
The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) has also not
delivered the expected beneﬁts. As a result of the import restrictions
70

by developed countries in this sector, developing countries continue
to incur annual welfare losses of about US$10 billion. The
persistence of such losses might at ﬁrst glance seem surprising,
especially as the ATC stipulated that the system of quotas under the
Multi Fibre Agreement would be phased out in four phases over a
ten-year period. But lack of speciﬁcation on exactly what gets
liberalized when has allowed developed countries to reserve the
liberalization of some of the most important items for developing
countries to the last phase, that is the end of 2004. As a result, many
of the beneﬁts that were supposed to have accrued in the ﬁrst
decade of the WTO, and thereby provide a balance against the costs
that developing countries bore through the inclusion of issues such
as intellectual property rights, investment measures, and services,
have not materialized.

While beneﬁts of GATT 1994 have remained unrealized, the costs of
implementing the agreement have increased with the creation of a
more rigorous and intrusive set of rules. Some of these rules
overlapped with those that dated back to the Tokyo Round and were
devised to address the issue of proliferating non-tariff barriers. But
GATT 1994 bound all members to these rules, in contrast to the
Tokyo Round, which only had voluntary codes on these matters.
Further, the content of these obligatory standards usually conforms
to the standards of the developed countries rather than the
indigenous standards of developing countries. J. Michael Finger
and Philip Schuler thus argue in a World Bank study that the
content of agreements like the customs valuation agreement,
agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to trade (SPS),
and the TRIPs agreement amounts to developed countries saying
to the others, ‘‘Do it my way!’’ These standards are hence often seen
as an imposition from the developed countries, via the WTO. Even
if their economies might beneﬁt from the infrastructural reform
that these agreements require in the long run, developing countries
resent the costs that they incur in their implementation. The
creation of these rules, as a result, has not only expanded the
71

Rules, regulations, and non-tariff barriers

World Trade Organization

mandate of the WTO considerably beyond the structures of the
GATT, but it has also exacerbated North-South antagonisms in the
WTO. It is true that these agreements do allow longer transition
periods to developing countries. However, particularly since the
Seattle Ministerial Conference, developing countries have argued
that the costs of implementation are far higher than the breathing
time that the transition periods allow them to cover.
The agreement on customs valuation in GATT 1994 is an example
of this genre of agreements. The possibility that countries would
apply arbitrary standards on imported goods for customs purposes,
and thereby undo the beneﬁts of tariff reductions with a non-tariff
barrier, was quite high. The customs valuation code was formulated
to address this risk, and was integrated into GATT 1994 to
supersede the vague customs valuation requirements of GATT
1947. The agreement requires members to bring their customs
regulations in line with a set of agreed standards for the valuation of
imports for customs purposes. As the customs administration
procedures of the developed countries are already well established,
developing countries bear the brunt of the reforms. These reform
costs are often very high. For instance, Finger and Schuler provide a
conservative estimate that the costs of implementing the customs
valuation agreement for Jamaica will be US$840,000 (to cover
training costs of $120,000, computing equipment and database
costs of $150,000, and increased stafﬁng costs of $600,000).
The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
(SPS) Measures – that was negotiated as a part of the Agreement on
Agriculture, which falls within GATT 1994 – poses problems
similar to those described in the case of customs valuation. The
agreement was formulated ‘to maintain the sovereign right of any
government to provide the level of health protection it deems
appropriate, but to ensure that these sovereign rights are not
misused for protectionist purposes and do not result in unnecessary
barriers to international trade.’ In principle, this does not amount to
a harmonization of standards; countries are allowed to maintain
72

Not only can agreements like the SPS and TBT be costly to
implement, but their rules intrude into national regulatory regimes,
ethics, consumer choice and cultural habits of people. The dispute
between the US and the EU over the EU’s import ban on beef that
had been treated with hormones proved so trenchant precisely
because it had an impact on the food habits and cultural
preferences of people. The WTO Dispute Settlement Panel and
subsequently the Appellate Body ruled against the ban on the
grounds that it had violated the SPS requirement on scientiﬁc
justiﬁcation of national norms and the use of risk assessment
procedures developed by relevant international organizations.
When the EU announced that it was unable to comply with the
ruling, a WTO arbitration panel authorized retaliation by the US
and subsequently by Canada. The case was seen as symbolic of the
WTO’s intrusive capacity into national preferences and local food
habits.
Another contested area where new intrusions into the domestic
terrain were made by the GATT as a result of the Uruguay Round

The expanding mandate

whatever standards and methods of assessment they prefer. But if it
applies those standards at its borders on incoming goods, the SPS
agreement does require the country to demonstrate their scientiﬁc
basis. As the existing internationally recognized standards are those
that were evolved by developed countries, the burden of proving
that indigenous standards are equally effective is an onerous one for
developing countries. Even if their systems might have been
working effectively and efﬁciently in the past, developing countries
end up investing very large sums of money into modifying their own
standards to bring them in line with those of the developed
countries. For instance, Finger and Schuler record that Argentina
spent over US$80 million to establish greater levels of animal and
plant sanitation; in some cases, the costs of implementation can
exceed the annual development budget of Least Developed
Countries (LDCs). The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT) poses similar difﬁculties for developing countries.

World Trade Organization

was that of Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs). TRIMs
are policies used by governments that require foreign investors to
meet certain performance standards in order to boost their
domestic economies in a particular way. Examples include local
content requirements (whereby investors must use a certain
minimum of domestically produced inputs), export requirements
(multinational enterprises must export a certain proportion of
their produce to improve the balance of payments position of the
country), or technology transfer requirements. Developing
countries had actively resisted their inclusion into the GATT,
claiming that these issues took the GATT outside its original
mandate. As a result of this opposition, the TRIMs agreement did
not go as far as the US would have liked, and developing
countries further won the beneﬁt of longer periods of
implementation. But it did become an integral part of GATT
1994. The agreement disallows measures against foreign investors
and foreign products that are inconsistent with the GATT’s
national treatment obligation and the ban on Quantitative
Restrictions.
Akin to the agreements on SPS, TBT, and the other new issues, the
push for TRIMs came from the developed world. And just as the
SPS and TBT agreements apply Northern standards, the TRIMs
agreement is designed to protect foreign direct investment (mainly
Northern investment) in host countries (predominantly Southern
countries). Even these asymmetries within the WTO agenda would
have been acceptable, if they were balanced by other agreements or
clauses that protected interests in the developing world as per the
Grand Bargain. However, this is seldom the case. For instance, even
though the interests of foreign investors are safeguarded through
the TRIMs, the interests of the host country are not. Hence even
though TRIMs effectively introduces a code of conduct for the host
country towards multinational corporations (MNCs), the idea for a
UN Code on Conduct for Transnational Corporations, which
developing countries had lobbied for, proved to be a non-starter and
was ﬁnally scuttled in 1991.
74

One of the most frequently used (and abused) provisions of the
WTO to suspend MFN obligations is Anti-Dumping (AD).
Dumping is said to occur if ‘a company exports a product at a price
lower than the price it normally charges in its own home market.’
Governments in the WTO are allowed to act against such dumping,
but they must be able to show that dumping is causing or
threatening to cause ‘material injury’ to the competing domestic
industry. The Agreement on Anti-Dumping is a highly abstruse one
and countries are wont to use it far more frequently and easily than
can be justiﬁed in economic or legal terms. While the main users of
AD have traditionally been developed countries, by 1996 developing
countries had overtaken developed ones as initiators of AD
investigations. In contrast, most provisions allowing the temporary
suspension of duties, including emergency safeguard provisions and
CVDs, remain surprisingly under-utilized.
75

The expanding mandate

While the scope and reach of GATT 1994 is considerably more
expansive and intrusive than GATT 1947, this should not be
interpreted to mean that countries are defenceless against the
advancing juggernaut of international regulation. A temporary
suspension of obligations is possible under a variety of provisions
including Anti-Dumping (ADs), Countervailing Duties (CVDs),
Balance of Payments, infant industry protection, emergency
safeguards, and special safeguards that are allowed in agriculture
and textiles. Some of these provisions also existed in the old GATT
but were seldom used. This is because countries, especially large
countries, found it easier to impose the so-called bilaterally
negotiated ‘voluntary export restraints’ (VERs). The achievement
of the WTO was to prohibit VERs and specify the conditions
under which obligations could be legally suspended; the fact that
these agreements could be enforced under the WTO’s Dispute
Settlement Mechanism gave them added teeth. In practice,
however, it has proven difﬁcult to prevent countries – developed
and developing – from abusing some of these provisions and
undermining the concessions that have been so laboriously
negotiated.

World Trade Organization

Two explanations seem plausible for the frequent resort to AD
actions by WTO members. First, AD duties are the easiest to slap on
another country, given especially the abstruse nature of the
agreement and difﬁculties in calculating the extent of dumping; the
other provisions are clearer and are hence less conducive to abuse.
For instance, the emergency safeguards provisions are less easily
used due to the strict criteria for their application and associated
compensation that may be demanded of the country employing the
safeguard; AD actions are easier to employ. Second, the absolute
increase in the use of escape mechanisms to circumvent obligations
may be related to the expanded scope of WTO regulations and their
enforceability. Rather than risk retaliation through rule violation, it
seems likely that countries would resort to any manner of devices to
preemptively claim inability to abide by their commitments. AD
duties provide precisely such a means by claiming that a trading
partner is ‘unfairly’ dumping low-priced products into the domestic
economy. The incentive to resort to such measures was small when
the GATT restricted itself to tariffs on certain goods; but GATT
1994 and accompanying agreements regulate in areas that matter
and on which retaliation will hurt. This raises the bigger question:
has the expansion in the agenda of the WTO also enhanced the
scope for rule circumvention on a scale that might undermine the
entire WTO system? This widening and deepening of the WTO
agenda is evident in the agreements on services and intellectual
property.

The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
The idea of including trade in services within the GATT was ﬁrst
proposed by the US at the GATT’s ministerial conference in 1982.
The push for this inclusion was driven in good measure by the
changing comparative advantage of the developed countries. By
1981, for instance, services had come to comprise about 66% of the
GDP of developed countries and 67% of their employment. It was
inevitable that if the commitment of the developed countries to the
GATT was to be maintained, multilateral trade liberalization under
76

the GATT would have to be extended to areas where the proactive
export interests of the developed countries lay.

The story of the inclusion of the services into the GATT, in its ﬁrst
part at least, is not a heartening one. In the face of the resistance
from many countries, a ‘compromise’ was reached at the 1982
ministerial: a work programme on services was initiated, which
77

The expanding mandate

But the entry of services into the GATT proved difﬁcult. For a treaty
that had dealt entirely with trade in goods, services presented a
qualitatively new issue. The services sector had, in fact, been
traditionally thought of as comprising ‘non-tradables’. It covered a
great diversity of activities and required methods of supply that
differed radically from goods. In several sub-sectors, for instance,
provision of services requires proximity between the seller and
consumer (e.g. coiffure, restaurants and hotel industry), requiring
the movement of consumers (e.g. tourists) or sellers establishing
commercial presence in the host country (foreign direct
investment). Many are tailored to the speciﬁc needs of customers
and lack the level of standardization that is common to goods. Any
liberalization of this sector cannot be conducted through simple
tariff reductions, and requires a modiﬁcation of domestic
regulations on matters that affect the movements of goods, people
and capital. Many developing countries feared that the
international regulation of this crucial services sector would
jeopardize their sovereignty. They were also concerned that the
inclusion of services in the GATT would divert attention from issues
that affected them, such as the proliferation of VERs and non-tariff
barriers. Finally while both developed and developing countries
were unclear about the implications of including services within the
GATT, they recognized that the services sector held the key to the
health of their national economies. Concessions on an area of such
great importance could not be frivolously bartered. The attempt by
the US to introduce services into the GATT agenda immediately
galvanized developing countries into a blocking coalition of over 61
countries.

World Trade Organization

would allow the GATT and its contracting parties to prepare a
technical base for negotiations in this sector. Another similar
‘compromise’, in spite of the long-standing opposition of the
coalition of the G10 (comprising Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India and
Yugoslavia, along with Cuba, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Tanzania and
Peru), was effected at the Punta del Este meeting. A countercoalition had come to support the US agenda, now supported by
other developed countries, and services were included into the
Uruguay Round agenda. Developing countries, however, were able
to obtain the concession that cross-issue linkages would be avoided
through the dual-track mechanism. Yet another ‘compromise’ and
though the negotiations on services continued on a different track
from goods, the General Agreement on Trade in Services was ﬁrmly
integrated within the WTO agreements and within the Single
Undertaking. Still hoping to make the best of future services
negotiations, developing countries attempted to restrict the mode of
supply that dealt with direct commercial presence. They were
unsuccessful in this attempt; their more positive attempts to ensure
that developed countries made some genuine commitments on
imports of services supplied through the movement of labour have
yielded only minimal results so far. In retrospect, given that
developing countries got little of concrete value in textiles and
agriculture, some might argue that they had conceded rather a lot
on services for nothing in return.
In theory, the inclusion of services within the GATS in the WTO
presents a massive jump in the mandate of the organization,
especially as barriers to trade in services can be removed only
through modiﬁcation of domestic regulatory regimes. For instance,
a discussion of minimum standards is inevitable if a country is to
allow an inﬂux of doctors and nurses from another country with a
different education system. In practice, however, the GATS is quite
a limited agreement. In structure the agreement is similar to GATT
1994 and comprises a set of general principles and rules, speciﬁc
commitments that apply to sub-sectors listed in Members’
schedules, and annexes dealing with speciﬁc sectors. Article 1
78

There are four annexes or special agreements attached to GATS:
Movement of Natural Persons, Financial Services,
Telecommunications and Air Transport Services. The ﬁrst of these
annexes has aroused considerable acrimony from developing
countries that enjoy a comparative advantage in the export of
services through Mode 4. Commitments of the developed countries
to the import of services through Mode 4 are few; non-tariff
barriers persist in the form of Economic Needs Tests; while the
Annex on the Movement of Natural Persons further speciﬁes that
79

The expanding mandate

deﬁnes the scope of GATS and its application to all four modes of
supply: cross-border supply (i.e. not requiring the movement of
supplier or consumer), movement of the consumer, commercial
presence, and supply through the temporary movement of natural
persons. Similar to the Agreement on Agriculture in the GATT,
GATS has a Built-In Agenda for successive negotiations. It
resembles the GATT in its reliance on non-discrimination as its ﬁrst
and foremost principle. But due to the preference of the EU and
developing countries for an agreement with softer obligations,
non-discrimination in the GATS is more circumscribed than
non-discrimination in the GATT. MFN is a general obligation
(Article II), but members are allowed to list MFN exemptions.
National treatment (Article XVII) is a speciﬁc obligation rather
than a general one, which means that it applies to only those
services speciﬁed in Members’ schedules as per the listed
qualiﬁcations. Governments remain free to set standards and
qualiﬁcation requirements, so long as the same regulations apply to
foreign suppliers as national ones. GATS also contains a market
access obligation (Article XVI), which in principle disallows six
kinds of market access restrictions, though countries can list
speciﬁc restrictions within these categories in particular sectors if
they so wish. Unlike other international agreements like the North
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, most obligations in the GATS
operate through a ‘positive list’. This means that disciplines apply
only in the speciﬁc areas and extent made by each individual
member.

World Trade Organization

GATS deals only with the temporary movement of people rather
than immigration. The inadequacy of commitments in this Annex is
now widely recognized, and at least some of the concerns of
developing countries have been carried over into the current round
of trade negotiations, addressed in Chapter 6. Financial services
and telecommunications were included in separate annexes in the
GATS. This was mainly because the US was dissatisﬁed with the
concessions that other countries had made in these areas; the
deadlines for completing these negotiations were thus postponed
beyond the Marrakesh deadline. Having separate annexes on these
sectors further provided a way of ensuring sectoral reciprocity in
these key areas. Negotiations in ﬁnancial services and
telecommunications were completed by December 1997 and
February 1997 respectively.
While the inclusion of services within the GATT agenda may have
been a contested process initially, several developing countries
have now begun to realize their potential as exporters of services.
The re-location of call centres from Western Europe to developing
countries like India is one example; the emergence of India as a
major exporter of software is another. Further, developing
countries have also begun to play an active and successful role as
agenda-setters in the GATS. For instance, in the ﬁrst phase of the
Built-In Agenda, members were required to collectively formulate a
set of guidelines and procedures for subsequent negotiations by
2001. A coalition of twenty-four developing countries was formed
in 1999 to this end, and successfully shaped the Guidelines that
have formed the basis for the current negotiations.

The Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPs)
Besides GATS, the agreement on TRIPs was negotiated and
signed at Marrkakesh. The inclusion and subsequent negotiation
of TRIPs proved to be even more controversial than services, not
least because it caught up popular imagination at an unprecedented
80

level. The reason for this was partly that TRIPs required
governments to modify their national legislation on patents,
copyrights, and trademarks to bring them in line with the new
agreement. But more importantly, the agreement applied to such
basic and everyday necessities as medicines, and its application
would affect the access of national populations to life-saving drugs
and technologies. Ten years since it was signed, as countries and
their populations begin to understand the nature of obligations that
TRIPs demands, controversies and anger surrounding the
agreement have not abated.

Despite the existence of a network of arrangements to manage
IPRs, the US and EU began to be increasingly concerned that their
comparative advantage as exporters of intellectual property was
being undermined by cheap counterfeits. The US attempts to
include TRIPs within the purview of the GATT go back to the Tokyo
Round. Developing countries, however, were opposed to this idea.
They argued that any changes to international rules on IPRs should
be conducted within an organization whose mandate was devoted
exclusively to such issues, that is the WIPO. This opposition from
developing countries was unsurprising, given that they were largely
importers of IPRs and their IPR protection regimes were often
81

The expanding mandate

The idea of strengthening international legislation on intellectual
property rights pre-dates the Uruguay Round. Most countries
recognized that the provision of intellectual property in many of its
forms (ideas, inventions, discoveries) suffers from a public goods
problem, that is it is difﬁcult to exclude those who did not bear the
costs from beneﬁting from the rewards of production. The risk of
free-riding would act as a deterrent to many crucial inventions and
innovations. As a result, governments have always had some system
of protecting intellectual property rights at home. Internationally,
the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which has
traditionally administered the many treaties that deal with different
aspects of intellectual property rights (IPRs), was established in
1967.

World Trade Organization

weak. Their scepticism about including TRIPs within the GATT
also found support in some economic and social arguments. Ann
Capling, for instance, points out that many countries (including
developed countries until recently) have afforded only weak patent
protection for pharmaceuticals on the grounds that patent
protection will inﬂate the prices of essential drugs. She further
presents the case that ‘Patent owners may place onerous conditions
on the use of new technology, or may simply refuse to license new
technology in order to preserve their monopolistic position,’ thereby
actually slowing ‘the dissemination of new ideas, basic knowledge,
and technological advancement’ rather than encouraging them.
That TRIPs was nonetheless included on the agenda of the Uruguay
Round, and subsequently as an integral part of the WTO demands
an explanation.
Besides the fact that the interests of the developed world (and their
companies) were pushing for an expansion of the GATT in the
direction of the ‘new issues’, three reasons help explain the
inclusion of TRIPs in the WTO. First, by the late 1980s,
concurrently with the negotiations, the US had begun to impose
unilateral trade sanctions on developing countries for violating US
patent law. The most dreaded of these was the Special 301 section of
the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, by which the
US Trade Representative would place countries with objectionable
IPR regimes (e.g. Brazil and India, among others) on its ‘‘priority
watch-list’ and threaten them with unilateral trade sanctions. Faced
with such threats, developing countries began to re-consider their
opposition: including TRIPs within the multilateral system
provided the possibility of curbing the ‘aggressive unilateralism’ of
the US. Second, TRIPs formed a part of the Grand Bargain and
developing countries were offered concessions in other issue-areas.
But third, at least some developing country negotiators have
revealed in subsequent interviews that the technicalities of TRIPs
had evaded them at the time when the agreement was being
negotiated. Rather, they had believed that the TRIPs agreement
would be limited to counterfeit goods.
82

The Agreement that actually resulted at the end of the Uruguay
Round was a highly complex one, comprising seven major parts and
73 articles. It extends to copyrights, trademarks, geographical
indications, industrial designs, patents, lay-out designs of
integrated circuits, and undisclosed information including trade
secrets. The Agreement is based on the same principles of
transparency and non-discrimination as the GATT, but further
establishes minimum standards that countries must abide by in all
the seven areas of IPRs. Most of these standards, akin to the
standards set through the GATT, are based on the interests of
developed countries. Developing countries were granted some
concessions in the form of longer periods for implementation.
However, these concessions have proved to be inadequate, given the
costs of implementation that developing countries face. A few
safeguards have been built into the TRIPs such as Article 8 on the
83

9. The inclusion of TRIPs into the GATT was a new development.
Developing countries had not anticipated that the new agreement that
was being negotiated under the auspices of the GATT would extend
beyond the issue of counterfeits.

World Trade Organization

right of governments to protect public health and even override
patents if need be. In practice, developing countries have found it
extremely difﬁcult to make use of these safeguards. Some of the
problems with the TRIPs agreement, particularly the costs of
implementation of the agreement and its provisions on patents,
were brought to the fore by developing countries and nongovernmental organizations in the run-up to the Doha Ministerial
Conference in 2001, and will be covered in Chapter 6.
All the agreements discussed in this chapter provide an insight
into the expansive and complicated network of rules that comprise
the WTO. The process of including new issues into the WTO
continues unabated. There is a new round of trade negotiations
currently underway, known as the Doha Development Agenda,
which will address some of the problems associated with the
current agreements but will inevitably take the WTO into newer
terrain.
The widening and deepening of the reach of the WTO has not gone
uncontested. Most of the agreements, arrived at through difﬁcult
compromise, have had to rely on ambiguities and inconsistencies to
make the agreement palatable to all parties concerned. These
political discrepancies within the agreements often carry over into
the Dispute Settlement Mechanism and require legal resolution. In
the next chapter, I examine the legal system that underpins the
WTO as an international organization.

84

Chapter 5
Settling disputes

Many negotiators and scholars agree that while the achievements
of the Uruguay Round negotiations were many, the jewel in the
crown of these achievements is the powerful Dispute Settlement
Understanding (DSU). The emergence of this powerful mechanism
imparts an unprecedented level of legalization to the WTO. In a
project on ‘Legalization and International Politics’, scholars led by
Judith Goldstein, Miles Kahler, Robert Keohane, and Anne-Marie
Slaughter analyse the concept of legalization across three key
dimensions: obligation, precision, and delegation. In all three, the
WTO is an exemplar. Its members are obliged to abide by its rules
or face retaliation; its rules are precise and determine what may be
expected of its members; and in the instance of disputes, members
delegate the authority to settle these disputes to a Dispute
Settlement Panel, an Appellate Body, and ultimately the Dispute
Settlement Body. Through the DSU, the WTO has acquired teeth;
its rules can be enforced with an automacity and with consequences
that were quite alien to the GATT. These are major developments
with system-wide consequences. They have deprived developed
countries (particularly the US) of the excuse that the inadequacies
and poor enforcement capacity of the GATT compelled them to
resort to unilateral and bilateral measures. They have also imparted
greater certainty and predictability to the international trading
system, which are particularly valued by developing countries.
In this chapter, I examine dispute settlement within the WTO by
85

World Trade Organization

focusing on its procedures and some of its landmark cases. As WTO
law evolves, so does the legalism of the organization. But this
chapter highlights two fundamental problems with this trend
towards increasing legalization. First, the newfound legalism of
WTO rules contrasts with the ad hoc and informal processes that
actually create those rules (as discussed in Chapter 3). The
disjuncture between the informal rule-making procedures of the
WTO and the highly legal implementation of those rules underpins
the challenges that the organization is facing from different fronts
today. The WTO system risks an implosion if these discrepancies
are not corrected. Second, despite their preference for a stronger
rules-based system (which the DSU facilitates), developing
countries in practice ﬁnd themselves ill equipped to utilize this
system to their advantage. In the context of these difﬁculties, the
sustainability of the WTO system in its current form becomes even
more suspect.

Dispute settlement in the WTO
Article XVI:1 of the Agreement establishing the WTO states that
the WTO shall be guided by the ‘decisions, procedures and
customary practices’ followed by GATT 1947. Despite this attempt
to maintain a link with its predecessor, the DSU under the WTO
presents a departure from the GATT in several important ways.
First, the DSU establishes a single uniﬁed dispute settlement
system under the WTO, in contrast to the multiple dispute
settlement procedures that came with the codes of the Tokyo
Round. Exceptions to this are clearly listed in Annex 2.
Second, and very importantly, a considerable degree of automaticity
has been introduced in the process that was non-existent in the
GATT. This is because dispute settlement under the GATT worked
on the principle of ‘positive consensus’, that is, any member –
including the parties to the dispute – could initially block the
establishment of a Panel or the subsequent adoption of the Panel
86

Report. In contrast, dispute settlement in the WTO works on the
principle of ‘negative consensus’. This means that after parties have
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve their dispute through
consultation, unless the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) – the
General Council by another name and comprising the entire
membership of the WTO – decides by consensus not to allow the
establishment of a Panel (Article VI) or to reject its decision (Article
XVII:14), the Panel will be established. Similarly, a decision by the
Panel (or the Appellate Body) requires consensus to be rejected.
Panels are constituted by three or ﬁve ‘well-qualiﬁed governmental
and/or non-governmental individuals’ (Article 8) drawn from a
roster of potential panelists who are nominated by WTO members.
The DSU provides clear terms of reference for the Panel on its
modus operandi.

Fourth, the DSU provides for improved surveillance mechanisms
for the implementation of DSB decisions that were virtually
non-existent in the GATT. If the offending country fails to adopt
corrective measures ‘within a reasonable period of time’, Article
XXII.2 of the DSU requires the disputing parties to negotiate
compensation for the aggrieved party. In the absence of agreement
on this compensation, the DSB can authorize retaliation. The only
way the DSB can reject this authorization is through consensus.
Finally, all the provisions of the DSU come with clearly speciﬁed
time-frames for each stage (outlined in the ﬂowchart). In the GATT,
87

Settling disputes

Third, the DSU establishes an appellate procedure in the WTO that
did not exist in the GATT. John Jackson explains the introduction
of the appellate procedure as a quid pro quo that was exchanged for
the automaticity, through the negative consensus requirement, in
the adoption of Panel decisions. The Appellate Body deals only with
issues such as legal interpretation; it cannot re-examine the
evidence or address new issues. The report of the Appellate Body is
ﬁnal, and must be adopted by the DSB unless a negative consensus
prevails.

3. Stages in the dispute settlement process

88

cases could be indeﬁnitely dragged out among the disputants,
involving considerable costs for the aggrieved parties. These costs
were of particular concern for developing countries, which
remained wary of bringing disputes to the GATT even when there
was a very high probability of the decision eventually turning out to
be in their favour. In the WTO, not only are deﬁnite time limits
attached to each stage of the dispute settlement process, but the
process can be expedited if it involves perishable products and
if developing countries are involved as complainants against
developed countries.

The TPRM has three goals. First, it attempts to ensure the
transparency of Members’ trade policies through regular
monitoring. Second, it attempts to improve the quality of public and
intergovernmental debate on the issues. Finally, it seeks to enable a
multilateral assessment of the effects of policies on the world
trading system. Each review comprises two documents – one
89

Settling disputes

While the DSU under the WTO is a considerably stronger
instrument than the dispute settlement process of the GATT,
the onus of employing this instrument falls on the members
themselves. This is in keeping with the WTO’s member-driven
character and derives also from its GATT legacy. Member states
need to exercise constant vigilance on how their interests are being
affected by the trade policies of other members, as well as domestic
awareness of WTO rules by companies and consumers who might
be affected by rule violations. The rules of the WTO provide some
assistance in the exercise of this vigilance through the requirement
that all members publish their trade regulations, notify changes to
the WTO, and respond to any requests by members for further
information. Additionally, the WTO conducts periodic Trade Policy
Reviews. Detailed provisions about the Trade Policy Review
Mechanism (TPRM), which forms an integral part of the WTO,
are listed in Annex 3. The top body for this exercise is the Trade
Policy Review Body – the General Council by yet another name –
but the Secretariat is responsible for conducting the reviews.

World Trade Organization

prepared by the government concerned, and the other prepared by
the WTO Trade Policies Review division. Countries with the
largest trade shares are subject to the most frequent reviews, for
example the Quad group (Canada, EU, Japan, and US) are
reviewed every two years; the next 16 countries (in terms of shares
of world trade) are reviewed every four years; while the Least
Developed Countries (LDCs) enjoy much longer time periods
(sometimes more than six years) between each review. Even a
damning Trade Policy Review by the Secretariat, however, is not
enough to initiate action by the Dispute Settlement Body. Only if a
member state formally lodges a complaint can the dispute
settlement process be initiated.
Members can bring three kinds of complaints to the DSM, which
are highlighted in Article XXIII of GATT 1994, and elaborated on
in the Annex on Dispute Settlement. First, if there is a breach of
rules by any one member, which is brought to the attention of the
DSB by another member, there is a prima facie case for a
‘nulliﬁcation and impairment’ of the beneﬁts that were meant to
accrue for the aggrieved party. There are numerous examples of
such cases that allege rule violation. Bernard Hoekman and Michel
Kostecki point out that the largest share of cases involves
allegations that the principles of non-discrimination have been
violated. Second, a member can also advance a ‘non-violation’
complaint. This means that a member can ﬁle a complaint if it
considers that any beneﬁt of an agreement under the WTO is being
nulliﬁed or impaired ‘as a result of the application by a Member of
any measure, whether or not it conﬂicts with the provisions of that
Agreement’. The third kind of complaint is a ‘situation’ complaint.
Under this provision, even if the complaint does not ﬁt into the ﬁrst
two categories, if the member feels that its gains from a WTO
agreement are being undermined by ‘any other situation’, it can ﬁle
a complaint against the offending country. All these different
provisions point to a legal system that goes beyond the narrow
interpretation of the letter of the law and instead encompasses the
spirit of the WTO agreements. If consultations between the
90

disputants do not yield results in 60 days, complaints in any of the
three categories automatically trigger the establishment of the
panel and subsequent stages. If the respondent fails to comply
with the recommendations of the DSB, retaliation can be
authorized.

All these developments indicate a considerable transformation of
the dispute settlement system from its GATT days. In tandem with
91

Settling disputes

Retaliation involves raising duties against the respondent, with
variations on the subjects to be covered that depend on the
peculiarities of each case and the parties involved. For instance, in
the dispute on the EU bananas regime (Ecuador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Mexico, and the US versus the EU, wherein the
complainants contested the import quotas that the EU allocated for
the African Caribbean and Paciﬁc – ACP – group of countries; the
panel ruled in favour of the complainants), the provisions for
retaliation granted to the US included the ‘carousel approach’. As
per this approach, retaliatory tariffs of 100% were imposed on a
different set of EU exports in every six-month period, thereby
hurting the EU in a diversity of sectors. The same dispute
also became the ﬁrst, and therefore landmark, case in which
cross-retaliaton was authorized. Having won the case, Ecuador had
pointed out that its imports from the EU were too small to allow
full retaliation (which had been set at $200 million). Instead, it
sought and won the right to cross-retaliate by suspending its
concessions under other agreements, including TRIPs. It is worth
noting that compensation payments are usually not included as
part of the redress mechanism. This reluctance to include
compensation payments derives partly from GATT precedent,
where, except for one case in 1981 (wherein New Zealand issued a
refund to Finland), compensation payments were not accepted.
The only case in which compensation has been accepted in the
WTO was between the US and Australia in 2000, wherein the
beneﬁciary of an illegal export subsidy was required to reimburse
the funds.

World Trade Organization

its increased legal component, however, the DSU has managed to
retain the political basis of the agreement. It is the members
themselves who nominate potential panellists whose names are put
onto the roster, and the approval of the disputants is required on the
composition of each dispute settlement panel. And even though the
responsibility of settling legal issues lies with the appointed panels,
the ultimate dispute settlement body is the DSB, which is
constituted by the entire membership of the WTO. Admittedly, in
practice, it is almost impossible for the DSB to reject a Panel or
Appellate Body decision, given the requirement of negative
consensus. But the retention of this political authorization, however
perfunctory it might appear, is important, and provides an
important insight into the difﬁcult balance that the WTO attempts
to tread between the political and the legal. We explore the resulting
contradictions in our next section.

The politics of legalization
Legalization, in principle, epitomizes a rules-based trading system.
But the impact of this legalization on outcomes is impossible to
determine without taking two factors into account: the institutional
context within which legalization takes place, and the political
processes that give it substance and direction.
While the preceding section illustrated the automatic and binding
character of WTO rules, which are enforced via the long arm
of its law, this legality sits uncomfortably against the informal
rule-making processes that were discussed in Chapter 3. The DSU
treats decisions, arrived at through arbitrary processes, as legally
binding and can enforce the resulting agreements with stringency.
This incongruity, between its powerful legal system of rules and the
poorly institutionalized decision-making processes that actually go
into the making of that system is a serious one. Its biggest cost is for
developing countries, which ﬁnd themselves legally bound to a
system of rules that is not one of their making, but one that they
must nonetheless abide by or risk retaliation.
92

93

Settling disputes

The costs of legalization are rendered doubly high because of the
reach of the WTO. In Chapter 4, we analysed the controversial
extension of the mandate of the WTO into areas of regulation that
take it well inside the state borders and areas that have traditionally
fallen within domestic jurisdiction. Legalization means that
countries must adhere to contested WTO rules, sometimes even
when this entails changing domestic laws. The case that we had
discussed as an example of the de facto expansion in the WTO’s
mandate was the US/EU dispute on beef hormones. The WTO’s
ruling in favour of the US and against the EU ban on the import of
hormone-treated beef was seen, in many sectors, as the intrusion of
WTO law into the cultural traditions and basic food habits of
peoples. Another similar case was the shrimp-turtles dispute, which
was brought to the DSB by India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand
in 1997 against the US. In response to domestic concern about the
preservation of turtles – an endangered species – and pressure from
the ﬁshing industry regarding protection from unfair competition,
the US prohibited the shrimp imports from countries that did not
use turtle exclusion devices in their shrimp nets. The US defended
its import ban by invoking Article XXg of the GATT, which allows
trade-restrictive measures for the ‘conservation of exhaustible
natural resources’. The Panel ruled against the US by focusing on
the requirement by Article XX that the measure must not
constitute a ‘disguised restriction on trade’. But the Appellate Body
reversed the ruling on the grounds that the US ban was covered by
Article XXg, even though it agreed with the Panel that the ban had
resulted in unjustiﬁable discrimination (as the US had not given the
targeted countries adequate time to comply with its requirements).
Despite the reprimand to the US, the ruling attracted considerable
controversy. It was seen as yet another instance of how some
countries could impose their national norms on other members.
Further, the case was seen as setting a dangerous precedent that
would allow countries to apply even those production process
standards that did not affect the physical characteristics of the
product, going considerably beyond what was allowed under
WTO rules.

World Trade Organization

The issue of precedent and the expansion of WTO law take us into
the second set of problems with the DSU, namely the process of
legalization itself. International trade lawyer John Jackson points
out that in international law, stare decisis, or the common law
concept of precedent, does not apply. In practice, however,
reference to precedent was frequently used in the dispute
settlement process in the GATT, including the formal dispute
settlement panel ﬁndings. The same remains true of the DSU under
the WTO, and in fact permeates even other aspects of institutional
process such as decision-making procedures. Rulings become part
of the ‘practice’ – if not formal precedent – under the agreement and
inﬂuence subsequent decisions of the panels and the Appellate
Body. Gregory Shaffer thus writes, ‘Individual WTO cases involve
more than the judicial resolution of an individual dispute. WTO
panel and Appellate Body decisions also produce systemic effects
for future cases.’ This becomes a problem when developing
countries are involved. Those governments that are active
participants in the DSM can effectively shape WTO law to their
advantage. Such governments are seldom from developing
countries, as illustrated in the next section.
In addition to the above, the de facto tendency of the Appellate Body
to engage in far-reaching interpretation, precedent-creation, and
jurisprudence is also problematic. Aspects of contested issues on
which negotiations have proven difﬁcult have been brought to the
DSB for adjudication. Once the DSB has made a pronouncement on
such an area, contested rules that had never been agreed upon
manage to make a legal, backdoor entry into the WTO. Given the
intrusive scope of WTO rules, it is particularly important that they
are carefully negotiated, and countries are fully aware of what they
are signing up to and its implications. By effectively substituting
negotiation with adjudication, the WTO runs the risk of
undermining the legitimacy and longer-term sustainability of its
agreements.

94

Developing countries in the dispute settlement
process

A closer look at the numbers reveals a less optimistic picture. In a
seminal study, Eric Reinhardt and Marc Busch ﬁnd that developing
countries ‘are one-third less likely to ﬁle complaints against
developed states under the WTO than they were under the
post-1989 GATT regime’. In contrast, the likelihood of a developing
country being the target of a complaint has increased ﬁvefold.
Shaffer further notes that developing countries made scarce use of
the WTO provision that allows countries to register as third parties
to disputes. Only Brazil, India, and Mexico were third parties to
more than 8 of the ﬁrst 273 cases of the WTO, whereas the EU had
acted as third party 41 times, and the US 32 times, by August 2002.
These ﬁgures suggest that as far as a proactive involvement in the
dispute settlement process is concerned, developing countries stand
at the periphery. This marginalization is costly and entails longterm consequences: WTO law, still in a state of evolution, is being
shaped by developed countries to their advantage, as developing
countries stand watching on the sidelines.
95

Settling disputes

At face value, despite the problems highlighted in the previous
section, the dispute settlement system seems to have been a success.
Hoekman and Kostecki, for instance, point out that over 160
requests were brought to the WTO from 1995 to 2000, which
amounted to three times more on a per annum basis than under the
GATT. The involvement of developing countries also recorded an
increase: over 30% of all the cases involved developing countries as
complainants or defendants. Most cases, moreover, tend to produce
compliance; the actual use of retaliation has been necessary in only
two cases to date. The successes of the dispute settlement system
are further borne out in not just the cases that are brought to the
panel, but also cases that are settled in the consultation phase.
It could be argued that consultation under ‘the shadow of law’
pre-empts countries from escalating disputes to a point when they
can only be resolved through the establishment of a panel.

World Trade Organization

The marginalization of developing countries from the dispute
settlement process has several explanations. First, the costs of
access to the dispute settlement mechanism are extremely high.
Given the extreme technicalities of each case and the tomes of
jurisprudence that have accumulated over the years, specialized
legal knowledge is essential for effective participation. However,
indigenous legal expertise on the WTO is scarce, and the costs of
hiring private lawyers are prohibitively high. Shaffer, for instance,
records that even for a relatively small case, a law ﬁrm cited a fee
of £200,000 for representing a developing country until the panel
stage. In high-proﬁle cases, such as the Kodak versus Fuji of
Japan-Photographic ﬁlm case, lawyers charged each of their clients
a sum of over $10 million. It is difﬁcult, if not impossible, for
developing countries to produce comparable ﬁnancial resources.
Second, when developing countries do get involved in certain cases
that are of critical and unavoidable importance to them, they enter
the dispute settlement process as ‘one-off’ players rather than
‘repeat’ players. These one-off initiatives, Shaffer points out, tend to
be ﬁnanced by industry or developed countries and usually address
the particular cases rather than the long-term, systemic interests of
the country. Herein also lies a vicious circle: lack of participation on
a sustained basis and without an eye on systemic concerns renders
the cost of one-off participation even higher, increasing thereby
the reluctance of developing countries to bring their grievances
to the DSB.
Third, given the member-driven character of the WTO, the onus of
presenting a case lies on the members themselves. This is difﬁcult,
not only in terms of the costs involved and locking in of resources
until a ruling is made, but also the risk that the stronger party might
decide to retaliate against the weaker complainant through
unilateral punitive actions outside the WTO. Few developing
countries can afford to take on such a risk.
Fourth, in those instances wherein developing countries decide to
96

As a result of these imbalances within the dispute settlement
system, important in terms of individual cases but also because of
the long-term implications of particular rulings on WTO
jurisprudence, some steps have been taken. An important step is the
establishment of the WTO Advisory Centre on WTO law, which has
been set up precisely to provide affordable advice to developing
countries. In addition to this, several proposals for reform have also
been put forward. The agenda for re-examining the dispute
settlement process forms part of the Doha Development Agenda – a
new round of trade negotiations that is currently underway
(discussed in Chapter 6). Reform proposals have shown a divide
between developed and developing countries. Developing
countries, in general, have called for longer time periods,
consultations in the capitals of LDCs to cut costs of travel to
Geneva, greater role for the WTO Advisory Centre, and the right of
collective retaliation and trade compensation. Developed countries,
on the other hand, have shown a preference for shorter time
periods, greater public access, stronger surveillance mechanisms,
97

launch a complaint and win, enforcement of the rulings of the WTO
relies on trade retaliation rather than monetary compensation.
Small, developing economies seldom have the means to enforce
compliance through trade sanctions due to their smaller shares in
world trade. To take a hypothetical example, assume that weak
Country A were to win a case against a Quad Country B, and were
allowed to impose higher tariffs on certain sectors of imports from
Country B. But such tariffs would scarcely make a dent on Country
B’s economy, given that the market of Country A constitutes a
minuscule share of B’s exports. On the other hand, several sectors
within Country A might incur large costs, especially if it is the
primary supplier of a particular product. Knowledge of the costs of
retaliation would make Country A reluctant to ﬁle a dispute in the
WTO, even if it would be very likely to win; rather, it would prefer to
settle the matter outside the institution. This reluctance of the
weaker countries is borne out empirically: no LDC has been
involved as either a complainant or a defendant in a dispute to date.

World Trade Organization

and weaker retaliation processes. These debates, however, have
shown little sign of resolution so far. This is partly because there is
little agreement in the research or policy communities on what
prompts compliance in the ﬁrst place. While some scholars have
emphasized the importance of retaliation or at least the credible
threat of retaliation, others have pointed out that compliance with
any norms or rules in international institutions is a product of
socialization, learning, and reputation. In the meantime, the
agenda of the WTO and the reach of its dispute settlement
mechanism continue to expand in several inchoate directions.

98

Chapter 6
The Doha
Development Agenda

The previous chapters highlighted some of the controversies that
have dogged the WTO since its inception, and others that have
developed as the WTO itself evolves. Amidst these controversies,
the ﬁrst round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) under the
auspices of the WTO – known as the Doha Development Agenda
(DDA) – was launched in November 2001. At this stage, it is
difﬁcult to predict exactly how this round will conclude, but two
things are certain. First, around the successful conclusion of the
round hang not just the interests of particular countries but the very
credibility of the WTO as an international organization. The
rumblings of discontent targeted at the GATT have grown to a
crescendo in the ﬁrst decade of the WTO, the Uruguay Round is
seen to have failed developing countries, and two of the ﬁve
ministerial meetings of the WTO have come crashing down in
failure. Disillusionment with the organization is very high;
countries have begun to resort to a plethora of bilateral and regional
agreements that threaten any meaningful existence of the WTO and
often also further undermine the position of the weak. The Doha
Development Agenda, as its name indicates, is at least as much an
attempt to correct the problems that developing countries and their
peoples have encountered as it is an effort to expand the coverage of
the agreements. This time, given the history of disappointment and
disenfranchisement that comes with it, the WTO cannot afford to
fail. Second, the scheduled deadline for the completion of the DDA
of January 2005 has proven remarkably ambitious and unrealistic;
99

all negotiators, politicians and analysts today recognize that
negotiations will be more complex, arduous and protracted than
they had anticipated. In this chapter, I explore the launching of the
DDA (including a brief overview of the failed Seattle Ministerial
where the attempt to launch the new round was ﬁrst made). I
review the content and progress of the DDA so far, which offer us
some important insights into the new dynamics of WTO
negotiations.

World Trade Organization

The false start to a new round: Seattle Ministerial,
1999
Though the DDA was launched at the fourth ministerial conference
of the WTO at Doha in November 2001, the very foundations of the
DDA lay in a history of acrimony that was fully borne out in the
failed Seattle Ministerial Conference of November 1999.
Negotiators had hoped to launch a new development-friendly trade
round at Seattle, but the conference itself had ended in a dramatic
debacle amidst demonstrations by Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs). Demonstrators – most non-violent, some
anarchist – turned up in the thousands (estimates vary from 30,000
to 60,000) on the streets of Seattle to protest against the WTO. This
scale of public outrage came as some surprise for international
bureaucrats and negotiators, not least because the abstruse and
technical content of trade negotiations had traditionally shielded
the GATT and its successor from direct public scrutiny. The
perceived democratic deﬁcit of the WTO underlay this outrage; I
explore the sources of the perceived democratic deﬁcit of the WTO
in the next chapter.
While certain stakeholders in the WTO process tend to view the
failure of the Seattle Ministerial as a direct result of the power of
NGOs, it is extremely doubtful if a new round could have been
launched even if no popular discontent had been expressed. In the
run-up to the meeting, the central preoccupation of all members
had been the selection of a new Director General to succeed Renato
100

Ruggiero, which took time and effort away from the necessary
preparations for Seattle. Disagreements among the member
countries over the launch of the Millennium Round were many and
bitter. The push for the launch of a new round came primarily from
developed countries who believed that new gains were to be made
by expanding the agenda of the WTO beyond the mandate of the
existing agreements. The EU had been pushing for the inclusion of
the Singapore issues since 1996 (recall that the Singapore issues
encompassed competition policy, investment, transparency in
government procurement and trade facilitation). The US and
Canada had wanted to improve transparency in the Dispute
Settlement Mechanism; the US under the Clinton administration
also introduced a last-minute proposal at the Seattle conference
that a working party on trade and labour be created in the WTO.
Developing countries baulked at almost all the proposals put forth by
the developed countries. The issue of labour standard had been
acrimoniously debated at the Singapore Ministerial in 1996, with
the agreement that matters relating to this controversial issue
would be addressed by the International Labour Organization and
101

The Doha Development Agenda

World Trade Organization

not the WTO. The US decision to re-open the matter at Seattle was
seen as a slap in the face of developing countries. The position of
developing countries was simple: until the so-called
‘implementation issues’ were addressed, there could be no
discussion of a new round. Implementation issues referred to the
undelivered promises of Uruguay Round and the huge,
unanticipated costs of implementing the commitments that they
had taken on as part of the agreement. Each party adhered ﬁrmly to
its position at the Seattle Ministerial and refused to engage in any
compromise.
Opaque procedures of functioning, discussed in Chapter 3, further
exacerbated antagonisms. Statements by the Chair reinforced
developed-developing country differences and did little to enhance
the democratic underpinnings of the WTO. For instance, US Trade
Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, stated openly that if the
process did not reach a consensus text, ‘I fully reserve the right to
use a more exclusive process to achieve a ﬁnal outcome. There is no
question about either my right as the chair to do it or my intention
as the chair to do it.’ Developing countries rose back in anger; the
meeting ended in failure.

The Doha Development Agenda: Doha Ministerial,
2001
Few of these priorities had changed as the Doha Ministerial
approached. Nevertheless, the decision to launch the Doha
Development Agenda was arrived at the Doha Ministerial
Conference in November 2001. Consensus on the same subject that
had proved so problematic only two years ago was a product of
three factors. First, partly in response to the debacle at Seattle, and
especially as a reaction to the tragic events of 9/11, many countries
were coming around to the view that a major gesture was needed to
preserve the last vestiges of multilateral cooperation. Second, in the
aftermath of Seattle, a conscious attempt had been made to improve
at least some of the decision-making processes leading up to the
102

Ministerial Conference, some of which were discussed in Chapter 3.
The WTO also began to improve its external transparency with
improved information availability for NGOs. But third, many of the
coalitions of developing countries broke ranks in the endgame at
Doha as their member countries were bought off through various
bilateral deals. Aileen Kwa provides an interesting account of the
various carrots and sticks that were used in the run-up to Doha and
at the ministerial itself to break the opposition of developing
countries. The box below focuses speciﬁcally on one speciﬁc
coalition – the Like-Minded Group – and how the coalition was
‘won over’ to the ‘compromise’ at Doha.

The LMG was formed in 1996 and originally comprised
Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. By the time of the Doha Ministerial, it had
expanded to 14 members. It maintained a vehement opposition to any new negotiations in the WTO until the implementation issues were addressed, and presented detailed,
technical papers on several speciﬁc issues. The group offered
few concessions to the developed world in return.
Recognizing the very high costs of giving in to the demands of
the LMG, the Quad began to offer concessions that were targeted towards speciﬁc countries within the coalition. Some
responded. The African countries accepted the TRIPs and
public health declaration and a WTO waiver for the African
Caribbean Paciﬁc (ACP) group with the EC. In return, they
dropped their opposition to negotiations over industrial tariffs, the environment, and Singapore issues. Promises of
assistance for capacity-building and development aid packages were important for the weakest members of the group.

Simultaneously, various sticks were brandished. Developing
countries were told that the ACP waiver and the TRIPs and
public health declaration would be withdrawn. Smaller
countries were warned that their preferences would be withdrawn. Ministers were told to either recall recalcitrant
ambassadors or ensure that the ambassador softened his
position. After Doha, three ambassadors from the LMG are
alleged to have been recalled from Geneva because of their
hard line.
Once the process of fragmentation had begun, it generated a
domino effect. One LMG ambassador explained: ‘Once it
became evident to the other countries that some were falling
off, then they had to consider if it was politically prudent for
them to take up a stance of resistance.’ On 14 November
2001, India stood alone at the vanguard of resistance; the
Doha Development Agenda was launched.

Strategy for a Bargaining Coalition: The Like Minded Group and the

Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006.

Although a new round of trade negotiations was effectively
launched at Doha in spite of the opposition of developing countries,
the active participation of developing countries was not entirely in
vain. Perhaps the biggest indicator of a newfound sensitivity in the
WTO to development concerns is the fact that the new round was
given the name of the ‘Doha Development Agenda’. Paragraph 2 of
the main Ministerial Declaration states: ‘The majority of WTO
104

members are developing countries. We seek to place their needs and
interests at the heart of the Work Programme adopted in this
Declaration.’ Arvind Panagariya notes that the main Ministerial
Declaration itself uses the expressions ‘least developed’ countries 29
times, ‘developing’ countries 24 times, and ‘LDC’ 19 times, while
many of the annexes deal with issues of speciﬁc concern to
developing countries. It is also important to emphasize that the
Doha Development Agenda is little more than a framework on
future negotiations. What goes into the actual negotiations and
eventual agreements is still up for grabs.

105

The Doha Development Agenda

Among the victories for the developing countries, the most
widely cited one soon after the Doha Ministerial Conference
was the Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPs) and Public Health. The context for this was the
campaign by many developing countries to get cheaper access to
expensive, patented drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS
(see box below). In language that conforms largely with the
proposals of developing countries, particularly as advanced by the
coalition on TRIPs and public health. The declaration states: ‘the
TRIPs agreement does not and should not prevent Members from
taking measures to protect public health. . . . In this connection,
we reafﬁrm the right of WTO Members to use, to the full, the
provisions in the TRIPs Agreement, which provide ﬂexibility for
this purpose.’ It is true that the Declaration is really a political one,
but its importance goes well beyond the symbolic. The Declaration
will make it politically very difﬁcult to bring a dispute against a
country that uses compulsory licensing or parallel imports of
patented medicines in response to public health emergencies.
Member governments will have considerable leeway in
determining what constitutes a national emergency. Further,
for LDCs, the declaration extends the transition period by
another ten years, i.e. upto 2016, on pharmaceutical
products.

The AIDS pandemic and TRIPs

World Trade Organization

Before the advent of the TRIPs agreement, many developing
countries had offered minimal patent protection for pharmaceuticals to ensure the provision of cheap medicines for
their populations. This changed under TRIPs, which not only
required developing countries to provide patent protection,
but also restricted the conditions under which compulsory
licences could be issued (that is licences to endow another
party with the right to produce a product without the patentholder’s permission, intended to produce more affordable
generic drugs). Compulsory licences could be issued in
instances of national emergency, but even then generic drugs
could only be produced for domestic markets and not export.
Faced with the AIDS panedemic, South Africa enacted a
Medicines Act in December 1997, which allowed compulsory
licensing for the manufacture of generic HIV/AIDS drugs. It
also permitted parallel imports so that South Africa could
import the cheapest patented medicines.
Pharmaceutical companies in South Africa retaliated with
legal action in Pretoria High Court. They argued that the
Medicines Act violated constitutional guarantees of property rights, as well as TRIPs, by allowing for uncompensated compulsory licensing. The US backed the pharmaceuticals by placing South Africa on the ‘watch list’ under
Section 301 and suspending duty-free access to its South
African imports under the Generalized System of Preferences. Similar pressure was exercised on Brazil and Thailand, which had also used the emergency provisions of
TRIPs to issue compulsory licences to address their AIDS
crises.
These heavy-handed tactics by the pharmaceuticals and the
US catalysed a coalition of developing countries and NGOs
106

into action. The coalition drew a direct link between corporate greed and countless preventable HIV/AIDS-related
deaths. It further pointed out that the US was trying to prevent countries from using the emergency exception that
TRIPs provided to save lives. Led by the African Group,
developing countries and NGOs sought a ministerial declaration that clariﬁed TRIPs provisions on public health, and
guaranteed the right of governments to put public health and
welfare before patents protection. It was through the efforts
of this coalition of state and non-state actors that the Declaration of TRIPs and Public Health was ﬁnally agreed upon at
the Doha Ministerial.

Besides the Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health, developing
countries were promised improved market access in nonagricultural products. In agriculture, the Declaration agreed to
special and differential treatment for developing countries in order
to ensure that their development needs, including food security and
rural development, are met. Implementation-related issues ﬁnd
mention in the main Declaration as well as an independent
decision. Two new working groups were set up in areas speciﬁcally
of interest to developing countries, namely the Working Group on
Trade, Debt and Finance and the Working Group on Trade and
Transfer of Technology. There was also a focus on enhancing
technical assistance and capacity-building in developing countries.
Special attention was paid to the needs of the Least Developed
Countries (LDCs) as well as the small and vulnerable economies.
Seen by many as one of the biggest concessions by the US, the
107

The Doha Development Agenda

Coalition on Intellectual Property and Public Health, 2001’,

World Trade Organization

Declaration sets the agenda for clarifying and improving disciplines
of anti-dumping duties, besides subsidies and countervailing
measures. And in contrast to the Clinton administration’s last
minute attempt to put labour standards onto the negotiating table
at Seattle, the main Declaration only reafﬁrmed the decision
reached at the Singapore Ministerial. Paragraph 44 of the main
declaration afﬁrms that the provisions of Special and Differential
Treatment (S&D) ‘form an integral part of the WTO Agreements.’
These are no small achievements, but at what cost were they
obtained?
In return for the above gains, developing countries paid a
potentially heavy price. Although they had raised the demand that
the implementation issues be addressed before the launch of a new
round, they have been linked to the negotiating process of the new
round and in exchange for new commitments. This means that
developing countries will pay twice over for their so-called gains
from the Uruguay Round – precisely the outcome that the LMG had
sought to avoid. Through ambiguous language and some deft
negotiations in the last minute, the Singapore issues were
introduced into the DDA. The problems with the process whereby
the Singapore issues were introduced were discussed in Chapter 3;
the same ambiguous phrasing and disputed process was to
contribute to the confrontation at the Cancun Ministerial
Conference in 2003. In areas that have been explicitly devoted to
the interests of developing countries, such as technical assistance,
technology transfer, and the new work programme for small
economies, there is little by way of concrete deliverables. In the
absence of any clear provisions on where the funding for these
capacity-building and technology transfer activities will come from,
there is a real danger that these clauses will remain little more than
an expression of good will.
In many ways, the naming of the new round as the Doha
Development Agenda suggests an attempt by all parties to restore
the faith of the marginalized developing countries in the WTO.
108

Collapse at Cancun
Trade negotiators met at the biennial WTO ministerial meeting –
in September 2003 in Cancun – to go about the task of completing
the negotiations for the DDA to try and meet the deadline of
January 2005. They had spent the previous two years in
preparation for the Cancun Ministerial under the auspices of the
Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) set up by the Doha
Declaration. The TNC established seven negotiating bodies –
agriculture, non-agricultural market access (NAMA), services,
rules, trade and environment, geographical indications for wines
and spirits, and reform of the Dispute Settlement Understanding –
to conduct negotiations in each of the speciﬁc areas. Organization
and streamlining of the process of negotiation, however, could not
overcome the deep political differences that existed among
countries over the issues under discussion, and the Ministerial
ended in failure.

109

The Doha Development Agenda

However, the process whereby the DDA was actually agreed upon
has meant that this faith remains tenuous. Even though the
preparatory process leading up to the Doha Ministerial Conference
allowed for greater internal transparency and inclusion of
developing countries, many developing countries complained in
conﬁdential interviews with the author that these good practices
were thrown out of the window when the crunch came at Doha.
India and Pakistan, for instance, had protested vehemently when
Stuart Harbinson issued the Chair’s text under his own authority,
but this text was nonetheless used as the basis of the negotiation.
Stories of bilateral pressure that was exercised on the capitals
abound. Similarly, there are several anecdotes of how ‘difﬁcult’
ambassadors were brought under pressure (e.g. one ambassador
was allegedly asked, ‘Do you want to be consulted or do you want
to be insulted?’). Consensus on the DDA, reached under such
circumstances, would come to haunt the negotiation process most
visibly at the next ministerial at Cancun.

World Trade Organization

The year 2002 was dotted with missed deadlines and only a few
achievements. The major success story of the year was an
agreement within the TRIPs Council on parallel imports of
essential medicines by countries lacking indigenous capacity for
production. As a result of this agreement, developing countries can
now import cheap generic drugs produced under compulsory
licensing in other developing countries. The subsequent
preparatory process was swamped by attempts to reach agreement
on the extremely nettling issue of agriculture, and differences
continued across issues. As the date for the Cancun Ministerial
approached, the Chair of the General Council – Ambassador Carlos
Perez del Castillo – attempted to break the deadlock by issuing a
compromise Chair’s text under his own authority. The reactions
that this text provoked from developing countries were discussed in
Chapter 3; the joint EU-US text on agriculture (August 13) did little
to alleviate the misgivings of developing countries that the two
giants would ‘pull another Blair House Accord on us’. (The Blair
House Accord provided the basis for the Agreement on Agriculture
in the Uruguay Round, which was reached between the EU and the
US and at the exclusion of developing countries.) The Cancun
Ministerial thus began on a note of distrust from developing
countries – distrust that the Doha Ministerial had itself exacerbated
– which soon developed into a full-scale North-South
confrontation.
Problems in the consultation and decision-making processes at
Cancun and their role in exacerbating the tension between
developed and developing countries were discussed in Chapter 3.
The substance of the discussions on three issue-areas has also
proven highly problematic. The biggest sources of impasse at
Cancun were agriculture, Singapore issues, and cotton. Before
discussing these three issues, however, one caveat is in order: the
focus on the three issues does not imply that any of the other issues
were resolved or will provide any easy solutions in the future.
Differences over issues such as NAMA and S & D continued to
simmer at Cancun, and will re-emerge in the forthcoming talks.
110

Agriculture had proven to be the knottiest of issues for the summer
of 2003 and became the bête noir of Cancun. Until the EU and the
US came out with their joint draft in August, the Cairns Group
countries with an offensive interest in large-scale agricultural
liberalization had hoped that the US would back their position.
Similarly, countries with a more defensive interest in agriculture
had hoped that the EU would support their position. Developing
countries from both sets of interests came together under the
leadership of Brazil and India when they realized that the EU and
the US had joined forces to produce a highly unsatisfactory text.
Herein lay the origins of one of the most interesting coalitions of
developing countries in recent times – the G20 – which had as its
core membership such emerging powers as Brazil, China, India,
South Africa, and Argentina.

111

The Doha Development Agenda

The G20 put forth its draft on 2 September 2003, which was signed
by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Mexico, Pakistan,
Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and
Venezuela. The group proposed more radical cuts on domestic
support measures than the EU-US draft had committed, including
a capping on the Green Box subsidies. On market access, it
overcame potential differences between countries like Brazil with
an offensive interest and countries like India with a defensive
interest, by demanding greater commitments from developed
countries. For instance, the draft stated, ‘All developed countries
shall provide duty-free access to all tropical products and others
mentioned in Preamble to the Agreement on Agriculture as well as
to other agricultural products representing []% of exports from
developing countries.’ It further stated. ‘There will be no
commitments regarding TRQ expansion and reduction in quota
tariff rates for developing countries.’ In keeping with the agenda of
the G33 (see box), it pressed for a Special Safeguard Mechanism for
developing countries. On export subsidies, the G20 proposed the
elimination of export subsidies of interest to developing countries
within a target date and further a commitment to reduce export

subsidies on remaining products by a later speciﬁed date.
References to Special and Differential Treatment appeared
throughout the proposal.

World Trade Organization

The Chair’s revised text, also known as the Derbez text and
presented on 13 September, did little to address the concerns of the
G20; in some ways it was even seen to go backwards. Amongst other
objections to the draft, the G20 pointed out that reductions
proposed in domestic support were inadequate, and there was an
imbalance in the commitments between developed and developing
countries on market access. Interestingly, in contrast to the LMG
that had collapsed in the endgame at Doha, the G20 did not collapse
under divide and rule tactics at Cancun. Each side stood united at
Cancun, and neither backed down on the last day of the conference.

Coalitions at Cancun
Some coalitions at Cancun dated back at least to the Doha
Ministerial, if not earlier, while others were a product of new
challenges. Besides the G20, three others emerged as key
players at Cancun.
The Core Group of developing countries initially comprised
12 members: Bangladesh, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Venezuela, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. In response to a paper by the EU, which had
assumed that the negotiation on Singapore issues would
commence after Cancun, the Core Group submitted a joint
statement in July pointing out that explicit consensus was a
necessary condition for negotiations to consensus. The group
continued to operate at the Cancun Ministerial and
expanded in its membership.
The Alliance on Strategic Products and Special Safeguard
Mechanism initially comprised over 20 countries from Central and Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
112

Africa. The group proposed that developing countries be
allowed to designate certain products as ‘strategic products’
on which they would not be expected to take on any new
commitments. A special safeguard mechanism would be
established to protect the domestic markets of these countries against import surges. By the 13 September, the group
had expanded to 33 members.

The coalitions of Cancun were striking in their ability to
endure pressures and remain united in the endgame at Cancun, but also their durability thereafter. These coalitions
presented detailed, well-researched proposals at Cancun and
afterwards. They also made a conscious attempt to coordinate their positions. Representatives across coalitions met
frequently at the ministerial for joint consultations and new
‘alliances of sympathy’. Recognizing that this bloc unity holds
the key to their bargaining power, especially in the light of
their history of failed experiments with issue-based coalitions, the coalitions of Cancun have attempted to retain their
intra- and inter-group cohesion in its aftermath.

113

The Doha Development Agenda

The third interesting coalition of Cancun was the G90. The
African Group, ACP, and the LDCs came together to
coordinate their positions on the ﬁnal day of the conference,
leading to the creation of the G90. While the G90’s immediate concern was to resist an inclusion of negotiations on the
Singapore issues through the back door, it has been increasingly vocal since Cancun on issues such as S & D, the erosion
of preferences, and potential problems from a rapid liberalization of NAMA.

World Trade Organization

The Singapore issues provided another terrain for a North-South
showdown. Making expected use of the ambiguity of the language
of ‘explicit consensus’ that had been introduced in the Doha
Declaration, the EU’s interpretation was that the Singapore issues
were already within the DDA mandate and all that countries had to
do in Cancun was to negotiate modalities. Developing countries, in
contrast, operating as the Core Group on Singapore issues, were
vehement in their insistence that ‘Explicit consensus on the
modalities is required for negotiations to commence not consensus
on how to classify and group the different procedural and structural
aspects of the Singapore issues.’ This difference in interpretation led
to considerable acrimony, ﬁrst over the Castillo draft and
subsequently over the Derbez draft. The latter text, meant to be a
compromise text, catalysed the anger of many developing countries
as it outlined the modalities for government procurement and trade
facilitation and stated that ‘we decide to commence negotiations’ in
the two areas. On investment too, the text allowed for a period of
clariﬁcation, but then went on to state that modalities would have
to be agreed upon by a speciﬁed date (that were still to be
discussed). Only in the area of competition policy was the wording
less rigorous, leaving this area primarily to the clariﬁcation stage
and with no immediate binding commitments. But this was cold
comfort to developing countries, which had opposed the inclusion
of the Singapore issues in the ﬁrst place and had believed that the
‘explicit consensus’ requirement would prevent any last-minute
backdoor inclusions. In spite of differences among developing
countries (some argued that the Singapore issues could be
‘unbundled’ and discussed individually on their own merit, while
others advanced the position that the Singapore issues represented
a different genre of issues and should be treated as one basket), they
were united in their opposition to the Derbez text.
On the ﬁnal day of the Cancun meeting, Derbez chose to focus on
the Singapore issues – a choice that prompted some surprise from
delegations in subsequent interviews with the author, which had
expected a focus on agriculture. And here as well lay another
114

deal-breaker. Botswana, speaking on behalf of the Africa Group,
declared that they could not accept any deal that included even one
of the Singapore issues. Japan and South Korea reacted by
announcing that any deal would have to include all four of the
Singapore issues. The intractability of the Singapore issues ﬁnally
led Derbez to throw in the towel.

The closure of the conference occurred on an acerbic note of
ﬁnger-pointing and name-calling. US Trade Representative Robert
Zoellick assigned blame to the ‘won’t do’ countries at Cancun, and
115

The Doha Development Agenda

While the Singapore issues provided the immediate cause for the
collapse at Cancun, differences over the Cotton Initiative had
contributed to the crisis of faith in the WTO. Four West and Central
African countries had proposed a complete phase-out of cotton
subsidies in the developed countries, and ﬁnancial compensation
until the phase-out was complete. The US position, however, was to
refuse to discuss cotton subsidies and instead have a broader
discussion on textiles and clothing. Even after all the deliberations
on cotton under the chairmanship of Supachai, the Derbez text
leaned dangerously close to the US position. It called for
consultations to ‘address the impact of distortions that exist in the
trade of cotton, man-made ﬁbres, textiles and clothing to ensure
comprehensive consideration of the entirety of the sector’. It
committed no new resources towards ﬁnancial compensation, and
instead only instructed some of the international organizations to
direct existing programs and resources to economic diversiﬁcation
in countries where cotton accounted for a major share in GDP. The
disappointment and shock of the African countries to this proposal
was considerable, and was echoed by other countries as well. The
meanness of concessions on an area that constitutes such a small
fraction of the economy and populations of developed countries
was seen as symbolic of the refusal of developed countries to make
any concessions at all for even the poorest of the world’s poor. The
cotton issue may have been a small one in economic terms, but it
contributed to the growing levels of distrust and antagonism.

announced that the US would not wait for these countries and
instead seek bilateral agreements outside of the WTO. EU
Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy reiterated that the WTO
was a ‘medieval organization’. That the last two of the three WTO
ministerials had failed did not augur well for the future of
the organization. At Cancun itself, outside the corridors
and the meeting rooms, NGOs claimed victory for the poor of the
world.

The show must go on: DDA after Cancun
Despite the triumphalism in the press of some developing countries
and NGO publications, and the recurrent adage of ‘No deal is better
than this deal’, all the players recognized that the situation of
impasse represented victory for no one. After a temporary lull, the
negotiators were ﬁnally able to break the stalemate in the
celebrated ‘July Package’ on 31 July 2004. Two factors allowed the
negotiators to overcome the impasse that had proved so difﬁcult
to resolve at Cancun.
First, the developed countries had come to recognize the altered
nature of the game as a result of the change in the participation of
developing countries. In the past, coalitions of developing countries
had adopted some extremely intransigent positions through the
greater part of the negotiation, and then fragmented in the
endgame in response to bilateral deals. This record led developed
countries to assume that the same pattern would be repeated in
Cancun, and hence that no concessions made collectively to the
117

World Trade Organization

counter-coalitions of the G20, ACP, G33, LDCs, and others would
be necessary. The fact that the coalitions of Cancun stood united in
the face of such pressures demonstrated to the developed countries
that they would have to make at least some concessions if a
complete breakdown in the Doha talks was to be avoided. Second,
both sides recognized that the WTO could not afford another failure
without a serious blow to its credibility and its very existence. The
deadline for agreeing to a framework package for the negotiations,
which had evaded Cancun, had been re-set for the end of July and
had to be met.
The July Package – a framework where all the details have yet to be
negotiated – postpones the deadline for the completion of the Doha
Round to an unspeciﬁed date and thereby presents a reality check
on the ambitions of the Doha Ministerial. As a compromise from
the EU, all the Singapore issues except trade facilitation have been
dropped. Even on trade facilitation, in response to the concerns of
developing countries, the Framework provides that developing
countries will not be required to implement the ﬁnal agreement
where they lack the necessary capacity or infrastructure. Cotton has
been placed on a separate fast-track, in contrast to the US position
at Cancun that had attempted to scuttle cotton within a broader
sector. But the annex on agriculture presents the icing on the cake.
The annex on agriculture presents a ‘tiered’ formula approach for
the phasing out of domestic subsidies. This means that countries
with more domestic support will have to make greater reductions,
while developing countries will be allowed longer implementation
periods as well as lower reduction coefﬁcients. The annex states that
direct and indirect export subsidies will be phased out, and the
tiered formula will ensure that market access commitments
of developed and developing countries will not be the same.
Both developed and developing countries will be able to designate
sensitive products on which smaller tariff cuts will be required. In
addition, developing countries will be allowed to designate Special
Products, which will take into account their non-trade concerns of
118

food security, rural development, and so forth. The Special
Safeguard Mechanism has also been incorporated. LDCs will not be
required to reduce tariffs. Developed countries have also promised
to make a ‘down payment’ in the form of a 20% cut in their
subsidies in the ﬁrst year. Given the extent of differences at Cancun
between the G20 and G33 on one side, and the EU and the US on
the other, the annex on agriculture is no mean achievement, and
gestures like the down payment may help restore the low levels of
trust that came to the fore at Cancun.

Besides dangers that even the July Package might eventually result
in only limited agricultural liberalization, non-agricultural market
access remains a Pandora’s Box on which little progress was made
in July. This was largely because of the developing country position
that they would not negotiate on this issue as long as the deadlock
on agriculture persisted. Already, potential rifts are evident here,
many of which are actually within the developing world. For
instance, the ﬁrst draft of the July package stated that the reduction
commitments of developing countries in agriculture and the
non-agricultural sector would take into account ‘their levels of
development in particular sectors’. This provision, however, was
watered down as it was seen as privileging some of the smaller
119

The Doha Development Agenda

A closer inspection, however, reveals some critical actual and
potential loop-holes. The 20% reduction in subsidies as down
payment is to be calculated against bound levels rather than applied
levels; as developed countries, in practice, subsidize well below the
bound levels, this may result in minimal real reductions. Market
access may well be rendered meaningless depending on what
developed countries decide to include on their list of sensitive
products. Even though developed countries have agreed to a
phase-out of domestic subsidies, Green Box subsidies will still be
allowed and could be manipulated through reclassiﬁcation and
redeﬁnitions. Similarly, much will depend on how the tiered
formula actually evolves, and what dates are negotiated for export
subsidy reductions.

World Trade Organization

economies against the middle-income economies of the developing
world. The language of ‘shall be taken into account’ was changed to
‘should’, and an MFN provision was thrown in to guard against
preferential treatment along these lines. It is extremely likely that
these differences will re-surface once the actual negotiations under
this framework begin.
By the time of the July Package and thereafter, moreover, even
though some of the older issues like agriculture have shown signs of
resolution, new problems have emerged. For instance, with the end
of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing – something that
developing countries had long desired – there is now a sense of
considerable alarm that many developing countries will lose their
markets to the highly competitive textile exports from China.
Similarly, as the pace of liberalization increases, certain groups of
countries like the ACP group are concerned about their declining
preferences in speciﬁc regional markets. The July Package,
moreover, has also thrown up some critical process-related
concerns. The July Package was largely a deal struck by ‘Five
Interested Parties’, that is, Australia, Brazil, EU, India, and the US.
Admittedly, Brazil and India maintained close links with other
developing countries, particularly via the G20. But several other
countries that were not a part of the G20 complained of
marginalization from the process.
All the above problems indicate a trend towards increasing
differences within the developing world, which is likely to continue
as the nitty-gritty of the negotiations takes shape and they have to
engage in speciﬁc give and take rather than grand posturing over
principles. Cancun will be presented as an exemplar of the
successful coalition diplomacy of developing countries, when
developing countries were ﬁnally able to put up a united front and
refuse to accept a sub-optimal agreement. But it remains to be seen
if the coalitions of Cancun are able to withstand the pressures of
increasing differentiation within and pressures from without as the
negotiations progress.
120

Finally, to return our focus on the big picture: what do the failures
of Seattle and Cancun versus the ‘successes’ of Doha and the July
Package tell us about the health of the WTO as an international
organization? Could institutional reform within the WTO help in
establishing institutional equilibrium, which might curb the
pendulum swings of alternating success and failure? And, if so, then
what directions might institutional reform take? I explore these
issues in the next and concluding chapter.

Chapter 7
The burden of governance

Over the past ﬁve years, the WTO has lurched from one crisis to
another. Admittedly no multilateral process, especially when it
involves such a diversity of countries, can be expected to be an easy
ride. But the failure rate of WTO ministerial conferences and
recurring stalemates are considerably higher than the GATT had
ever encountered, and seem only to be increasing in frequency. The
public protests against the organization, particularly at the Seattle
Ministerial and subsequent meetings, suggest a perceived
disfranchisement on a scale and intensity that is qualitatively
different from the kind reﬂected in the occasional demonstrations
in the 1990s against ‘GATTzilla’. These difﬁculties point to a deeper
malaise that afﬂicts the WTO, rather than just the teething
problems of a new organization, and have prompted considerable
soul-searching among participants and observers alike.
Recent reﬂections on the nature of the WTO as an international
organization, as well as related proposals for institutional reform,
have taken three directions. The ﬁrst traces recent problems in
terms of a ‘how’ question: the persistence of obsolete methods of
decision-making have pushed the organization to this point in
crisis. Reforming these processes will put a stop to the recurrence of
crises and allow a smoother governance of the international trading
system. Others argue that the question is a deeper, more
fundamental one – a ‘what’ question – the problem with the WTO is
not how it goes about its business but really what it does or has
122

The burden of governance

12. The democratic deﬁcit of the WTO has entered public debate in a
way that it had never done in the years of the GATT

come to do. The third form of scepticism derives primarily from a
‘who’ question, but one that also relates to the previous two, which
is: we need to take a closer look at whom the WTO is really
accountable to. According to this last view, the deep-rooted,
democratic deﬁcit of the organization holds the key to its recurrent
crises. A brief overview of these different strands of thought follows
123

below, as well as the insights that they offer on how the WTO got to
this point and ways in which it might evolve.

World Trade Organization

Reforming a ‘medieval’ organization
After the failure of the Cancun Ministerial, EU Trade
Commissioner, and now the new Director-General Elect, Pascal
Lamy’s announcement that this ‘medieval’ organization was in
urgent need of reform did not come as news to the disfranchised
majority of developing country delegates, who had been protesting
against the exclusionary decision-making processes in the WTO for
years. But with developed countries turning to the issue of
institutional reform, the agenda entered the mainstream debate
and turned to the immediate and obvious target of consensus-based
decision-making.

Proposals for and against a consultative board
Commenting on the inefﬁcient and arduous decision-making
procedures at Seattle and Cancun, some governments and
individuals advanced the view that the WTO sets itself up for failure
by requiring that all decisions be arrived at through consensus
among its 148 members. Previously, in the days of the GATT and
the ﬁrst few years of the WTO, only a few members would be
present in the Green Room meetings, allowing consensus to
emerge. Improved transparency of the Green Room processes since
Seattle has facilitated the participation of members that had
traditionally been excluded from decision-making. But with 148
members at the negotiating table, decision-making has becoming
inefﬁcient, if not impossible. The only way of overcoming this fatal
ﬂaw in the WTO is the establishment of an executive or consultative
board of some sort.
Proposals for a consultative board come from several sources. The
EU has maintained a consistent support for this view in the
aftermath of the failures at Seattle as well as Cancun. Canada put
forth the proposal for a new committee resembling the UN Security
124

Most developing countries, including those who have found it
difﬁcult to gain access to the small group meetings, have come out
strongly against proposals for a consultative board of any kind.
From their perspective, the only thing that the WTO has going for
it, particularly when compared against the international ﬁnancial
institutions and their system of weighted voting, is its one-memberone-vote consensus-based decision-making processes. The creation
of a consultative board that distinguishes between permanent and
non-permanent members would destroy whatever semblance of
international equality exists in the WTO by effectively creating a
system of weighted voting based on world trade shares.
There are three practical reasons as to why a consultative body,
created along any of the variations suggested above, would be
deeply problematic. First, given the binding nature and intrusive
potential of WTO rules, it is unlikely that individual countries
125

The burden of governance

Council in regional representation and the rotation of nonpermanent members. Mexico proposed the transformation of the
Green Room into a ‘Glass Room’, in which 25% of the WTO’s
members (34 at the time of the proposal) would participate; the 15
members with the greatest shares in world trade would act as
permanent members. The remaining 19 members would be chosen
according to regional criteria, where the selection would be made by
the countries of the relevant region. Jeffrey Schott and Jayashree
Watal made a similar proposal in a research paper in 2000 of an
informal steering committee of 20 members based on absolute
value of foreign trade and geographic representation ensuring
representation with at least two members from each region. In
2003, Richard Blackhurst and David Hartridge argued for a
consultative board. The larger countries would have permanent
seats on the board, while the other members would be divided into
groups with one seat per group (occupied by members within each
group on a rotating basis). All these proposals have emphasized that
that the board would have only consultative, consensus-building
powers and not any decision-making ones.

World Trade Organization

would accept the advisory recommendations of any inter-state
consultative body. Most members of the WTO have come to
recognize from harsh experience that the consultative phase of the
negotiations is also the agenda-setting one, and entry into the ﬁnal
decision-making phase is no substitute for participation in the
initial consultative phase. Second, non-permanent seats based on
regional representation are especially unlikely to work given the
vast differences that exist even within regions when it comes to
speciﬁc issue areas. Third, as one group of developing countries
has noted, ‘Creation of an advisory board would formalise the
exclusion of a large number of Members from the process of
consultations.’
A possible way of striking a balance between the efﬁciency and
legitimacy arguments to ﬁnd a compromise between the onemember-one-vote consensus-based decision-making and the
consultative board. Elements of this compromise can be found in a
proposal that was put forth by Vinod Rege, Advisor to the
Commonwealth developing countries in Geneva. Rege suggests the
creation of an Informal Steering Committee at the beginning of
each year, on the recommendations of the Chair of the General
Council in consultation with the other chairpersons of the three
councils. The list of participants would reﬂect the different stages of
development and interests of the member countries, and would
depend on the particular schedule of meetings and issues under
discussion for that year. The Committee would not be a standing
committee but could be invoked when small-group consultations
became necessary. The Rege proposal could be extended to the
creation of sub-committees with different memberships, depending
on the interests of particular countries in speciﬁc issue areas based
on invitation by the chairs but also self-selection. Two problems,
however, stand in the way of implementing such a proposal. First,
some developing countries object to a consultative body as a matter
of principle and are unlikely to accept any variation of this idea. And
second, while the developed Rege variant allows the consultative
body ﬂexibility to operate at different sub-committee levels, the
126

complicated manoeuvres required to establish these committees
might turn out to be as inefﬁcient as the current consensus-based
process.

Diplomatic ﬂexibility versus rules-based certainty

The like minded group (LMG) has made many formal and informal
proposals advancing the latter view. In 2002, for instance, the LMG
argued that: ‘uncertainty in the process makes it difﬁcult for many
Members to prepare themselves for the conferences. Some basic
principles and procedures for this Member-driven organization
need to be agreed upon, so that both the preparatory process and
the conduct of the Ministerial Conference are transparent, inclusive
and predictable.’ To this end, the group proposed that ‘Any
negotiating procedure to be adopted should be approved by
Members by consensus in formal meetings.’ The document insisted
that ‘The draft ministerial declaration should be based on
consensus. Where this is not possible, such differences should be
fully and appropriately reﬂected in the draft ministerial
declaration’; and ‘A draft ministerial declaration can only be
forwarded to the Ministerial Conference by the General Council
upon consensus to do so.’ The group found support from other
developing countries on this matter, including in a proposal put
forth by a group of African countries. Some NGOs have taken the
proposal for greater formality of rules even further. For instance,
127

The burden of governance

Another question of institutional reform over which daggers have
been drawn relates less to any one procedure than to the broader
manner of the WTO’s functioning. It is interesting to note that
countries that are in favour of the consultative body also usually
emphasize the continued beneﬁts of GATT-derived negotiating
ﬂexibility and diplomatic improvisation as providing the
groundwork for the WTO. In contrast, many developing countries
that have supported the continuation of one-member-one-vote,
consensus-based decision-making have advanced proposals to
strengthen rules about the negotiation process.

ten mainstream NGOs (The Third World Network, Oxfam
International, Public Services International, WWF International,
The Center for International Environmental Law, Focus on the
Global South, The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, The
African Trade Network, International Gender and Trade Network,
and the Tebtebba International Center for Indigenous Peoples’
Rights) stated in a memorandum in July 2003 that ‘Meetings
should all be ofﬁcial, with minutes taken down and circulated to
Members for amendments or conﬁrmation.’
The second view is typiﬁed in a proposal put forth jointly by
Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand,
Singapore, and Switzerland in 2002. This proposal makes a direct
reference to the LMG draft and presents an alternative view on
many of the points presented in the LMG proposal. In contrast to
the call for explicit rules and clearly laid down procedures, the
eight-country proposal argues that ‘Prescriptive and detailed
approaches to the preparatory process are inappropriate and will
not create the best circumstances for consensus to emerge in the
Cancun meeting.’ It stresses the importance of ﬂexibility in a
member-driven organization. In contrast to the LMG proposal,
which suggests a suspicion of ministerial-level processes, this
proposal argues that ‘The preparatory process should leave space
for the Ministerial Conference to take up those issues which call for
resolution at the ministerial level.’
The two sets of views have proven difﬁcult to reconcile, not least
because they are based on conﬂicting interests and abilities. The
LMG view conforms neatly with Stephen Krasner’s argument that
developing countries seek authoritative regimes. Their search for
greater certainty, and hence more formalized and tighter rules,
derives from their comparatively limited capabilities to understand
and negotiate the increasing technicality of an expanding set of
issues that fall within the mandate of the WTO. Countries with
well-identiﬁed proactive interests in the WTO and an ability to
pursue them, in contrast, stress the virtues of ﬂexibility and attach
128

Questioning the mandate
The second set of debates about the WTO has focused on its
mandate. Scepticism about the reach of the WTO derives from
member countries and NGOs.
Among the member countries, discord about the scope of the
WTO’s evolving mandate is inevitable, and presents a general divide
between the developed and developing world. Much of the agenda
for an expansion of GATT/WTO rules into new areas has been led
by developed countries, for instance the inclusion of services,
TRIPs, TRIMs, and subsequently the drive to include the Singapore
issues. However, as Chapter 3 argued, many developing countries
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to keep pace even with the existing negotiating
agenda and implement current agreements, let alone have the
expertise to identify their interests in newer areas. Given these
logistical difﬁculties, the default position of developing countries
has been to ‘just say no’ to the entry of absolutely any new issue into
the WTO and reiterate the importance of resolving some of the
older problems. The extreme divergence of these views presents the
129

The burden of governance

considerable importance to the diplomacy that has traditionally
provided the groundwork for GATT and WTO negotiations. They
translate into two competing visions of the WTO as an international
organization. The LMG-type view is, on balance, of a limited,
technocratic organization with a well-circumscribed mandate and
tightly bound by a clearly speciﬁed set of rules and procedures. In
contrast, the developed country view is one of an expansive
organization that cuts across issue areas, and is driven by politics
rather than technicalities and detailed rules. It is also one that relies
signiﬁcantly on ﬂexibility of negotiating procedure, small-group
meetings within and outside the WTO, and considerable political
involvement. These two divergent visions have some important
implications for the ways in which the WTO might be held
accountable to its various constituencies, as discussed in the last
section of this chapter.

World Trade Organization

WTO with a Catch 22 situation. If the WTO slows the pace of the
negotiations, it risks losing the commitment of its developed
countries; if it continues with the expansion, however, in line with
the agenda of the developed countries, it risks the further
marginalization of the majority of its members and a further decline
in the legitimacy of its decisions.
In an attempt to keep both constituencies aboard, some scholars and
policy-makers have proposed the dismantling of the Single
Undertaking and its replacement with multiple tracks based on
‘variable geometry’. Still in its early stages, this idea has not attracted
much reaction yet from developed or developing countries. It is
worth recalling that the EU expansion has adopted a similar
dual-track mechanism, and seems to be working successfully. If it
does enter the policy debate in a serious way in the WTO, however,
two caveats are worth bearing in mind. First, the Single
Undertaking was crucial to the making of the Grand Bargain that
led to the creation of the WTO. It still remains the case that crossissue exchange of concessions underlies the completion of any deal,
and the existence of multiple tracks will make such concessions
difﬁcult. Second, by avoiding commitments on areas covered by a
hypothetical Track 2 and taking on only Track 1 commitments,
developing countries will effectively marginalize themselves from
the critical agenda-setting and rule-making phase for Track 2. As
countries now seeking accession to the WTO are learning, the costs
of late entry can be quite high. Vigilance is especially important in
multilateralism when such divergent sets of interests and visions are
involved and power inequalities are so extreme.
While developing countries have complained about the fast pace of
the negotiations and expanding agenda, many NGOs have
expressed dissatisfaction with the WTO for the opposite reason:
that its agenda is in fact far too narrow, and thereby privileges trade
over all other values. As per this view, a re-balancing of interests
within the WTO is necessary, perhaps even through a constitutional
mechanism, to ensure that trade interests are balanced by human
130

rights, environment, labour standards, gender and income
inequalities within states, development, and so forth. While there is
certainly a case to be made for expanding the reach of global norms
in these key domains, whether they should be governed through the
WTO is highly questionable for four central reasons.

Second, as Chapters 3 and 4 together argued, the expansion in the
agenda of the WTO has not been matched by commensurate
changes in the everyday workings of the WTO. Expanding the WTO
into areas such as human rights and the environment would
effectively accord the organization all the functions that a world
government might be expected to perform. The WTO is structurally
ill equipped to perform these functions with any level of efﬁciency.
Even if the organization were sufﬁciently reformed to allow it vastly
expanded powers and funds to regulate in these areas, it is doubtful
if the WTO could do so legitimately. As the next section will
illustrate, the bureaucratic accountability with which the WTO
operates differs considerably from the vertical accountability that
one expects of democratic governments. The WTO is already too big
for its boots; to expand it even further into areas where it was never
intended to go would be inefﬁcient and injudicious.
Third, despite the stated good intentions of the non-trade agenda, it
is difﬁcult in practice to ensure that these noble standards will not
be used as non-tariff barriers against imports from the developing
131

The burden of governance

First, as Chapter 4 illustrated, the problem with the WTO seems to
be excessive regulation, not an insufﬁciency thereof, as countries
increasingly complain of the shrinking of national policy space. The
discontent of populations worldwide over having to adhere to WTO
standards (e.g. on GMOs) has been pronounced. Expanding WTO
regulations even further into contested non-trade concerns would
shrink this national policy space further, depriving states of their
rights and ability to adopt goals that conform to the imperatives and
priorities of particular societies. States are unlikely to react lightly or
warmly to further encroachments into their domestic jurisdictions.

World Trade Organization

countries and deprive them of whatever comparative advantage they
enjoy. Standards of human rights, environment, and labour are often
closely related to cultural and social detail at the national and subnational levels; the establishment of universal standards in these
areas has, even in principle, been a long-contested issue. Entrusting
the WTO with guarding such contested standards through a trade
link, which might be exploited for protectionist purposes, is likely to
jeopardize the legitimacy of its decisions even further.
Finally, any petitions to expand the WTO into areas such as labour
standards and human rights must be set against the charter for the
ITO. Recall from Chapter 1 that the Havana Charter was
considerably more expansive than the GATT or the WTO, and the
fate that it suffered as a stillborn project. By logrolling the many
contradictory interests of all its different constituencies, the ITO
project collapsed under the weight of its own ambitions. In
contrast, the successes of the GATT lay in the self-imposed
limitations of its agenda. Increased global integration
notwithstanding, what was politically impossible then should be
approached at least with high levels of political caution now.
My scepticism about the further expansion of the WTO into
explicitly non-trade concerns should not be interpreted as a counsel
of despair. An international management of certain minimum
standards or norms may be possible by improving the coherence of
the global governance system. Parallel mechanisms emerging from
the private sector, for instance in the form of norms of corporate
social responsibility for multinational corporations, have begun to
take shape. Article V of the Agreement establishing the WTO
requires the General Council to make appropriate arrangements
‘for effective cooperation with other international organizations
that have responsibilities related to those of the WTO’. Paragraph 5
of the Main Doha Declaration reinforces this point:
We are aware that the challenges Members face in a rapidly
changing international environment cannot be addressed through
132

measures taken in the trade ﬁeld alone. We shall continue to work
with the Bretton Woods institutions for greater coherence in global
economic policy-making.

Reducing the democratic deﬁcit of the WTO

13. Admittedly, the immediate reaction of the developed world was to
blame the intransigence of the developing countries for the failure of
the Cancun Ministerial, illustrated in this cartoon. This knee-jerk
reaction, however, was fortunately followed by a greater willingness to
engage among all parties.
133

The burden of governance

The third set of responses to the recurrent crises within the WTO
refers to the organization’s deep-rooted democratic deﬁcit. This
deﬁcit is a product of the fact that the millions affected by the rules
of the WTO are unable to have any direct inﬂuence on the rulemaking process. As per this view, problematic decision-making
processes among member states, the expansion of the
organization’s mandate into contested areas, and the incongruities
between the weak institutional structure and the legally binding
and expansive mandate, only exacerbate the democratic deﬁcit
rather than actually cause it.

World Trade Organization

It is certainly true that rule-making in the WTO can appear far
removed from the people that it affects. NGOs or any other affected
members of civil society have no right of representation in the
WTO, whose business is conducted by national delegations from
member governments. These delegations in turn are made up of
national bureaucrats (often from the ministry of commerce or its
equivalent and the foreign ministry) rather than elected
representatives of the people. One of the few inputs that voters have
into the process is at the time of elections, when they elect
representatives to form governments. But it is usually the ministers,
with inputs from ofﬁcials in the relevant ministries, who eventually
decide whom to appoint to the delegation in Geneva, which is
involved in WTO decision-making. This long chain of delegation
means that even in the best of democracies, national delegations in
the WTO are distant from their electorates. Given this distance, it is
not surprising that many NGOs have called for greater external
transparency in WTO negotiations, and even some direct NGO
representation in the WTO with observer status if not decisionmaking powers. Similarly, others have emphasized the importance
of greater political participation at the ministerial level as well as
inter-parliamentary meetings that bring the decision-making down
at least to the level of their elected representatives rather than
faceless bureaucrats in Geneva.
On the question of whether increased ministerial or parliamentary
involvement would actually improve the WTO accountability to
affected stakeholders, the verdict is not clear. The obvious answer
seems to be that a greater involvement of elected politicians would
reduce the chain of delegation and bring governance of
international trade closer to the electorate. In practice, however,
developing country delegations – even some from the larger
developing countries – frequently complain that the highly
technical nature of WTO negotiations means that their politicians
are ill equipped to engage positively in the negotiation process.
They lack the research backing and armies of assisting ofﬁcials that
their counterparts from developed countries enjoy. As politicians,
134

they are also more susceptible to bilateral arm-twisting and
linkages with non-trade issues than their bureaucrats. Greater
involvement of elected representatives might allow greater political
commitment and speedier decision-making in the WTO. But these
decisions would be arrived at by exercising even greater pressure on
poorly-prepared ministers or other parliamentarians from
developing countries; it is therefore unlikely that such measures
would improve the democratic deﬁcit that they seek to address,
especially as ministers and their populations would begin to realize
the consequences of what they had signed up to. Indeed, the
Uruguay Round agreements, associated problems of
implementation, and the repeatedly expressed discontent of
developing countries with the perceived imbalances of the Uruguay
Round bargain are a product of this process.

In response to these demands, the WTO has made efforts to
improve NGO access to its activities. Open access is available to
almost all its documents on the WTO website. NGOs are allowed to
135

The burden of governance

The claim to greater participation of NGOs in WTO processes
acquires even greater validity when compared against the level of
private sector participation in the WTO. Wendy Dobson and Pierre
Jacquet have shown the critical role played by business coalitions in
the Uruguay Round. For instance, the US Coalition of Services
Industries and British Invisibles played a key role in the GATS
negotiations, while the Financial Leaders’ Group comprising US
and EU ﬁrms played a major role in the conclusion of the ﬁnancial
services negotiations. Similarly powerful private sector inﬂuence,
such as from pharmaceutical companies, can be traced in the
conclusion of the TRIPs agreement. Companies exercise this
inﬂuence through direct participation in the negotiation process,
especially when they are included in delegations negotiating
technical issues such as telecommunications or accountancy. In
contrast, representatives from civil society are seldom able to
exercise comparable inﬂuence, suggesting that some alternative
route to represent these interests might be in order.

World Trade Organization

present amicus curiae briefs in disputes brought before the
Appellate Body. Through an accreditation process, it is possible for
NGOs to attend Ministerial Conferences (although they are not
allowed a seat at the negotiation table unless they are included as
part of a national delegation). These measures effectively translate
into improved external transparency, but not greater participation.
A closer examination of the evidence, however, sheds considerable
doubt on whether any greater participation for NGOs, or
parliamentarians, will have any positive impact on improving the
democratic deﬁcit of the WTO.
Perhaps the biggest risk of opening the door to greater
institutionalized NGO participation in the WTO is that it is unclear
in some instances who these organizations actually represent and to
whom they might be accountable. The WTO, in its current
member-driven form, can at least claim to allow one vote to each
member government. In the case of democracies, these
representatives bear some accountability to their peoples, no matter
how far removed they are from the electorate in practice. In
contrast, not even the best of NGOs are democratically elected or
bear any other form of legal accountability to the civil society that
they claim to represent. A closer examination of NGO activity
further illustrates a risk that developing countries have long
anticipated, namely that many of the NGOs that actually manage to
gain a voice in international forums are based in developed
countries or funded by organizations in developed countries. For
instance, at the Seattle Ministerial Conference – often hailed for its
NGO activism – some 87% of the 738 accredited NGOs were based
in developed countries. Greater direct participation by NGOs in the
WTO runs the risk of tipping the balance even further away from
developing countries.
This is not to say that NGOs have no role to play in relation to the
WTO. But like the private sector that they sometimes seek to
balance against, they need to make their inroads into the WTO via
their governments or transnationally. Their role can, in fact, often
136

turn out to be a critical one in countries or on issues where technical
awareness is low. Here NGOs can serve as an invaluable research
bank and assist their governments in adopting negotiating
positions that assist the marginalized in the particular society.
When at odds with government policy, NGOs can form some critical
transnational links with other NGOs and governments. The links
between Northern and Southern NGOs, and their alliance with
developing country governments, were critical to the successful
conclusion of the TRIPs and Public Health Declaration at the Doha
Ministerial Conference. The importance of such alliances between
developing country governments and certain NGOs is only likely to
increase in the future.

137

The burden of governance

Finally, irrespective of the reform strategy that its members
eventually adopt, it is clear that the expanded mandate of the legal
WTO is out of synch with the haphazard and power-political
processes that go into the making of its legal rules. This discrepancy
needs to be corrected. Admittedly, institutional reform that allows a
greater effective voice to developing countries will result in a slower
and more arduous negotiation process. But such a process may also
turn out to be a longer-lasting one that would enjoy greater
legitimacy, and would thereby be less disruptive to the WTO in the
longer run. Without a process of institutional reform, the
consequences are more troubling. If the WTO process continues to
stop-start in the self-destructive manner in which it has proceeded
in recent years, the developed countries might turn entirely to
bilateral and regional options. The consequences would be
expensive for both sides. For developed countries they would entail
heightened transaction costs – an unnecessary inconvenience – and
the possibility of debilitating bilateral trade wars even among
themselves. But for developing countries the consequences would
be devastating. It has taken them a long time to learn to operate
within the multilateral forum of the GATT/WTO, and they are now
ﬁnally beginning to do so with some panache through the newfound
strength of their coalitions. They would ﬁnd themselves exposed to
unprecedented bilateral pressures from the developed countries

World Trade Organization

against which they would have no institutional protection. The
WTO is all that they have against the use of unmitigated power,
and it is in their own interests to ensure its strength and
survival.
