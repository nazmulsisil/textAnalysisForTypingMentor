Introduction

Dreaming has fascinated humankind since the dawn of recorded
history. As dreaming is so vivid, so complex, and so emotional, it
has inspired religious movements, artistic representations, and
introspective scientiﬁc theories. All of these pre-modern expressions
have been based on the idea that dreams contain messages that cannot
be delivered in any other way.
Thus, it was thought by the early Judaeo-Christians that God
communicated his intentions via certain prophets to his human
subjects. This concept was the centrepiece of medieval dream theory
with its postulates of the ‘Gates of Horn and Ivory’. Religious reformers
such as Emmanuel Swedenburg were able to meet God’s angels in
dreams and he thereby received instructions about founding the Church
of the New Jerusalem.
Early Western artists, such as Giotto, used dreaming as a vehicle for the
pictorial representation of prophetic inspiration. Sleeping saints and
churchmen are shown in the same pictorial frame as the visions that
their dreams inspired. In modern art, the surrealists expressed through
their wild paintings the conviction that dreaming was a more authentic
state of consciousness than waking. Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and René
Magritte all painted in dream language. Dali was the most surreal, Ernst
the most psychoanalytic, and Magritte the most neuropsychological of
these artists.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the best known of all dream
investigators would be Sigmund Freud, who set out to base his theory
of the mind on brain science. His knowledge of the brain was so
incomplete that he was forced to abandon his famous ‘Project for a
Scientiﬁc Psychology’, and he turned to dreaming for insights about
what he construed to be the dynamic unconscious. He decided, as had
all his symbolist predecessors, that dreams concealed hidden meanings
elaborated as one part of the mind, and that the unconscious tried to
break through the protective barrier of consciousness. Freud thus threw
dream theory back to the time of Biblical scholars, Artemidorus, and
other early interpreters of dreams.
This book takes up where Freud left off when he abandoned his Project.
It tries to build a new dream theory on the now solid and extensive
base of sleep science. To accomplish this goal, I have given a concise
summary of the ﬁndings of basic brain research, sleep lab studies, and
recent clinical studies of sleep and dreams. Throughout the book, I use
examples taken from my own dream journal to illustrate how our new
theory of dreams, called activation–synthesis, can be used to explain in
physiological terms universal dream features previously ascribed to
psychodynamic factors. Once this is done, the mystery of dreaming is
largely stripped away, leaving the content nakedly open to
understanding without complex interpretation.
The main goal of this book is to show how a scientiﬁc theory of
dreaming has been developed and strengthened over the past 50 years.
In the process, the book offers the reader a unique opportunity to
reconsider his or her own dream theory and, into the bargain, to learn
about the fascinating discoveries of modern sleep science.

Chapter 1
What is dreaming?

What causes dreaming? Why are dreams so strange? Why are they
so hard to remember? A true science of dreaming requires a reliable
deﬁnition that can lead to the reliable identiﬁcation of this state
and methods of measuring its properties. During the course of work
on the brain, which led to the suspicion that it might be brain
activation in sleep that causes dreaming, we realized that the most
scientiﬁcally useful way to deﬁne and measure dreaming was to
focus on the formal features rather than the content – by this is
meant the perceptual (how we perceive), cognitive (how we think),
and emotional (how we feel) qualities of dreaming, whatever the
details of the individual stories and scenarios might be.
The radical change in emphasis, from the analysis of content to the
analysis of form, exempliﬁes what scientists call a paradigm shift
(a rapid change in pattern or theory). Through a formal approach,
we found an entirely new and different way of looking at a familiar
phenomenon. Whereas previously students of dreaming had
invariably asked ‘What does the dream mean?’, we asked what the
mental characteristics of dreaming are that distinguish it from
waking mental activity. We are not saying that dream content is
unimportant, uninformative, or even uninterpretable. Indeed, we
believe that dreaming is all three of these things, but it is already
crystal clear that many aspects of dreaming previously thought to
be meaningful, privileged, and interpretable psychologically are the
1

simple reﬂection of the sleep-related changes in brain state that we
start to detail in Chapter 3.
To provide a ﬁrmer grasp of the distinction between form and
content, I offer an example, taken at random from my own dream
journal, which is one of hundreds that I have recorded over the
years. To give a complete sense of how my journal reads and to allow
the reader to compare his or her own notes on dreaming with mine
I quote the entry in full. I know that you will dream of subjects quite
different from mine, but I suspect that the form of your dreams is
similar.
10/5/1987 En route to New Orleans for a debate on dreams at the
American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting:
Two nights ago, a dream of Richard Newland

Dreaming

It is a house maintenance nightmare. I have too much property to
maintain. Richard and a friend are ‘helping’ me but it is an
uncertain alliance, with the twin threats of incompetence and
inattentiveness.
There are several scenes all with the same emotional theme:
anxiety about maintenance details.
In one scene we are walking along in hilly country, perhaps
toward the house, but the destination is not clear.
Then we are in a house, not at all like mine but assumed by my
dreaming brain to be mine, and Richard’s friend is spray painting
the white wall (we have none in our house) with blue paint (neither
do we have any blue rooms). The paint sprayer is a tank device
of the type used to apply copper sulphate to grapevines or to
exterminate cockroaches. Suddenly, the paint is being sprayed not
only on the wall but upon a painting hanging on the wall.
My fears are conﬁrmed. I yell at Richard to bid his friend stop.
For some reason, he has to go upstairs to turn off the machine
(although it appears to be fully portable and self-contained) and this
takes an inordinate length of time as the painting continues to suffer.
There follows a long dialogue with Richard who, while retaining
continuous identity as Richard, changes physiognomy repeatedly.
2

His face changed as follows: a gnome-like Napoleon Carter with a
cherubic sun-burned face; a wry smile and a Chinese coolie-type

included Richard!
I can’t remember other faces or other action from this long episode.

Before discussing the distinctions of form against content that this
dream so clearly illustrates, I should comment on the circumstances
of its recording and the timing of its occurrence. I was on an
aeroplane, where I do a great deal of my journal writing. I was ﬂying
to New Orleans for a highly publicized and well-attended public
debate on dreaming. I usually record dreams on the morning after
their occurrence. The fact that I waited two days in this case
probably resulted in loss of detail. But, as I will presently show,
there is more than enough detail to make clear the distinction
between dream form and dream content.
As far as the content is concerned, the dream is about my concerns
for the upkeep of my farm in northern Vermont, which I have
owned since 1965. Richard Newland is the son of my farmer
neighbour, Marshall Newland, with whom I have had a long and
complicated but successful and gratifying relationship. In spite of

hat; a calf face – as in A Midsummer Night’s Dream (the ad for
which did not include the calf!); and as far as I can tell, never

Dreaming

widely divergent priorities we have managed to get along and to
help each other.
For me, the meaning of the dream is transparent: I am anxious
about my property and about entrusting it to people who are
careless about their own houses. This characteristic, known in
psychological terms as emotional salience (or relevance), is all I
need to understand the dream, which is a variant on the theme of
incomplete arrangements that is so recurrent in my dreams and in
those of most of my friends. For reasons that I discuss more fully in
Chapter 2, I see no need and no justiﬁcation for treating this dream
as a disguised, symbolic expression of anxiety about other related
themes (my wife’s interest in another Vermont neighbour, for
example). While admitting that it could be appropriate and more
useful to notice such an association, it does not help in
understanding what caused this dream, determined its comical
bizarreness, and made it so hard to remember.

Form as opposed to content
To answer the questions about causes and characteristics of dreams,
it is helpful to take a formal analytical approach.
As is typical of most dreams, I am so involved in the scenario that it
never occurs to me that I am dreaming. As I see Richard Newland
(and his unidentiﬁed friend), see my house (even though it is clearly
not mine), see the blue paint as it is sprayed on the walls, and move
through the sequence of scenes, I accept all of these unlikely
features as real on the strength of my hallucinatory perceptions, my
delusional beliefs about them, and my very strong feelings of
anxiety and apprehension.
What this means is that our sense of psychological reality – whether
normal dreaming or a psychotic symptom – is set by the strength of
percepts and feelings as well as by our thoughts about them.
Internally generated perceptions and emotions are two formal
4

features of dreams and they are cardinal features. To explain their
intensity (compared with waking), we might expect to ﬁnd that
parts of the brain that generate emotions and related percepts are
selectively activated in sleep. We see in Chapter 5 that this is
precisely what happens!

These are the cardinal cognitive features of dreaming: loss of
awareness of self (self-reﬂective awareness); loss of orientational
stability; loss of directed thought; reduction in logical reasoning;
and, last but not least, poor memory both within and after the
dream. The fact that the incongruities and discontinuities of my
Richard Newland dream are connected by association does not
explain the looseness of those associations. Thus, it is true that the
unusual spray-painting device resembles an agricultural tool; it is
also true that Richard’s transformed face is, ﬁrst, that of another
Vermont farmer neighbour, Napoleon Carter, and later a calf
(Richard and his dairy farmer father, Marshall, had many calves);
and it is remarkably true that Shakespeare himself celebrated the
transformation of characters – turning them into each other and
even into animals – in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
What causes the processing of such extreme associations
(hyperassociative processing)? Freud, like his followers, religiously
5

What is dreaming?

My Richard Newland dream is not simply perceptually vivid and
emotionally salient, it is also cognitively bizarre, by which I mean
that, despite the persistence of the main themes, there is a ﬂagrant
disregard for the constancies of time, place, and person. Notice that
Richard’s friend is not identiﬁed; notice also that the house that is
supposed to be mine could not possibly be so; and notice that the
scenes – however poorly recalled and described – meld into one
another: ﬁrst we are outside walking, then inside painting. Notice,
most of all, that Richard’s face assumes a series of non-Richard
features without ever challenging either the assumption that he is
Richard, or that I am not awake but dreaming, as even a glimmer of
self-reﬂective awareness would declare me to be.

believed that dream bizarreness was a psychological defence against
an unacceptable unconscious wish. This seemed unlikely to many
people in 1900. At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, it
seems impossible to us.

Dreaming

Just as we expect (and ﬁnd) selective activation of brain circuits
underlying emotion and related percepts in rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep, so we seek (and ﬁnd) selective inactivation of brain
circuits – and chemicals – underlying memory, directed thought,
self-reﬂective awareness, and logical reasoning.
You may be more or less pleased by the story. You might prefer to
believe that your dreams are secret messages of personal portent.
But whether you like the story or not, you must surely be as
dismayed as we were to realize that we did not really need brain
research to take this formal approach to dreaming. Common sense
alone should have dictated at least that form and content were
complementary. The distinction is made with ease in other ﬁelds:
consider linguistics, where grammar and syntax are
complementary; consider poetry, where meter and verse enhance
one another; and consider the visual arts, where genre and subject
matter interact for strong effect. So, why not the domain of mental
life itself? Why not in dreams? Isn’t the form of dreams an
important contributor to content?
As shown in Chapter 2, some brave souls did make this distinction,
but their feeble voices were drowned out by the clamour of the
interpreters who pandered to the deep-seated human need to
believe that dreaming, as for every apparent mystery, has a deeply
veiled meaning inscribed by a benevolent hand whose ways are
known only to a few chosen mediators.

Dreaming and how to measure it
Let’s begin our analytical odyssey by accepting the most broad,
general, and indisputable deﬁnition of dreaming: mental activity
6

occurring in sleep. But what kinds of mental activity occur in sleep?
Many different kinds, for example:
Report 1. As soon as I fell asleep, I could feel myself moving just the
way the sea moved our boat when I was out ﬁshing today.
Report 2. I kept thinking about my upcoming exam and about the
subject matter that it will contain. I didn’t sleep well because I kept
waking up and was inevitably pulled back to the same ruminations
about my exam.

All these reports qualify as descriptions of dreaming according to
our broad deﬁnition, although they are very different from one
another and each is typical of the kind of sleep in which it was
experienced.
Report 1 contains an internal percept, the sense of rhythmic
movement imparted by the sea to a boat and to those on board the
boat. This report is typical of sleep-onset dreams, especially on
nights following novel motor behaviour such as skiing, or boating,
or even – as in Robert Frost’s poem – After Apple Picking. The
subject has been boating, and the sense of motion, which abated
immediately upon putting his foot on shore, recommences at sleep
onset and reproduces, exactly, the physical experience of boating.
We will have more to say later about this stimulus-induced dream,
especially when we look at the theme of motor learning later in the
book. For now, let us emphasize how short and relatively simple this
sleep-onset dream experience is. Even though it is hallucinatory, as
is Report 3, it is impoverished in its brevity and its narrow scope, its
7

What is dreaming?

Report 3. I am perched on a steep mountaintop; the void falls away
to the left. As the climbing party rounds the trail to the right, I am
suddenly on a bicycle, which I steer through the group of climbers.
It becomes clear that I make a complete circuit of the peak (at this
level) by staying on the grass. There is, in fact, a manicured lawn
surface continuing between the rocks and crags.

Dreaming

lack of characters other than the dreamer, and its emotional
ﬂatness. Many sleep-onset dream reports are richer and more
variegated than this one, although they are all brief and lack the
elaborate plot development of Report 3.
Report 2 is limited to thinking, or what psychologists call cognition.
There is no perceptual structure, and hence no hallucinatory aspect.
There is emotion, however. The dreamer is anxious about
performance on a test and this anxiety appears to drive obsessive
thinking very much in the way that it might be expected to do so in
waking. The thinking described is non-progressive. The dreamer
doesn’t even rehearse the content of the exam material in a way that
might be adaptive. Accounts of rumination such as this are often
given when individuals are aroused from sleep early in the night. If
they are collected in a sleep lab – as described in Chapter 3 – they
are associated with the low levels of brain activation that typify what
we call slow wave sleep (seen on the electroencephalograph or EEG)
or non-REM sleep (NREM; this refers to the lack of eye
movement). Mental activity in NREM sleep later in the night, when
brain activation approaches that seen in REM sleep, can assume
many of the properties of Report 3.
Report 3 is a typical REM sleep report: it is animated; it is dramatic
and complex; it is bizarre; it is hallucinatory; it is delusional; and it
is long, about eight to ten times as long as Reports 1 and 2 (which
were given in their entirety), whereas only a small excerpt of Report
3 is given here. In the rest of Report 3, there was a scene change
from the mountain peak to Martha’s Vineyard Island (though I
was still on the same bicycle), and then to a shopping centre, a
restaurant, a dance, and a meeting of faculty colleagues. The dream
also exempliﬁes typical dream features, such as character instability,
because one of my colleague’s wives is seen as a blond when, in
reality, she is a brunette. The sense of movement, which is
continuous, becomes particularly delightful when I become
practically weightless and glide along a golf fairway. At the
dance there is ‘a Baltic group wearing embroidered peasant
8

garb and stamping the ﬂoor to a loud band (I can hear the drums
especially).’
There is simply no comparison between the richness of Report 3
and the restrictions of Reports 1 and 2, even though Report 2 fulﬁls
this more rigorous deﬁnition of dreaming.
Report 3 more fully illustrates a mental experience occurring in
sleep, which is characterized by:

When we think about how the very different experiences in the
three dream reports were brought about, and even what they may
mean, we can easily understand the ﬁrst two simply in terms of
brain activation that reﬂects, in sleep, the dreamer’s previous
experience (the boat trip) and concerns about the future (anxiety
about an exam). In both cases, the residual brain activation of sleep
onset and early night sleep is enough to reproduce faithfully a very
small part of waking experience. Report 3, however, needs a much
more elaborate explanation to account for its description of events,
many of which never happened and never could have happened.
Brain activation, which must be powerful, and highly selective, can
account for some aspects – the hallucinatory imagery and the
associated movements, for example. But activation cannot account
for the bizarreness and the loss of logical reasoning. If brain

Rich and varied internal percepts, especially sensorimotor
(movement), auditory (drums), and anti-gravitational

Delusional acceptance of the wild events as real despite their
extreme improbability (a bike on a mountain peak?) and physical
impossibility (gliding weightless on a golf fairway?).

activation were global in REM sleep, we would expect orientation
and cognition to improve, not deteriorate. These changes must
result from something else, something that changes the whole
mode of operation of the brain and the mind. As we see in
Chapters 4 and 5, this change in mode is affected both chemically
and by selective brain deactivation. The net effect is that, in
dreaming (compared with waking), some mental functions are
enhanced while others are diminished. It’s as simple as that!
And every bit as complicated.

Does everyone dream?
All human beings who have been studied in sleep labs have

Dreaming

brain activation in sleep. Periods of brain activation during
sleep are associated with rapid eye movements in the sleeper.
These rapid eye movements give the brain-activated phase of
sleep its name: REM or rapid eye movement sleep. When
awakened at the time of intense clusters of rapid eye
movements, 95 per cent of sleepers studied in labs report
dreaming. From this evidence, it is generally assumed that
everyone does, in fact, dream in sleep; any impression to the
contrary is related to the difﬁculty recalling dreams.
If dreaming is not interrupted by awakening, it is rare to
have recall. Poor or no dream recall by many people is a
function of the abolition of memory during these brainactivated phases of sleep. As the chemical systems that are
responsible for recent memory are completely turned off
when the brain is activated during sleep, it is difﬁcult to have
recall unless an awakening occurs to restore the availability
of these chemicals to the brain.

10

How were dream data collected?
The reports that have been presented so far are all mine. They
were recorded at home or on the road in my personal journal, which
now runs to 116 volumes covering the last 25 years of my life and
includes over 300 dream reports. Dream reports such as these
have the great advantage of being easy and inexpensive to obtain,
numerous, and, to me at least, undeniably authentic. Even though I
have no recall of these dreams until I read the reports, I have the
reports and I see in them the striking formal features that I have
emphasized in this chapter.

Other dream journals
The best dream journal that I have found is called The Dream
Journal of the Engine Man. Its author was a railroad buff. I like it
because it was recorded in the summer of 1939 (when I was only six
years old) and could not therefore have been inﬂuenced by my
theories. I also like it because the descriptions are so detailed and so
free of interpretation. Some are even accompanied by simple but
expressive drawings. To control for the fact that the Engine Man,
like me, is male, we have collected journalistic reports from our
female colleagues and students. All show the same robust formal
differences from waking consciousness that I have emphasized here.

Sleep lab reports

and John Antrobus (City College of New York), and our own sleep

These reports do, however, have corresponding deﬁciencies, which
need to be overcome if dream science is to be universally valid. To
test the generality of the ﬁndings and to be sure that I wasn’t just
making up dreams to ﬁt my theory, we need to have reports from
many other sources and individuals, collected under very different
conditions. The dream data that we have analysed before arriving at
our conclusions have thus been taken from other dream journals,
sleep lab reports, and home-based reports.

lab team, we have over 1,000 reports that were collected by
experimentally awakening participants in studies.
We know that sleep lab awakenings change the character of the
reports in at least two ways.
1.

Dreaming

2.

They introduce thoughts, feelings, and percepts related to the
laboratory situation, but this has no effect on dream hallucinations,
delusions, or bizarreness.
They increase recall and the naturalism of the dream recalled.
For example, more positive emotion is found in post-awakening
reports, indicating that we normally sleep right through our
more pleasant dreams, whereas our unpleasant ones are
more likely to awaken us and tilt the scales towards negative
emotion.

A major disadvantage of sleep lab reports is that they are very
expensive to obtain and tend to come almost exclusively from
younger individuals. Students at the universities where the labs are
located are easily recruited. Finally, due to expense, they tend to be
limited in number of reports per participant. No one who is a sleep
lab participant can yet match the 256 reports of the Engine Man, or
my 300+ reports.

Home-based reports with physiological controls
With the hope of obtaining the best of both dream science
worlds, we have developed the Nightcap, a home-based sleep
monitor that allows us to know what state the participants
were in before their reports, to compare spontaneous
awakening with experimental awakening reports, to obtain
abundant data from each person, and, best of all, to obtain
reports in natural settings (Figure 1). Using this approach we
have been able to accomplish two feats that have never before
been attempted.
One is to obtain a very large number of reports from each of three

sleep conditions: sleep onset, NREM, and REM sleep. The other is
to obtain comparable reports from two states of waking by beeping
the same participants with a home pager during the daytime.
Thus, the same participants who give us dream reports also give
us reports of their waking consciousness. This last advantage is
crucial to our effort to extend our understanding of mental life
back into the waking state, and to obtain comparable quantitative
data from the minds of the same individuals when awake and
asleep.

Dreaming

Summary
It is ironic to note that the ﬁrst task of a science of the mind – to
describe, deﬁne, and measure polar states of consciousness such as
waking and dreaming – has only recently assumed a serious status.
Although artists and poets have long championed this approach
and have appropriately celebrated the differences between
conscious states, scientists have shied away from their study
because they had no objective measures of subjective experience
and because subjective experience was considered to be hard to
trust or deal with. But there is no substitute for a direct approach to
human consciousness, an approach that takes subjective experience
as data. Part of the solution to this problem is technical: we
now possess laboratory and ﬁeld methods for establishing the
parameters of brain correlation with mental experience. Another
part of the solution is conceptual: by focusing on the formal aspects
of mental states we remove the distractions and intractability of
enormous individual differences in mental content. As we see in
Chapter 2, most of the important differences between waking and
dreaming can be captured by formal analysis. Content analysis can
thus be unburdened from the impossible task of explaining the
formal differences between states of consciousness.

14

Chapter 2
Why did the analysis of
dream content fail to
become a science?

Although there were a few important predecessors of the formal
approach to dreaming described in Chapter 1, most dream
theorists preferred to focus on content. Impressed with the
apparent unintelligibility of dreams, these theorists assumed that
there was a rebus, or transformational set of rules (algorithm),
which presented the deeper meanings of the dream in disguised
symbolic, metaphorical, and sensory terms. Interpretation has
always been the main goal of content analysis, whether for
medical diagnosis (in the hands of the early Greeks), fortune
telling (in the work of Artemidorus), religious prophecy (in the
Bible), or psychological divinations (in the proto-scientiﬁc schema
of Sigmund Freud).
As he was so close to us in time and spirit, and because our
brain-based theory is so different from his, in this chapter we
focus on Freud’s psychoanalytic model as it was developed in
his Project for a Scientiﬁc Psychology (1895) and The Interpretation
of Dreams (1900). Freud wanted his psychology to have a solid
foundation in brain science, but he was 100 years too early to
build it as we now can. For this reason, he was forced to resort
to speculative philosophy, the medium of all pre-modern
dream theories that analyse content. The differences between
Freud’s content analytical scheme and modern theory are shown
in Table 1.

For all pre-modern analysts of dream content, the dream as it is
experienced by the dreamer is not what it appears to be; rather,
it is the distorted read-out of a sick body (Greek Onirodiagnosis),
or an encoded message about the future from the gods (whether
pagan as with Artemidorus or Judaeo-Christian as in the Bible).
Sigmund Freud picked up the distorted message idea and
acted as the high priest whose psychological skills could tell
the patient things that he would otherwise not know about himself.
All of these systems, including psychoanalysis, are essentially
religions in that they are based on faith in an agency that gives
16

hidden directives, which can be understood only through
the intervention of someone who can interpret the
‘message’.

At a deeper level, all schemes that analyse content are essentially
two-pronged: there are always two agencies – us and them, the
body and the spirit, the ego and the id, the brain and the mind.
Part of the change in paradigm exempliﬁed by the shift from
dream content to dream form is the adoption of the philosophical
conviction that the physical world is the only world that there
is, that the brain and the mind are therefore inextricably united,
and that dreaming is a distinctive form of conscious awareness
caused by the state of the brain in sleep. To be fair to Freud,
we must acknowledge that he really knew that these things
were true (or believed them as fervently as we do), but that
the interpretive tradition was too powerful and too tempting
for him to resist, especially as he knew next to nothing about
the brain.
Still, we can express our astonishment at the failure of so many
dream theorists to grasp the dream form theory. When Leonardo da
Vinci asked:
‘Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than when
awake?’
17

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

Nourishing these ideas was the general assumption that the
world and its people were created by, maintained by, and
beholden to a higher power, a god or gods that constituted
the ultimate agencies of earthly phenomena. While Freud was
an avowed atheist – his rejection of religion was practically
phobic – he fell back into the hidden agency idea with his belief
in a dynamic unconscious mind that was in constant competition
with consciousness. In dreaming, this competition became war-like,
so that the mind was forced to resort to extreme defences to avoid
being overwhelmed.

Can dreams foretell the future?
Since time immemorial, the mysterious nature of dreaming,
which we now know is determined mainly by its formal
qualities, has led people to believe that dreams were messages from the other world. Dreams have been regarded as
prophetic communications which, when properly decoded,
would enable us to foretell the future.
There is absolutely no scientiﬁc evidence for this theory and
considerable scientiﬁc evidence against it. It is certainly true
that individuals who are concerned about a traumatic event,
such as the threat of the loss of a loved one who is sick, will

Dreaming

dream about that loved one more than would otherwise be
the case. We know from our experiments on lucid dreaming
that it is possible to inﬂuence dream content simply by
having a subject in mind while going to sleep. Therefore,
dreaming about a loved one at a time when that loved one’s
life is threatened is not in the least bit surprising. If the
dreamer then calls and ﬁnds that the individual has died, it
is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream
was a premonition of that death. But this is a mistake. It is
simply a coincidental correspondence between a situation
about which one has legitimate and intense concern and the
occurrence of the event that one fears.
We can turn the question around and ask what constitutes
scientiﬁc proof of the occurrence of dreams that are premonitions (premonitory dreams). The answer is that we
would need to do what are called prospective studies, studies
in which many individuals are sampled in terms of their

18

dream life and judges who know nothing about the dreams
or individuals (i.e. are blinded) are asked to make predictions or correspondences between these dream events and
events that occurred in real life. A problem that arises here
is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams will
usually give one or two striking examples of ‘hits’, but they
never tell you how many premonitory dreams they had that
were not associated with the event that in fact occurred.
to establish some base of how commonly coincidental
correspondences occur between dream and waking reality.
Until we have that evidence, it is better to believe that the
assumption is false.

We would expect such a great genius to offer the speculative but
naturalistic answer:
‘Because the visual image production system of the brain is
selectively activated in sleep!’

And when Shakespeare ascribes to Bottom the recognition that ‘I
dreamed a dream so strange as to pass all understanding’, why
doesn’t he go on and close the circle by hypothesizing that:
‘Because the brain’s memory mechanisms are so seriously disrupted
during sleep we cannot escape bizarre mental experiences that
would otherwise occur only during madness.’

Indeed, the analogy with madness offers clues about the creation of
dreams by the brain precisely because the form of dreaming is very
much like certain kinds of madness. The combination of frequent
visual hallucinations (in the perceptual domain), instability of
orientation, and recent memory loss (in the cognitive domain)
19

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

To do a scientiﬁc study of dream prophecy, we would need

should have made physicians, such as Sigmund Freud and Carl
Jung, recognize that the mental illness that dreaming simulated
best was delirium, the psychosis associated with the acute brain
dysfunctions caused by toxicity (alcohol and drugs), anoxia
(inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain caused by circulation
deﬁciencies), and acute head trauma. Jung said, ‘Let the dreamer
awake and you will see psychosis.’ Fair enough. But what kind of
psychosis will you see? The fact that it is delirium should have
suggested that a major shift in brain function was necessary to
account for such a major change in mental state. We return to this
discussion in Chapter 7.

Dreaming

With regard to mental state, we need to note two important points:
one phenomenological, the other methodological.
For phenomenology, the term ‘mental state’ implies global
features: every aspect of mental activity changes when the
mental state changes. The easiest way to effect a global change
in mental state is to engineer a global change in brain state.
For methodology, the clinical assessment of mental state has
always been achieved by an examination known as the
mental status exam. Uniting neurology and psychiatry, the
mental status exam is a comprehensive checklist of mind
functions that are known to be disrupted by organic brain disease,
i.e. brain disease caused by a physical rather than a mental
condition.
To introduce the far-reaching implications of dream science to a
general science of consciousness, consider the following categories
of the mental status exam:
•
•
•
•
•

Consciousness: clear or clouded?
Attention: focused or distractible?
Intellectual: sharp functions or dull?
Perceptions: externally driven or hallucinated?
Cognition: logical or illogical?
20

•
•
•

Emotion: stable or unstable/uncontrolled?
Memory: good or poor?
Abstraction: symbolic or concrete?

Even this very incomplete list makes us realize how careless we have
been in not applying the mental state concept to dreaming and the
mental status approach to its analysis.
Below is another report that will help us see the global nature of
mental state changes in dreaming:

I am trying to organize a group for a departure. I ﬁnd one member
at the foot of a hill, near some water. I urge him to go up the hill to a
rendezvous point for departure.
Suddenly, or perhaps always, he is in a red car, which runs along
beside me up the hill. The peculiar thing is that the front of the car,
including the driver, is underground. Yet its trajectory is smooth
and the ground is unbroken!
As we climb, the car moves ahead of me and I make a strong but
vain effort to keep up with its progress. The car then crosses from

21

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

9/3/1981 Red Car, Dream no. 16

left to right and runs – still half underground – into a wall. I wonder
if the driver will have hurt his head in the crash.
The scene changes.
I am in a locker room and approach my son Ian who has been
hurt. At ﬁrst his legs appear to have been amputated at the knees
and I feel dread. But as I approach, what I took to be stumps are his
blood-smeared kneecaps (very bright red blood – like the car – and

Dreaming

he is smiling, not crying). I am relieved and wake up.

My consciousness is clear as a bell. In fact, I see – and feel –everything
in this dream with a surreal intensity that would have pleased André
Breton as much as Leonardo da Vinci. The intense hallucinatory
percepts grip my attention in a vice that won’t let it do anything else
but watch in fascination – and in horror – as the half-buried car
hurtles uphill and crashes despite my effort to control it. The
emotions of horror and dread ( fear) survive the scene shift – to the
locker room – where I am relieved to ﬁnd that my son is OK. Although
it is not explicitly noted, my cognition is defective and my logical
reasoning poor. How could the car do what it appeared to do and
without disrupting the ground? ‘Seeing is believing’ is one answer.
My Red Car dream reveals another kind of association – one
marked by a high degree of emotional salience. My son, Ian, was
badly injured in an automobile accident and one of his legs
was threatened and saved. So it is natural for my memory of
associations – associative memory – to link the red car crash to my
son, Ian. But (and it is a large but) I do not see Ian in the hospital
setting where I actually beheld him at the time of his accident. And
he had only one leg damaged, not two. This departure of the dream
scenario from long-term memory of personal experiences, called
episodic memory in psychological terminology, is typical and needs
to be explained. Episodic memory may feed dream content useful
fragments for plot construction, but it does not supply the details
that are, in waking, so easily remembered. Why? What is going on?
We should not ignore cases like this because there is nothing less at
stake than how memory works. This means that dream science is a
22

set of rules for understanding unconscious aspects of memory
formation, but not in the sense intended by theorists who analyse
dream content.

And what about thinking? We already know that thinking is
suppressed in dreaming and that it is only slightly effective when it
does appear.
Among the generally unsung heroes of the dream form theory,
brain state = mental state, looms the Romantic Movement ﬁgure of
David Hartley, who lived at the turn of the 19th century, famous as
the father of British Associationism. Associationism asserts that
memory is organized according to categorical similarities among
objects, people, ideas, and so on, to every category of content.
A good example, from my Richard Newland dream in Chapter 1,
is the associative linking of spray painting with sulphating of
grapevines. Although the purposes are very different, the processes
are similar – to cover a large surface area with liquid, it is useful
to turn the liquid into tiny particles and to spread these via a
pressurized vapour system. Another example, in the Red Car
23

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

Extending the suggestions of Chapter 1, dream science now needs
much more careful consideration of the numerous subcategories
of mental state. A list of such subcategories and the ways that
neurobiology explains them are given in Table 2. Having stumbled,
almost by accident, on the now obvious fact that the bizarreness of
dreams is a reﬂection of orientational instability, we want to know
much more about other memory functions. Are declarative and/or
episodic memories used in dream plot constructions? To what
extent and with what constraints? The terms ‘declarative’ and
‘episodic’ refer to speciﬁc memories of personal or historical
events, e.g. I went to Boston last weekend. This kind of memory
is contrasted with ‘semantic’ memory, which consists of general
facts, e.g. Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. Another class
of memory is ‘procedural’, e.g. I know how to drive my car
to Boston.

What caused the failure of psychoanalytic
dream theory?
Freud must have had in mind the fragmentary nature involved in
incorporating episodic memory when he coined the term ‘day
residue’ and dubbed it the dream stimulus. Subsequent scientiﬁc

Dreaming

work on memory sources of dreams has shown, however, that even
this notion is mistaken. In Tore Nielsen’s data, the incorporation of
conﬁdently identiﬁed memory sources is actually low for the day
immediately preceding a given night’s dream; it becomes higher as
one moves backwards in time to a peak at day 6 before dreaming. In
the French neurophysiologist Michel Jouvet’s dream data, the peak
of incorporation is 7 days before the dream and never includes
content from locales to which he has just travelled, a surprise even
for theories that emphasize emotional salience, as well as those that
emphasize recency.
Freud’s work suffered from two fatal scientiﬁc defects, which his
brilliant rhetoric could not overcome. One was the absence of
relevant brain science, which he knew was indispensable and
would some day force revision of his theories. For this he cannot be
blamed. He was a creature of his time and his ambition pushed him
a century ahead of that time. But because Freud was trained as a
biological scientist, we can in all fairness ask why he was so careless
as an observer. Why were his data so limited? Why was his focus so
narrowly ﬁxed?
As far as the data are concerned, Freud made no attempt to collect
dream reports from people other than himself, and even those
reports are few in number (about 40 are cited in the 700 pages of
his Interpretation of Dreams) and fragmentary (his word counts, of
less than 100, are many times less than most modern samples). In
the 1890s, as today, it was an easy matter to collect an extensive,
representative sample and to treat the data-set as a whole rather
than using the piecemeal, axe-grinding, controversial technique
that Freud used to discuss each one.
Freud’s scholarship is evident in his detailed discussion of the
scientiﬁc literature before 1900. However, he is controversial and
exclusive rather than dispassionate and balanced in discussing the
work of others. In many cases, his derisive dismissals seem justiﬁed,
but, for one who was sure that the brain was important, he is
26

cavalier in his treatment of such intellectual giants as Wilhelm
Wundt (who correctly assumed that the dreaming brain would
show a selective increase in some of its functions, e.g. vision, and a
selective decrease in others, e.g. memory and reasoning). For Freud,
the idea that any dream content was nonsensical, i.e. gratuitously
associative, was anathema. He therefore thought that Wundt’s
suggestion that the bizarre nature of dreams reﬂects a delirious
series of links of loosely connected contents must be wrong.

The second great predecessor was Wundt’s teacher, Herman
Helmholtz, who also inspired Freud’s own mentor, Herman Muller,
and helped to create the anti-vitalist spirit of the age in which
Freud’s theory took root. In discussing dreaming in his classic
Physiological Optics, Helmholtz was a formalist in his approach to
hallucinated movement. As Helmholtz noticed, the sense of the self
moving through the dream space is one of the most robust formal
features of dreaming. When today we refer to ‘sensorimotor
hallucinations’ we are only echoing Helmholtz’s recognition that
the dreaming brain is capable of simulating acts of movement
(motor acts) extremely convincingly. Helmholtz recognized that this
meant that motor control – in waking – must be highly predictive.
More speciﬁcally he theorized that the nervous system created its
own image of the expected consequence of movement.
This principle has become enshrined in movement physiology as
27

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

Freud ignored two important predecessors. One was David Hartley,
who ascribed the bizarre nature of dreams to too many associations;
he had a functional theory to go with his hypothesis, a hypothesis
that was probably correct. Dreaming, for Hartley, served to loosen
associations that were otherwise inclined to become obsessively
ﬁxed. ‘And that would be madness,’ Hartley asserted. Certainly,
dreaming is a hyperassociative state (i.e. a state in which many,
many associations are made), as Freud could have quickly
determined had he examined dream reports before rushing to
interpret them.

Dreaming

the ‘efferent copy hypothesis’. If, and only if, we are able to predict,
and project, an image of movement outcomes are we able to move
effectively. The almost magical ease of dream movement (witness
my weightless gliding and the ﬂight patterns of lucid dreamers)
is due to this self-contained, closed-loop activation, in sleep, of
movement patterns that are felt by us to be complete and have an
outcome. This, of course, implies activation of generators of motor
patterns in the brain, for which there is now abundant evidence.
The best that poor old Freud could do with ﬂying dreams was to
argue that they represented displaced sexual desire. Freud’s
rebus, you will recall, was that unconscious wishes – and sexual
wishes needed to be kept unconscious – escaped the censor’s
denunciation when the ego was weakened by sleep. If the now
free-to-be-expressed sexual impulses were not disguised, by the
pleasurable but not sexual hallucination of ﬂying, the dreamer
would be awakened by the consciousness of these forbidden desires.
Freud never mentioned his own sexual dreams. Perhaps he never
had any – or never remembered them. But this is unlikely. And any
research participant – or any of his patients – could have told him
that sexual dreams, complete with orgasm, occur in the very same
people who enjoy ﬂying dreams.
The kind of argument that I am now advancing is dismissed
as Freud-bashing by the many, still passionate defenders
of psychoanalysis. It is true that I want to discredit Freud
emphatically, but only because we are all still in danger of accepting
subsequent psychological explanations for dream phenomena that
are likely to have physiological mechanisms with quite different
psychological meanings from those that we can now imagine. For
example, we might experience exotic movement, including sexual
movement, in dreams in order to refresh movement programmes
that are crucial to survival. We might also regard dreams as efforts
to revise those programmes in terms of emotionally salient or
important memories. Thus, my son’s accident is an important
aspect of my bicycle dream. In fact, he had another terrible accident
28

on a bicycle before we stopped him from riding with his own
impaired motor control system. Ian’s bike accident is ﬁxed in my
memory as a warning: this could happen again to him and to me.

Can associations ever really be free?

Freud’s idea that he could avoid suggesting content by laying a
client down on a couch (encouraging a pre-sleep relaxation) and
sitting behind him or her (to remove any personal impact) seems
grossly naı̈ve in retrospect. Sleep onset is a particularly fruitful state
for the elaboration of fantasy and dream-like mental activity that
incorporated local conditions shamelessly. And any patient,
hysterical or not, would know – by 1910 at the very latest – what
Freud expected in the way of ‘associations’. Now that the false
memory phenomenon is so well known, it is easy for us to see what
mischief Freud’s ‘scientiﬁc’ precautions must have cost him. To
avoid repeating these mistakes, we need to be much more critical,
and much more versatile, than Freud was.
One way to free the formal approach to dreaming for immunity
29

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

Associations are not associations unless they have meaningful
connections. The meaning of their connection is determined
as much by the context in which they are evoked as by their
historical source. So, just as Freud, the atheist, was doomed by
his authoritarian speculations to create a new religion of which he
was the highest of priests, so he was destined to suggest certain
associations for the dream content of his clients, even as he tried
desperately to distance himself from hypnosis and the criticism of
suggestibility. This was particularly true of his work with hysterical
patients, whose highly hypnotizable nature he recognized. And he
knew from his experience at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris in
1885, that the neurologists Pierre Janet and Jean-Martin Charcot
were able to get whatever result they wanted from their hysterical
patients, especially in the theatrical context of medical teaching
amphitheatres.

from the charge of self-fulﬁlling prophecy is to keep our mind
genuinely open with respect to psychological meaning, to resist
any formulaic approach to interpretation, and to refuse any
interpretation that is not straightforward and tied to physiology.
This means that we have to settle for less than Freud wanted. As
made clear in Chapter 11, there remain many aspects of dreaming
that we cannot explain today, although, as this book attempts to
show, many aspects of dream content can be explained today using
the formal approach. Those that cannot be explained will have to
wait. But, with the ﬁeld moving as fast as it is today, the wait will not
be long, and it will be worthwhile because we will ﬁnally obtain
what Freud could only dream of: a psychology that is perspicacious
and free from doubt.

Dreaming

Brain–mind isomorphism and the science
of dreaming
The word ‘isomorphism’ means similarity of form or shape, and
brain–mind isomorphism that every form of mental activity has a
similar form of brain activity. Therefore, if we detect a dream form,
we can seek a corresponding brain form. In dreaming, the simplest
example is activation. To explain the awakening of the mind in sleep
we should expect to ﬁnd a similar (but not of course identical)
awakening of the brain during sleep. As we see in Chapter 3, we do
ﬁnd this – the brain is electrically activated in sleep and, when this
happens, the mind is turned on too. Naturally. It’s that simple.
A more detailed example should clinch our point. If, in our
exploration of the brain in sleep, we ﬁnd physiological evidence that
memory systems are disabled, we should expect to ﬁnd that
memory is altered during dreaming and that dreams would be
difﬁcult to recall. We already know that the second prediction is
true, but just how true we cannot yet say precisely. The ﬁrst
prediction has, however, scarcely been entertained. Is it generally
true that I cannot exercise my episodic memory when I am
dreaming? Does this affect dream content?
30

31

Why did the analysis of dream content fail to become a science?

These examples are chosen to highlight two important points about
the doctrine of brain–mind isomorphism. One is that it is just as
fruitful to map from the brain to the mind as it is to map from the
mind to the brain. The second is that we must choose carefully
the appropriate level of each domain at which to focus our
isomorphic efforts. In the beginning, and we are still very much at
the beginning, we will ﬁnd that global and psychologically general
levels will be more generous than detailed and psychologically
personal ones. Individual differences have never been generous to
psychology. And how many of them are real? Although it may
disappoint you if you hanker after a fortune-telling interpretation
of your dreams, our attention to the mirrored formal aspects is
necessary to the scientiﬁc understanding of dreaming as a universal
process. Later in this book we will see how it can be used to help
individual dream interpretation by relieving it of an impossibly
difﬁcult task and helping us to discover the usually clear emotional
salience of our dreams.

Chapter 3
How is the brain activated
in sleep?

Consciousness is so rapidly and dramatically reduced during sleep
that it was natural to assume that the brain simply turned off at
sleep onset and turned on again just before awakening. Indeed,
some people do sleep all night in that deep, oblivious, and
uninterrupted way. Some, but by no means all. And no one sleeps
that way all the time. There are periods of life change and stress
when mental activity seems to go on all night. Are these to be
attributed to our not really being able to sleep at such times?
Perhaps. But what about dreaming? How could such elaborate
and exciting mental activity arise in an inactive brain?
This question was answered in a wide variety of erroneous ways.
As dream recall was generally poor and needed awakening to be
present at all, many scientists – Sigmund Freud among them –
wrongly assumed that dreaming occurred only in the instant before
awakening. Now it is certainly true that dreaming can occur just
before awakening. And we have already noted that dreaming can
be so unpleasantly exciting as to provoke awakening, leading to
another erroneous assumption: that all dreams are unpleasantly
exciting, i.e. all dreams are characterized by negative emotions such
as anger, anxiety, or fear.
Another erroneous theory was that dreaming arose in response to
external sensory stimuli that were strong enough to activate the
32

brain, but not strong enough to produce arousal. Again it is true
that train whistles, indigestion, and spouses coming home late can
inﬂuence dream content. But they often don’t, and dreaming
doesn’t depend on such stimuli even when they do gain entry to
the sleeping brain.

Why did it take so long to discover brain activation
in sleep?
We are inclined to assume that it is the slow progress of
technological development that impeded scientiﬁc advances in
studying dreaming. But this is a face-saving sop for those who were
so conceptually blinded that they could not imagine the simple
experiments that could have led to the brain activation conclusion.
As Michel Jouvet shows in his novel Château du Rève, most of our
vaunted twentieth-century discoveries about sleep could have been
made earlier by the most useful scientiﬁc instrument of all: direct
observation. The direct observability of sleep is especially easy to
achieve in our infants and children, the very individuals who most
dramatically reveal the brain activation of rapid eye movement
(REM) in their behaviour.

How is the brain activated in sleep?

It turns out that most dreaming occurs under the calm cover
of sleep and is the result of a built-in mechanism of brain
activation that operates in all of us every night of our lives. It
is the goal of this chapter to explain how the brain activation
of sleep was discovered and how it gradually initiated the
paradigm shift, or change in strategy, from dream content to
dream form that has been the subject of my ﬁrst two chapters.
Before beginning our story, it is important to appreciate that,
just as it took a full half-century (1900–53) to recognize the
reality of brain activation in sleep, it has taken another half-century
(1953–2003) for us to come to terms with this discovery. And there
are still many die-hards who refuse to relinquish the hopeless
fantasy of the total power of interpretation offered by dream
content analysis.

Dreaming

And it almost happened, although never quite. Instead of simply
observing sleepers – and seeing with one’s own eyes the periodic
occurrence of small facial and eye movements, as well as mufﬂed
cries, penile erection, ﬂaccid muscle tone, depressed spinal reﬂexes,
and a host of other autonomic or self-regulating measures (take
respiratory rate for a simple example) – those few scientists who
were interested enough to perform anything faintly resembling
a sleep or dream experiment interfered with the sleep of the
participants in their studies. It was the induction of dreaming that
these scholars, most of whom were French, were interested in.
Could they induce a participant to dream of a certain odour by
opening a perfume bottle under his or her nose? The answer
was yes, as they found out, but it was very, very difﬁcult.
And, meanwhile, they missed the chance to observe
natural sleep.
We must admit that staying up all night observing other people
sleeping is not everyone’s idea of fun. It requires unusual
motivation and a modicum of self-discipline, even if one is tempted
by the prospect of discovery. If Freud had only imagined that dream
behaviour could be observed – he was certainly motivated enough
to do it – he would quickly have realized that all he needed to do to
be a sharp observer was to sleep in the daytime. His phobic concern
about suggestion could have been further quieted by the premium
placed upon doing nothing but watching.
But, in reality, it’s even easier than that. For anyone to observe REM
sleep behaviour directly, it can be done with bed partners, especially
in the wee hours of the morning, most conveniently on vacation, in
the summer time when the hillock of the cornea can be seen in the
early dawn light to glide to and fro under the closed – or perhaps
half-open – eyelids. The eyelids themselves dance and twitch
sporadically and, when they do, one has only to give a light tap on
the shoulder and ask what is going on in the mind. Informed
consent is as admirable in these informal conditions as it is in
university sleep labs, but don’t let that stop you.
34

If you don’t have a willing bed partner, you can observe your big
sister’s baby or anyone’s pet cat or dog, and have the same thrill of
discovery. Of course you can’t expect an answer if you ask them if
they are dreaming. But you can answer that question for yourself
now that you know that the REMs that give brain-activated sleep its
most popular name are a direct readout of the internal activation.
Not that dreaming occurs exclusively in REM sleep. It doesn’t.
REM sleep just happens to provide the most ideal condition for its
occurrence.

The electroencephalogram and the sleep lab
Neurophysiologists were every bit as slow as psychologists to move
dream science forwards. They knew about reﬂexes but they didn’t
know about spontaneous activation. Instead they assumed that the
brain was as dependent on stimulation for all of its activated states
as was the mind in sleep.
Two of the greatest minds in the history of science studied reﬂexes
and believed that mental activity was stimulus-dependent. The
Nobel Laureate Charles Sherrington argued, forcefully, that the
reﬂex was the functional unit of the brain. He never really listened
to his imaginative student, Thomas Graham Brown, who tried to
35

How is the brain activated in sleep?

In Chapter 4, we take up the question about the dreaming brain
that, so far, only our animal collaborators can answer; in Chapter 5,
we consider the implication for the development of the abundant,
ﬂorid REM sleep of all mammalian newborns. My point here is
simple and descriptive. The ﬁrst step of any natural history
endeavour is to observe (quietly and carefully) and to record one’s
observations (thoroughly and systematically). It is as embarrassing
as it is instructive that this was never done by anyone aspiring to
either sleep or dream science before 1930. How many other
breakthrough discoveries now elude us because we are conceptually
boxed in by gratuitous assumptions that there is nothing to observe
and/or that we can obviate direct observation via intuition or
speculation?

Dreaming

convince Sherrington that it was the spontaneous activity of paired
‘half-centres’ that set the stage for reﬂex responsiveness. The basic
difference between Sherrington’s reﬂex and Graham Brown’s
half-centre concept is that the reﬂex brain was completely
dependent upon external stimuli, unlike the half-centre brain
which was capable of spontaneous activity. Sherrington made the
mistake of assuming from his own conscious experience that his
brain simply turned off when he went to sleep.
Ivan Pavlov, justiﬁably famous for showing that reﬂexes can be
conditioned, shared Sherrington’s assumption that the mind was
blank in sleep (wrong!) because the brain was inactive (wrong
again!) and unstimulated (wrong once again!). As we see in
Chapter 4, it was not until well after the discovery of REM sleep
that the activation of the nerve elements known as neurons
(neuronal activation) was shown to be continuous in sleep. This
means that our brains never turn off completely, and hence they are
always capable of some level of mental activity, even if waking and
dream consciousness both depend on a robust level of brain
activation.
Electrophysiology began to correct the picture in 1928 when
the German psychiatrist Adolf Berger succeeded in recording
brain waves from the surface of his patients’ heads using an
ampliﬁcation and recording device that came to be known as the
electroencephalograph (or EEG). The EEG revolutionized sleep and
dream science as much as it altered clinical neurology because it
provided an objective tool for assessing dynamic brain activity in
normal individuals as well as in patients with epilepsy. Figure 2
illustrates an EEG, together with other variables used in modern
sleep science. Against great scepticism that his so-called ‘brain
waves’ were artefacts of movement or muscle activity, Berger won
the day when he showed that the EEG underwent distinctive
changes in sleep. To cut a long story short, behavioural sleep was
invariably associated with a tendency for the brain waves to slow (in
frequency) and to increase (in amplitude). This change marks
36

the onset of what we now call slow wave or non-REM (NREM)
sleep.
It wasn’t long before the EEG was used to study sleep in the
forerunners of today’s sleep labs. The capacity to record
physiological variables has grown so dramatically in the twentieth
century that we tend to forget how simple the early devices were,
and how startling the discoveries made with them. Today’s
‘polygraphs’ are all direct descendants of Berger’s baby, a gloriﬁed

and REM sleep have behavioural, polygraphic, and psychological
manifestations. The sequence of these stages is represented in the
polygraph channel. Sample tracings of three variables used to
distinguish state are also shown: electromyogram (EMG), which is
highest in waking, intermediate in NREM sleep, and lowest in REM

which are both activated in waking and REM sleep and inactivated in
NREM sleep. Each sample is approximately 20 seconds.

voltmeter that can raise the power of electrical signals three orders
of magnitude from the microvolt (thousandth of a volt) range on the
surface of the body to the volt range of the recorders. Variations on
the theme of EEG are its better-known predecessors, the
electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the heart’s activity, and
its two offspring, the electro-oculogram (EOG), which measures eye
movement, and the electromyogram (EMG), which measures
muscle tone.

Dreaming

How was brain activation in sleep discovered?
It was the combination of EEG and EOG that enabled Eugene
Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman to make their 1953 discovery of
brain activation in sleep. They called the brain activation phase of
sleep REM (for rapid eye movements) because of the association of
the activation of the eye movements (oculomotor activation) with
activation of the brain. They asserted that dreaming might be
another associated event. It was the EMG (together with the EEG
and EOG) that allowed Michel Jouvet and François Michel to show
that muscle tone supporting posture – and hence postural
movement – was actively abolished in REM sleep.
Before 1953, it was recognized that sleep was not uniform/
intractable, any more than it was inert. In other words, electrical
patterns of brain-wave activity changed continuously, denoting
both global and local ﬂows of brain activation. It was assumed,
erroneously, that only the intense brain activation of REM was
capable of sustaining dreaming. As the REM periods occurred
periodically at 90-minute intervals and occupied 1.5 to 2 hours per
night, this seemed like more than enough time to accommodate
dreaming. It is certainly many times more than the instant before
awakening.
It turns out, however, that dreaming can also occur at sleep onset
(no surprise because the EEG is still relatively activated) and in
other phases of so-called NREM sleep, especially late night stage II
38

Do we dream in black and white or in
colour?
Modern lab evidence suggests strongly that we dream in
colour. To what, then, do we attribute the common misperception that dreaming occurs in black and white? The
answer is very clear – it is the poor memory. Recall of dreaming is a function not only of brain activation in sleep but also
of awakening conditions, which determine whether dreams
will be recalled at all, whether they will be recalled clearly,
and whether they will be recalled at length. In all clear,
dream in colour. In our thousands of lab dream reports,
there is not a single instance of a well-recalled dream being
in black and white, as would be expected if this were indeed
normally the case.

sleep when the brain is almost as active as in REM sleep, often
called stage I. That leaves stages III and IV, which occur early in
the night and are considerably less likely to be associated with
dreaming.
The point of this introduction to sleep lab science is to show that,
although technology was not really necessary to describe dreaming
scientiﬁcally or to describe sleep behaviourally (because both could
have been done via careful direct observation), it was indispensable
in showing that brain activity is continuous – and continuously
variable – in sleep.

Who discovered REM and the EEG sleep cycle?
Eugene Aserinsky was interested in studying attention in children,
so sleep was a nuisance to him because, no matter how hard he tried

to keep them alert, sleep invariably took over the minds of his young
participants. As many teachers of the young have seen, Aserinsky
noticed that when his participants’ attention ﬂagged their eyes
tended to close. He therefore decided to put electrodes near the
childrens’ eyes in order to record their eye movements while they
were awake, and this helped. Aserinsky was, however, astonished to
discover that, when his young participants ﬁnally succumbed to
sleep, their eyes darted back and forth and up and down behind
their closed lids. He had inadvertently discovered REM sleep – and
the ﬁrst participant was his seven-year-old son Armand. Aserinsky
was a persistent scientist but he was also just plain lucky. Why?
Because REM occurs at sleep onset only in children!
As Louis Pasteur opined, ‘In the ﬁeld of observation chance favours
the prepared mind’. When Aserinsky reported his observations to
Kleitman, his mentor recognized their signiﬁcance for a science of
dreaming. By extending this observation on the eyes into sleep, and
by recording the EEG and the heart and respiratory rates in adults,
Aserinsky and Kleitman were able to observe the regular ebb and
ﬂow of activation affecting the brain, the eyes, the heart, and even
breathing throughout sleep. When this activation was maximal –
with a wake-like EEG, clusters of REMs, rapid heart action, and
fast, shallow breathing – awakenings yielded long, complex dream
reports, similar to the one below.
11/7/1981 Country House in Winter, Dream no. 19
We are at a country house in winter, like the farm in East Burke but
different. K.D.K. is there and we are skiing. I am looking, with a
sexual motive, for A.T. whom I have not seen for at least 20 years
and whom I never loved. She may be upstairs in this home, which
may or may not be mine. The second ﬂoor is reached by climbing a
twisted wooden shaft with inadequate branch-like steps. It is a
struggle. When I pull myself up – noting that the heating is on and
therefore that the house must be inhabited – I ﬁnd myself in the
arms of a sleeping J.C.
J.C. suddenly wakes up – with a look of not-surprising terror on
40

self-protective fear as he struggles to decide if I am I, and if I am
real. This all happens in an intense instant, summarizing all of the
emotional complexity of our relationship. I try to reassure him
saying, ‘J.C., it’s me, I love you.’ And. . . .

Dreams with frankly sexual themes such as this one are relatively
rare in sleep lab settings, where being the content is more likely to
reﬂect concern about sleeping while being observed and being
subjected to awakening. (In fact, this dream occurred when I was
on a trip to China and sleeping in a hotel in Guangzhou, of which
there is not the faintest record in my dream.) The dream is,
however, typical of those reported after awakenings from REM
sleep, whether in the sleep lab using the Aserinsky–Kleitman
theory, at home using our portable Nightcap monitoring system,
or in hotels in Guangzhou, China.

rotten because I quickly adapt to the succession of slides of large
slabs of the cliff side. Each time I take a step, some of the granite
falls away. These huge chunks of rock make not a sound as they fall,
out of view, to my left. Finally, with relief, I am at the summit,
which is a grill-like threshold on to which I level myself with two
hands. I thank my benefactress – hostess (C.?) for having prepared
me to cope with this hazardous ascent.

The universal characteristics that this REM sleep dream evinces are
intense frequent hallucinations (called hallucinosis in psychology) –
in this case the climbing movements are all perilously gripping –
and a complete lack of self-reﬂective awareness. The setting is
typically indeﬁnite: it is my house but not really; the characters are
vaguely deﬁned – in this case particularly C.; emotions such as fear
and elation are strong.
It is as if my brain were activated in a particular, selective way to
form hallucinations and emotions that are sensorimotor
(coordinating perception and action) in character, causing these
elements to be combined in a completely novel but personally
meaningful way. This is the ‘synthesis’ part of the dream process
42

that Robert McCarley and I wanted to identify in our 1977
activation–synthesis thesis. In Chapter 5, we learn more about
evidence for this hypothesis, which can come through the
application of imaging techniques to sleep and dream science.

In retrospect, the failure of this ambitious theory is not surprising:
it never worked very well in waking either. It perpetuates the notion
of the philosopher and psychologist William James, who held that
emotion was the perception of peripheral physiology (e.g. anxiety
occurs when I sense my rapid heart rate). This idea was discredited
and eclipsed by Walter Cannon and Philip Bard’s centralist theory
of emotion, which says that the feelings that we have are a function
of selective activation of that part of the brain known as the limbic
brain (see Figure 11); they may then be associated with a wide
variety of peripheral physiological changes.
An even more serious disconnection between dream psychology
and brain physiology was threatened. When ﬁrst David Foulkes,
and later many other psychologists, reported that dreaming could
be associated with almost any EEG stage of sleep, they reached the
unlikely conclusion that the mental activity of dreams had nothing
to do with sleep neurophysiology. Believe it or not, this mind–brain
dissociation hypothesis is still passionately defended. Needless to
43

How is the brain activated in sleep?

During the early days of the sleep lab era (about 1953–75), the goal
was to establish correlations between details of the dream plot, as
described by participants, and details of physiology, as described by
the EEG or polygraph. I call this the strong one-to-one isomorphic
hypothesis, which attempts to link mental activity to peripheral
physiology in real time. The goal was not achieved. Thus, early
claims that the eye movements of REM sleep could be predicted
from the sequence of directional changes in the dreamer’s
hallucinated gaze could not be substantiated. Although dream
content did occasionally reﬂect the sudden increases and decreases
of respiratory efforts, as would be expected in turning, talking, or
painting, more often it did not.

Dreaming

say, most of those who held these views were the disappointed
champions of strong content analysis; some were even die-hard
Freudians, and none was a practitioner of physiological sleep
science.
Among the many compelling reasons to reject the assertion of
brain–mind dissociation is the still overwhelming evidence that
REM sleep is the most favourable base for fully realized and
sustained dreaming; that NREM sleep is at best only half as
favourable; that sleep onset is even less so; and that while awake,
dreaming is essentially impossible. At this stage of our scientiﬁc
knowledge all we can say is that dreaming is increasingly probable
if the several brain conditions of REM sleep are present. The
psychological counterpart of this correlation is given by
the formal analysis and not content analysis of dreams. In
dream reports we therefore seek to measure the degree to which
they are hallucinatory (not what is seen) or thoughtful (not what
is thought).

What is the biology of sleep and dream science?
Meanwhile, even as the dream debate grew fractious and became
sterile, the sleep lab was unearthing a treasure trove of physiological
ﬁndings of great interest to dream science, as well as to behavioural
biology generally. The Aserinsky–Kleitman discovery was made in
1953, the same year that Watson and Crick published their epochal
double-helix model for DNA. There are two important implications
of this coincidence. One is that biology came of molecular age at the
same moment that dream science came of physiological age. In
the subsequent half-century, biology has changed beyond
recognition – in fact, it is now in danger of becoming nothing
but the molecular biology of the gene.
Sleep and dream science, meanwhile, has only begun to approach
molecular biology in terms of either conceptual ideas or
methodology. This is both because the descriptive task of sleep
44

and dream science was so enormous and because the concepts that
were drawn into the ﬁeld, especially from psychology, were not
equal to the scientiﬁc opportunities presented. Not everyone,
even today, wants to make mental activity physical. Too many
cultural and private belief systems are threatened by the idea that
consciousness in dreaming, as in waking, is a brain function. The
immortality of the soul is a prime example. If the brain dies, doesn’t
the mind die with it?

The burden of proof now falls clearly, and heavily, on those who
maintain that an awareness of dream content actually helps us. For
example, I am enlightened by ﬁnding through recall of Dream no.
19 that my psychosexual conﬂicts with a former friend and his wife
are still alive in my mind. But, even if my interpretation of this
dream is correct, how does it help me to know this fact? By making
me aware that yes, after all, there is an unconscious, or that yes,
after all, sexuality is polymorphous and ambiguous – that despite
superﬁcial appearances to the contrary, all is not entirely kosher in
Hobson’s unconscious mind.
Such sophistication might endear me to my psychoanalytic
45

How is the brain activated in sleep?

One idea that the biological revolution in dream science forces
us to take seriously is that, although it constitutes an undeniably
interesting and informative state of altered consciousness,
dreaming has no particular function in and of itself. As conscious
experience, dreaming is nothing but our occasional awareness of
brain activation in sleep. In this view, it is the brain activation
underlying REM sleep itself that performs the vaunted functions of
dreaming: establishing psychic equilibrium, integrating recent and
past learning, casting our inventory of personal information in
emotionally salient (or relevant) terms. All of these important
functions can and certainly must be performed whether or not we
are aware of them. If they depended on our conscious awareness of
dreaming, we would be in big trouble – especially those who have
no dream recall whatsoever.

Dreaming

brethren, leading to a wider acceptance of my ideas, increased book
royalties, and even referral of patients. Thus, my physical survival as
well as my intellectual procreation could be enhanced. But it seems
far more likely that I would do as well, or better, if I never had my
spiral staircase dream or, rather, never recalled and therefore never
interpreted it – the ‘dream work’, if any, is done unbeknownst to me,
by REM sleep and its friends in my unconscious brain.
This is just the kind of ‘reductionism’ that psychologist opponents
of physiologically based dream theory fear. Foulkes has argued
passionately against what he perceives to be ‘physiology’s effort to
take the problem of dreaming off of psychology’s hands’. To some
extent he is correct. If the main formal features of dreaming can be
shown to be physiologically determined, then content analysis does
not have to account for them. Instead of lamenting this situation,
however, dream psychology could do well to breathe a heavy sigh
of relief at seeing this onerous burden lifted. Freud himself was
pushed to the psychoanalytic wall in trying to explain dream
hallucinosis as a psychological defence. His effort to explain poor
dream memory in terms of active repression (rather than simple
amnesia) was equally forced. Worst of all, his effort to account for
dream emotion in terms of either wish fulﬁlment or disguise fell ﬂat
on its face because so many dreams contain unpleasant negative
affect and because so many are undisguised.
Reductionism was Freud’s strong suit. He tried to explain, as
all would-be scientists do, the greatest number of variables in
terms of the fewest assumptions. In hitting upon his wish
fulﬁlment–disguise censorship model he was reductionist in
the extreme. Every steeple is a phallus. Every dimple is a vagina.
The problem is that Freud’s reductionism was wrong, and it was
wrong, in large part, because he did not observe behaviour, measure
neurological function, or collect dreams systematically using the
mind-set and tools of natural science.
Now, we have the facts of human sleep physiology. Now, we know –
46

beyond the shadow of a doubt – that our consciousness in waking,
sleeping, or dreaming is a brain function. It is high time to move on
and to create the great, bold, and neurobiologically based theory to
which Freud himself aspired. Reductionism cannot explain away
phenomena. Dreaming will always be vivid, bizarre, emotional,
unreasonable, and hard to remember. But how (the question of
mechanism) and why (the question of function) may be explored
scientiﬁcally using physiological tools. As content analytical dream
theory reveals, it is the danger of circularity that has given
subjectivity a bad name. Now we have a brave new world of
scientiﬁc dream theory in which circularity can be transcended
and dreaming can still be enjoyed, discussed, and interpreted.

47

How is the brain activated in sleep?

In this chapter, we take seriously the idea that it is REM sleep that
constitutes the ideal physiological conditions for dreaming, and
attempt to use the data collected in cellular and molecular level
studies of sleep in animals to answer the how and why questions of
dreaming in greater detail.

Chapter 4
Cells and molecules of the
dreaming brain

By 1890, the scientiﬁc world was aware that the brain consisted of
billions of individual cells called neurons (100 billion at the last
count). In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, while sleep and
dream science were being prepared at the more global level of the
electroencephalograph (EEG), neurobiologists were learning more
about neurons than had even been imagined in anyone’s speculative
philosophy – and that anyone includes Sigmund Freud, Charles
Sherrington, and Ivan Pavlov.
Among other things, by 1950 it had become clear that, as each
neuron was bounded by a semipermeable membrane, it had the
capacity to concentrate an electrical charge across that membrane
by actively pumping ions such as sodium, potassium, and chloride
in and out of the cells. This membrane potential, as it was called,
could be raised (inhibition) or lowered (excitation) as a result of the
inﬂuence of chemical molecules secreted by neighbouring neurons,
which delivered their inﬂuences via specialized junctions called
synapses. The chemicals secreted from nerve endings were called
neurotransmitters because they permitted cell-to-cell signalling in
the brain.
When a neuron was sufﬁciently excited, its membrane potential
could suddenly reverse its sign and the resultant differential in
voltage, or action potential, could spread from the cell body over
48

the entire surface of the neuron, including its endings,
which were thereby induced to secrete their own brand of
chemical neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitters that are
directly responsible for neuronal excitability include
glutamate (excitatory) and gamma-aminobutyric acid or
GABA (inhibitory).

The reﬂex doctrine could not, however, help the pioneer sleep
and dream scientists very much, because no link could be
established between the activity of circuits of neurons
(neuronal circuits) and the EEG. It had long been assumed
that the EEG was the register of voltage changes in the brain
(i.e. cerebral action potentials), although this could not
explain the patterns of the EEG seen in sleep (e.g. spindles
and slow waves), unless neuronal activity was continuous,
i.e. spontaneous, as well as reﬂexive. Consequently, work at the
cellular and EEG levels proceeded along entirely separate but
parallel tracks, similar to those that Descartes thought God had
used to set mind and body in perfect but independent motion.
Cartesian duality dies slowly; it is still alive and well in most of us
because we cannot yet see how a physical object, the brain, can have
subjective experience. This is the so-called ‘hard problem’ of
philosophy.

49

Cells and molecules of the dreaming brain

Most of the very successful work in cellular neurobiology
was conducted under the protective umbrella of Sherrington’s
reﬂex doctrine, which provided sufﬁcient information to help
work out how neuronal circuits were organized. The reﬂex
circuit model could explain the following: the spinal reﬂexes
involved in posture and movement; the encoding of stimuli
in sequences of action potentials in neurons, which could
lead to sensation; and even the coordination of the sensory
and motor systems needed to account for movement (motor)
behaviour.

The basis of brain activation

Dreaming

Just before the middle of the last century, two classic sensorimotor
physiologists, Giuseppe Moruzzi and Horace Magoun, working at
Northwestern Medical School in Chicago, discovered that the
experimental stimulation of the brain stem of cats could cause a
shift in the EEG pattern from that of sleep to that of waking. In
other words, they established an experimental basis for brain
activation in sleep. Their results, published in 1949, antedated the
discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep by four years, and set
the stage for investigating brain activation in sleep by challenging
the deeply entrenched concept that all brain activation had to come
from the outside world via sensory stimulation.
Indeed, Moruzzi and Magoun’s hypothesis of a non-speciﬁc system
that was activated by a reticular (net-like) component of the brain
and that could operate independently of sensory input encountered
stiff resistance. This resistance was only gradually overcome by
their subsequent studies demonstrating independence of the
activation from the sensory pathways. Prolonged sleep-like
unresponsiveness occurred when this reticular system was
damaged leaving the sensory pathways intact. These follow-up
studies were being conducted just as the discovery of REM sleep
was being made (again in Chicago).

How does the study of REM sleep in cats help?
In 1957, William Dement, a co-worker of Aserinsky and Kleitman,
vigorously investigated the REM sleep–dream connection in
humans, and discovered that cats also had periods of brain
activation and REM in their sleep. This provided the experimental
model necessary for investigation of the cellular and molecular
basis of brain activation in sleep, and the chance to integrate
phenomena at the level of cells and molecules with the EEG and
the distinctive forms of mental activity in human sleep. We didn’t
need to know whether cats dreamed to make this integration. All we
50

Do animals dream?
All mammals have the same kind of brain activation during
sleep as humans. Whether or not they dream is another
question, which can be answered only by posing another one:
Do animals have consciousness? The answer to that question
has been hotly debated. Many scientists today feel that
animals probably do have a limited form of consciousness,
quite different from ours in that it lacks language and the
capacity for propositional or symbolic thought.

have them. But which pet owner would doubt that his or
her favourite animal friend has perception, memory, and
emotion? These are three of the key aspects of consciousness,
and they could be experienced whether or not an animal
had verbal language as we do. When the animal’s brain
is activated during sleep, why not assume that the animal
has some sort of perceptual, emotional, and memory
experience?
In terms of the important scientiﬁc use to which we could
put animal sleep in the study of human dreaming, it makes
little difference what the answer to the question about
animal dreams might be. All we need know, in order to
learn from our animal colleagues, is that they have the
same kind of brain activation in their sleep as we do. We
then go on to make the fairly safe assumption that animals
have the same mechanisms of brain activation in sleep as
we do.

The hypothesis of REM sleep correspondence across species was
greatly strengthened by the subsequent ﬁnding that all but the most
primitive mammals had periodic brain activation during sleep. If
they had eyes, they also had REMs in their activated sleep phases.
Besides shoring up the homology hypothesis, this surprising fact
suggested that REM was biologically important to all mammalian
life, whatever its relationship to human dreaming. Conversely, it
suggested that the correlation of REM and dreaming was a very
limiting way of thinking about the functional signiﬁcance of brain
activation in sleep.
As it turned out, both of these new ways of looking at sleep were
useful and important. For example, it has become clear that REM
sleep subserves body temperature regulation (thermoregulation),
perhaps the most basic of all mammalian housekeeping functions.
Many experiments indicate that REM also facilitates the
consolidation and advancement of procedural learning. As
procedural learning is the acquired ability to do things when
consciousness may not be involved, the subjective experience of
dreams could never suggest even this high-level functional
principle. And how could we know, from our dreaming, that our
capacity to regulate our own temperature was being assured by
REM sleep?
Using the techniques of electrical stimulation and surgical
alterations of the brain that led to Moruzzi and Magoun’s concept
of activation of a reticular system in the brain, the French
neurophysiologist Michel Jouvet, working in Lyons from the
mid-1950s onward, established once and for all that brain
activation did occur and that it occurred spontaneously in sleep.
He also proved that REM sleep was organized by the brain stem,
including this reticular formation. By discovering the active
suppression of muscle tone that invariably accompanies REM sleep,
52

Jouvet also helped us understand how the brain could be turned on
without producing waking behaviour. As the motor system was
actively blocked at the level of the spinal cord, real movement was
impossible even if the upper brain elaborated and commanded the
rich behaviours that we perceive in our dream scenarios.
12/3/1980 Parachute, Dream no. 29
A group of parachutists descends from behind forward – the sky is
blue, the chutes white – suddenly and unexpectedly, one chutist
passes the others rapidly – it is now clear that this is a contest – and
the new man, from Navy, will win easily. But is his chute open?
Yes. To guide his descent he climbs the cords – like a fetus

In this dream, I myself am not moving as I was in earlier examples,
but the perceived movement of three parachutists is nevertheless
dynamic and emotionally gripping. The impending doom of such
dream movement is typical and suggests not only the co-activation
of anxiety in the limbic brain, but also the generation of unfamiliar

or intrinsically impossible movement patterns at the level of the
brain stem itself, where the neurons controlling body position in
space are located.

Dreaming

Jouvet’s most radical and deﬁnitive experiments supported this
idea. When he isolated the brain stem below the level of the
junction of the two areas of the brain known as the pons and the
midbrain and, even when he removed all of the brain above this
level, he could still observe the periodic suppression of muscle tone,
and occasional eye and body movements, including the rhythmic
stepping that would be used in real locomotion by a normal cat
during waking. In other words, one of the key formal features of
human dreaming, the sense of continuous motion, may arise at the
very low level of parts of the brain stem that generate motor
patterns. In any case, such generators are present in the brain stem
and are activated in REM.
Like Aserinsky and Kleitman, Michel Jouvet knew how to exploit
the chance discoveries very well. He was trying to study something
else (Pavlovian conditioning) when his cats, like Aserinsky’s
children, fell asleep. As he was also trying to monitor the cat’s
attention in waking, his neck muscle electrodes picked up the
atonia (lack of tone) of REM sleep. In science, as elsewhere in life, it
is an ill wind that blows no one some good! And later, luck found
Jouvet ready again. As he was a neurosurgeon, studied cats, and
wanted to integrate the EEG of structures such as the brain stem
and the thalamus located under the cortex (subcortical structures),
Jouvet was able to observe the paroxysmal (PGO) waves that arise
in different areas of the brain – the pons of the brain stem reticular
formation (P), the geniculate body of the thalamus (G), and the
occipital cortex (O) – during REM sleep. These waves, which were
markedly reduced in waking, indicated that the brain activation of
REM sleep was physiologically as well as psychologically distinctive.
Figure 3 shows recordings of PGO waves from the cortex, thalamus,
and brain stem.

54

3. The visual brain stimulates itself in REM sleep via a mechanism
reﬂected in EEG recordings as PGO waves. Originating in the pons
(P) from the neurons that move the eyes, these signals are conducted
both to the lateral geniculate (G) body in the thalamus and to the
occipital cortex (O). (The three traces shown were not recorded
simultaneously.)

Although counterintuitive, the discovery of brain activation in
sleep was rapidly accepted by those dream scientists who had
sudden and transformative ah-ha experiences when they read
about it. In the ensuing excitement about the similarities between
waking and dreaming consciousness, few stopped to wonder what
bit of this sleep-dependent brain activation could account for the
difference, which, after all, is every bit as important as the
similarities:

Why is dreaming so strongly sensorimotor, a feature unmatched in
even the most vivid waking fantasies?
Why is dreaming so rarely self-reﬂective, when waking
consciousness is so often dominated by internal thought?
Why is dreaming so limited by impoverishment in recall? In
particular, why do we lose the capacity to recount actively declarative
memories (memories that are learned quickly and consciously) and
gain the capacity to activate remote ones?
Why is almost all dreaming forgotten?
Why are dreams so bizarre?
55

Cells and molecules of the dreaming brain

What chemical control is there of the brain–mind
states?

Could physiology help us answer these questions as well? Certainly
not if all we paid attention to was brain activation and the common
aspects of its occurrence in waking and sleep.

Dreaming

To answer all these questions about the distinctive features of
dream consciousness, it was necessary to know not only that the
brain was switched back on in sleep, but also that this switch
process was effected by quite different mechanisms from those of
waking. After all, we usually don’t wake up during REM and we
already knew, from Jouvet’s early work, part of the reason why we
don’t move: our muscles are actively inhibited. This guarantees the
continuation of immobility and it helps us understand why we often
awaken feeling paralysed in our dreams.
Moreover, we knew from the PGO wave discovery that REM sleep
activation had distinct pulses. Each PGO wave, and there are
something like 14,000 PGO waves per day in the cat, delivered a
pulse of activation to the brain, similar to what would happen if we
were startled by an unexpected stimulus during waking. This fact
meant that dreaming was a mental state made up of both sustained
electrical brain activation and very strong, very discrete arousal
stimuli. The PGO waves could thus mediate distinctive aspects
of dream mental activity such as the intense absorption (the
dominance of percepts over thoughts) the bizarreness (based on
discontinuity and incongruity of times, places, and people), and the
constant sensorimotor content (as if the brain were compelled by
the self-activation process to elaborate one movement scenario after
another).

Neuromodulation and brain state
None of this explains why memory is pre-empted. Nor does it
explain how PGO waves arise in REM sleep. To unlock those
puzzles, we needed the key provided by the discovery of control
by neurons, i.e. neuromodulation, a special kind of chemical
neurotransmission by which the brain is able to change its state
56

globally. Brain state is set by the mode of information processing:
when the brain switches mode from external to internal
information sources; when it switches from a store-and-remember
to a don’t-store-and-forget mode; and when it switches from
linear–logical to a parallel associative mode. All of these mode
switches can go on in small but signiﬁcant ways in waking, but they
become obligatory, pronounced, and ﬁxed when the brain enters
REM sleep.

To understand this almost alarmingly simple hypothesis, it
is important to recognize what is so special about these
neuromodulatory neurons and their chemical messengers:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

They are relatively few and relatively small.
They are highly localized to a few brain stem nuclei.
They are pacemaker cells in that they are rhythmical and
spontaneous unless they are inhibited.
They ﬁre at relatively low rates, in metronome-like fashion.
They project their ﬁne, multiply branching processes all over the
brain and spinal cord.
57

Cells and molecules of the dreaming brain

We now suppose that the reason for the change in brain state is the
dramatic change in neuromodulation that distinguishes REM sleep
from waking. In 1960, the presence of brain stem cells containing
the neuromodulators noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and
serotonin were reported by the Swedish neuroanatomist Kjell Fuxe.
It has since become clear that these cells change their output when
animals go to sleep and most dramatically when they enter REM
sleep. To summarise this story, the serotonin and noradrenaline
cells that modulate the brain during waking reduce their output by
half during non-REM sleep but are shut off completely during REM
sleep. This means that the electrically reactivated brain is working
without the participation of two of its chemical systems that
mediate the awake state. These very systems have been strongly
implicated in precisely those awake state functions (such as
attention, memory, and reﬂective thought) that are lost in dreaming.

Vernon Mountcastle has called this unique collection of cells a
‘brain-within-the-brain’. By this, he means that they constitute
a mode-switching mechanism that can automatically and
forcibly change the microclimate of the rest of the brain. An
analogy to the temperature and climate control system situated
in the cellar of a modern home, but inﬂuencing all its rooms, comes
to mind.

Dreaming

Figure 4 shows how the neuromodulatory cells of the brain stem
(area called the pons) project up to the thalamus and cortex
and down to the spinal cord to mediate the EEG changes of
REM sleep.
Now the emphasis on the power of the formal approach to the study
of dreaming should become clear even to those who still long for
the mystique of fortune-cookie dream interpretation. We can see
that, when the brain self-activates in sleep, it changes its chemical
self-instructions. The mind has no choice but to go along with the
programme. It sees, it moves, and it feels things intensely but it does
not think, remember, or focus attention very well. This, in turn,
shows clearly that our so-called minds are functional states of our
brains. The mind is not something else – it is not a spirit, it is not an
independent entity. It is the self-activated brain whose capacity for
subjectivity remains to be explained but whose form of subjectivity
can now be understood.
This is the most radical assertion of modern dream science. Waking
and dreaming are two states of consciousness, with differences that
depend on chemistry. Can you digest the proposition? Or does it
stick in your craw? Do you say, yes, but . . . and ﬁll in the dots with a
host of questions that are designed to express your curiosity about
as-yet unexplained details, and defend yourself against the
humiliation of having your dreaming reduced to a brain state? You
know that you are more than a brain state, don’t you? But how do
you know that? By your subjectivity, you reply (which I haven’t yet
explained, have I?). So you still have a loophole, but please
58

admit that the net is closing. And, please, bear with me as I
attempt to show you how lucky you are to be such a fabulous,
automatic, and reliable set of brain mechanisms that you can
dream, imagine, create, and feel in your sleep. In due course, I will
also try to assure you that, as being a brain does entail a subjective
aspect, you are the free agent you always supposed yourself to be.
You don’t have much free choice but the little you do have can go a
long, long way.

The biochemistry and pharmacology of
REM sleep

Dreaming

This is a good time to review the correlation of dreaming with
sleep and to drive home my point that this correlation is
continuous, partial, and statistical rather than discontinuous,
complete, and categorical. As the state of the brain changes
continuously, it only gradually changes its mode. It does not
suddenly switch from one state to another. Furthermore, the
continuous and gradual modulatory changes do not affect every
single neuron of the brain identically or even simultaneously.
These generalizations, which all ﬂow from neurobiological work on
the state control systems of the brain stem, have far-reaching
implications for a general theory of mind as well as for a speciﬁc
theory of dreaming.
Mental states, such as waking and dreaming, are as many
splendoured in their details as are the waking and sleeping brain.
For example, perceptions may arise internally as well as externally
during waking: fantasies of near hallucinatory intensity can
intrude on waking and train whistles or telephone rings can
invade dream plots. In the spirit of statistics, however, the
probabilities of these two phenomena are reversed in waking and
dreaming, and these probabilities are set by the neuromodulatory
systems, Mountcastle’s brain within the brain. In waking, external
stimuli are far more likely to be accurately perceived than in
dreaming. In dreaming, internal stimuli are far more likely to
give rise to hallucinatory imagery than in waking. We need to
understand the mechanisms of this contrast much better because
nothing less than our sanity is at stake. Later, when we examine
the impact of the neuromodulation theory on mental illness, we
will see that all the drugs that are now used to treat psychoses
have a role to play on the neuromodulators. We also see that they
do so in ways that are often consonant with the role of these
chemicals in shifting the balance of the brain to be awake or
dreaming.
60

Chemical microstimulation

As it turned out, acetylcholine was a prime mover not
only of muscles, but also of the central brain state. Acetylcholinecontaining neurons ﬁre in both waking and REM sleep, so they may
help to mediate EEG activation in both states. Their excitability is
apparently enhanced in REM sleep because of the decrease in
inhibition from the serotonin-containing neurons, which you will
remember are turned off in REM. In their variety and complexity,
these neurophysiological details can become confusing. The main
point to keep in mind is that in REM sleep the brain, although
electrically as activated as in waking, is activated in a chemically
very different way.
This conclusion was dramatically supported by chemical
microstimulation experiments, which showed, unequivocally, that
REM sleep could be induced by injecting very small amounts of a
cholinergic drug into the area of the brain stem known as the pons.
Moreover, the pattern and timing of the REM sleep-enhancing
effect depended on what part of the pontine brain stem was
chemically altered. If the drug was placed in a particular area of the
brain (the reticular formation on either side of the midline), cats fell
asleep faster, entered REM sleep sooner, and stayed in it longer
61

Cells and molecules of the dreaming brain

Once the behaviour of the serotonin- and noradrenaline-containing
neurons of the brain stem had been recorded with microelectrodes
and charted across the sleep cycle, it was natural to wonder what
would happen if we conducted more active experiments by
intentionally interfering with their natural propensities. The
experimental technique called chemical microstimulation was
devised, and it proved to be highly successful in studying yet
another neuromodulatory system of the brain stem, the cholinergic
system, so named because its effects on target neurons are mediated
by acetylcholine, a molecule long known to effect movement by
changing the charge of (i.e. depolarizing) muscle ﬁbres and causing
them to contract and move our limbs.

than when inert chemicals were used. Much, much longer! Cats
normally have spontaneous REM sleep periods that run from 4 to
10 minutes in length, and they might show 60- to 70-minute REMs
when stimulated by a cholinergic drug. These chemically enhanced
REM sleep periods were not only longer, but stronger, with more
REMs when the drug was present.

Dreaming

Were we producing chemical dreams? This question is moot in cats,
although even in humans, where similar effects are obtained, we
would say only that we can enhance dreaming by enhancing REM
sleep. As scientists, we think that all dreams are chemically
mediated. So, yes, we are producing dreams chemically by helping
the brain to do so.
These results have been widely replicated and accepted, which
means that the brain side of dream science is now ﬁrmly
established. Scientiﬁc acceptance of cholinergic REM enhancement
came slowly. We had to show that a variety of cholinergic drugs
could work, that they could all be blocked with anticholinergic
(atropine) treatment, and that even drugs such as neostigmine,
which work by blocking the normal enzymatic breakdown of
acetylcholine, can enhance REMs. We can safely conclude that
REM sleep dreaming is mediated by acetylcholine when
noradrenaline and serotonin are at very low levels.
What all this means about the function of REMs is another
question. What is the effect on learning and memory of making the
brain so strongly cholinergic in REM sleep? Acetylcholine has long
been implicated in learning and memory, so the REM story
contributes in a signiﬁcant way to an emerging picture that is
consistent with our partial, statistical model of the brain as mind.
Here is a sample hypothesis: we can trigger memory fragments with
acetylcholine but cannot make new ones without noradrenaline and
serotonin.
I said that it made a difference where the cholinergic drug was
62

placed. When the microinjection is made in an area of the brain
that is at the furthest edge of the pons (the far lateral pons), at
points near to where the acetylcholine-containing neurons are
found, the effects are quite different and informative; we see
delayed rather than immediate REM enhancement. This is
particularly surprising because the drug does immediately enhance
PGO waves that we had previously thought might be the cause of
REMs. Their dissociation in long-term enhancements of REMs
proves, however, that they cannot be the cause. Besides, by
temporarily uncoupling the PGO waves from REM, the delayed
enhancement is prolonged, lasting 6–10 days instead of 4–6 hours
after more medial injections into the reticular formation.

Under normal circumstances, the timing and amount of REMs
(and hence dreaming) are controlled by the excitability level of
(among others) the cholinergic neurons. And that level is subject to
a wide variety of genetic and experimental factors that contribute to
long- and short-term differences in sleep, which are correlated with
normal development, learning, and memory, and even mood and
temperament. The brain–mind functions well if, and only if, the
cholinergic system is operating within certain limits. These limits
are set by biological and behavioural mechanisms that the chemical
microstimulation theory of REM sleep can help us to understand.
63

Cells and molecules of the dreaming brain

We ourselves are only slowly digesting these ﬁndings, which seem to
point us in the direction of molecular biology rather than dream
theory. This may indicate, as do other signs in the ﬁeld, that the gap
between REM sleep and DNA, both discovered half a century ago,
may be closing. Our reasoning is as follows: the reticular site, where
cholinergic stimulation produces immediate and short-lived REM
enhancement, is a trigger zone; by contrast, the lateral pontine site
mentioned earlier, where low immediate PGO waves and long-term
REM enhancement are produced, is a control region. The difference
between the two sites is that one – the control region – actually
contains cholinergic neurons whereas the other, the trigger zone,
does not.

Chapter 5
Why dream? The functions of
brain activation in sleep

We have already given our answer to the question of why
we dream based on physiological mechanisms: because the
brain self-activates in sleep. We have already hinted that dreaming
itself may be an epiphenomenon of brain self-activation, so
dreaming may occur for reasons that are quite different from those
that we would infer from the psychological study of REM sleep
dreaming.
In the last chapter we noticed, moreover, that rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep always involves intense brain self-activation, occurs in
all mammalian species, and is carefully controlled by a genetically
regulated chemical system. This means that, without a doubt, REM
sleep is important to mammalian biology. It is highly conserved
across species, quantitatively regulated within species, and varies
with the stages of brain development. In this chapter, we examine
the last two points by considering the changes that occur during
development, and the effects of upsetting the system by making
REM sleep impossible or, at least, very difﬁcult.

Do babies dream?
The human newborn baby offers one of the best opportunities to
observe REM behaviour directly. This is not only because REM
occurs at sleep onset (as Eugene Aserinsky noticed in the young
64

The human fetus begins to show highly organized and spontaneous
movement very early in its uterine life. By 30 weeks of gestation,
these movement patterns within the organism include the
eyes (REMs), the face (early or primordial emotion?), and
the limbs (primordial locomotion?). All of these ﬁndings have
profound implications for our concept of the brain–mind and
how it develops. Clearly, nature has provided its most elaborate
creation – the human brain–mind – with its own means
of self-activation. In his recent book, I of the Vortex, the
neurophysiologist Rodolfo Llinas has suggested that endogenous
motility contributes to the fundamental sense of agency that is
the essence of self-hood!
So we sleep, perchance to dream. And we dream, perforce to
reactivate the brain basis of self-hood that is embedded in our
built-in capacity to generate movement. Put another way, our
dreams – so constantly and elaborately animated – remind us that
we were born with an already huge talent for movement and for the
sensorimotor perceptions of movement that become the centre of
our sense of self as agents. Speculating further, we might imagine
that every night, after 90 minutes and for at least two hours, we are
‘born again’, where that phrase, borrowed from fundamentalist
65

participants in his studies), but also because the movements
associated with the pulse-like aspects of brain activation are more
intense and less completely inhibited than they are in adults.
Consequently, not just humans, but newborns of all species show
dramatic muscle twitches of the limbs and trunk, together with
highly expressive contractions of the facial muscles: as if dream
emotions were being read out directly. Babies show pleasure,
fear, surprise, and disgust in the facial expressions of REM sleep.
Do they feel these emotions? Are these emotions the building
blocks of dreams? In short, do babies dream? Our scientiﬁc
answer to these rhetorical questions must be ‘We don’t
(and can’t) know’. But our personal inclination might well
be ‘why not?’.

When does dreaming start?
One of the most striking ﬁndings of modern sleep research
is that the immature individual, whether a human baby, a
kitten, or a puppy, has a lot more brain activation in sleep
than it will when it grows up. What this means is that a brain
substrate for dreaming is present at birth. Whether babies
have dreams is moot, just as it is with animals. The baby is
developing consciousness, and has primordial perception,
emotion, and memory, but he or she does not yet have
language. Propositional or symbolic thought depends on
language. If babies do dream, their subjective experience

Dreaming

cannot possibly be of the same quality as that of adults.
Psychologists who have studied the development of dreaming in children ﬁnd that the accounts of dreaming that are
similar to those of adults start to appear at about age three,
when the infant is acquiring language and propositional
thought. Children’s dreams then become more and more
complex and interesting up until about age seven, when most
of the formal adult dream characteristics are reported.
Taken together with animal evidence, this suggests that
brain activation is not enough to produce dreaming. The
upper brain circuits that support language and propositional
thought must be functional in order for dreaming to occur.
The fact that human and other mammalian newborns have
so much more brain activation in sleep than adults, together
with the fact that the dreaming of children is relatively
impoverished, also suggests that REM sleep is important for
development in some ways that dreaming does not predict.

66

religion, has an entirely somatic (bodily) and secular meaning. If
I do not yet make myself entirely clear, let me add that the formalist
approach to dreaming reveals that ﬁctitious movement – the sense
of moving in dream space – is a powerful point in favour of Llinas’
theory. Another point is that the only dimension of orientation
that is secure in dreaming is the sense of self – I am always at the
centre of the vortex that is my dream.

18/6/1984 Quest, Dream no. 33
The overall theme was a quest – I was looking for something, or
perhaps just a way (in both the geographical and strategic senses
of the word).
One scene was in a restaurant/hotel with the usual confusion of
rooms, levels, and people. It seemed like a reunion in the dining
room because there were some people from Harvard there though
none was identiﬁed. My job was to ﬁnd the back door so as to exit
directly to the street and not backtrack to the lobby. I opened several
doors only to ﬁnd that they were in fact windows which had been
closed, by carpentered panels, from the outside. I noticed that
wooden wedges had been inserted between the window frames and
the panels, an elaborate contrivance for which the function was not
apparent. It seemed odd that the panels would be so spaced rather
than ﬁtting ﬂush.

I gave up on the shortcut exit plan and started back to the lobby.
Then the scene shifted to a classical temple, Greek or Egyptian.
There was a narrow stair passing below a stone arch with a

prominent keystone. I remarked how one of the pleasures of
working at Harvard was exposure to beauty. This seemed to explain
the strange scene shift adequately.
But, abruptly, I was walking on a Vermont hillside, covered with
snow, looking for an old woman. The snow was slightly off-white
making me wonder if there were fresh manure just under the
surface. Despite the risk, I decided to eat some snow to quench my
thirst. It was tasteless.
I was then talking with someone like Marshall Newland about the
old woman whom I had not yet reached. He offered an aphorism
that seemed, in typical Vermont fashion, to sum up the situation:
‘I may be hard to ﬁnd, but when you get there, you can count on
my presence.’

Dreaming

This seemed to mean that reliability was the reward of persistence.

The ‘I’ of this dream is amazingly secure given the whirling
inconstancies of place and action. This report also illustrates the
strange impoverishment of thinking that typiﬁes dreams that are as
animated as this one. This suggests that it is sensorimotor action,
not cognition, that is important to the developmental processes that
we are discussing. In other words, my sense of agency is ﬁrst linked
to movement; only later is it elaborated in thought.

Do fetuses dream?
In the womb (or uterus), at 30 weeks’ gestation, the human fetus
is spending almost 24 hours of each day in a brain-activated state
that constitutes a ﬁrst level of REM sleep. At birth, an unequivocal
REM sleep state occupies at least half of not less than 16 hours of
sleep each day. This guarantees at least eight hours of automatic,
off-line brain activation each and every day. Ask yourself why? And
let your answer run its full course: to develop the human brain. To
make up the mind – in a word to become an increasingly effective
mover and an increasingly distinctive self.
So, it probably doesn’t really matter whether babies dream except in
68

so far as subjectivity must develop part and parcel with movement
competence, if the hypothesis of movement–agency–self is to have
any credibility at all. By now, we can certainly reject as gratuitous
any assumption that infantile dream content is meaningful or fulﬁls
wishes in a psychoanalytic sense. Far from indicating psychological
defensiveness, the early occurrence of motion and emotion in REM
sleep argue for the opposite: a redundant, reliable, and remarkable
offence designed to self-organize behaviour and tie it to subjectivity.
Figure 5 illustrates the dramatic changes that occur in sleep and
waking during the human life cycle.
Why do babies have so much REM sleep? What shuts the system
down as development proceeds? These important questions have
not yet been answered deﬁnitively because the study of sleep
development is still (please pardon the expression) in its infancy.
But, it is very likely that the following biological facts hold true:
1.

The brain stem: as the seat of the most primordial (ﬁrst-line)
regulatory systems (temperature, cardiovascular, and respiratory to
name three), the brain stem must develop earlier than the upper

5. The relative proportions of each 24-hour day that are devoted to
wake, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep change dramatically over our
lifetime. Exactly how and when these states develop in early uterine
existence is not known (dotted lines), but data from premature infants
suggests that REM sleep is almost all of life at 26 weeks of gestation age.
After 26 weeks, waking increases progressively and inexorably until
death.

brain, in particular earlier than the part of the brain housing the
thalamus and cortex (thalamocortical brain) which will later
support the emergence of consciousness.
The cholinergic system of the brain stem: as the mediator of
internal bodily (endogenous) activation, this system must develop
earlier than the serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems (i.e.
systems involving the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline),
which will be needed as the individual shifts priority from sleeping
to waking.
Later development of the other systems of chemicals known as
aminergic systems (chemicals include histamine and dopamine) is
what shuts down infant sleep and especially REM sleep, reducing it
by at least 400 per cent from infancy to early adult life.

Dreaming

How much sleep do we need?
What happens if we do not get the sleep we need and how much do
we need it? You can answer these questions for yourself just as well
as I can. But, before you try, you should realize two things: the ﬁrst
is that sleep has now been accorded the variability inherent in all
biological phenomena, i.e. short sleepers (four to six hours a day)
are no more ‘abnormal’ or unusual than longer sleepers (eight to ten
hours a day). Even if most adults sleep six to eight hours, it doesn’t
mean that they always do so. Sleep, like body weight, ﬂuctuates
according to the complex interaction of internal set-points, social
customs, climate, and personal experience. The second is that, even
when we sleep very little, we are able to compensate extremely well,
especially if the stakes are high. If we are motivated – either by
reward or the need to avoid disaster – we can normally manage to
squeeze a little more cognitive competence out of our weary brains.
Now give your answer. My answer is that I now need eight to ten
hours (and still don’t feel completely refreshed). When I was
younger I survived on four to six hours. As a medical house ofﬁcer
and sleep researcher, I sometimes went for 36 consecutive hours
without any sleep whatsoever. But, whatever my baseline, I have
70

always noticed that sleep curtailment compromises my ability to
be attentive and to organize my own mental activity efﬁciently and
effectively. To read, to write, to listen, and to talk well, I need a good
night’s sleep. And, recognizing that fact, I try my best to get it.
When I was sleep deprived, and/or stressed, I was far more likely
to have intense, bizarre dreams such as the one I reported earlier in
this chapter (Dream no. 33, page 67).
Why have lab studies of sleep deprivation had so much difﬁculty
achieving consensus about the costs of sleep losses and the inferred
beneﬁts of sleep gains? To understand this issue, it is helpful to go

Why dream? The functions of brain activation in sleep

6. Like all biological functions, sleep length varies widely. If the
number of people who sleep for various durations is plotted on a graph,
the result is a bell-shaped curve. Estimations of the chance of falling
within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean are shown below.
Only one in a thousand people falls outside these limits, but such short
or long sleepers do exist.

back to the early days of the 1960s, when the discovery of REM
sleep unleashed a storm of experimental enquiry.

Dreaming

The good news is that the storm was unleashed. The bad news is
that the studies were often driven by the scientiﬁcally naı̈ve and
ﬂawed ideas of psychoanalysis. The history of so-called ‘dream
deprivation’ is a good case in point. As REM sleep was correlated
with dreaming, it tended to be equated with it. Deprive the
participants in a study of REM sleep and you will deprive them
of dreams. True enough, but only partially true.
As dreaming normally occurs at sleep onset and in non-REM
(NREM) sleep (and no one has yet investigated the possibility that
this tendency increases when REM sleep is curtailed), William
Dement and his psychoanalyst–neuroscientist colleague Charles
Fisher were sure that dream deprivation (REM deprivation, really)
would cause people to become psychotic because they would
not have the psychic escape valve that dreaming – and only
dreaming – made available to them. Needless to say, some of the
participants did become psychotic when their sleep deprivation was
prolonged. Everyone who lived through this period remembers the
stories of students who became psychotic after 10 days of REM
deprivation. As a publicity stunt, the disc jockey Peter Tripp was
kept awake for 72 hours in his broadcasting booth. Tripp’s normal
hypnomanic radio chatter was gradually replaced by ﬁxed paranoid
delusions.
In retrospect, none of these studies was morally justiﬁed because
the working hypothesis was that dream deprivation would, if
pushed far enough, drive the individuals crazy. Although I am
disappointed with the lack of clarity that still clouds this area of
science, I would not myself either submit to such treatment or
expose others to it.
Sceptics such as Anthony Kales did much more careful work on
this problem, and invariably showed that normal humans are
72

surprisingly immune to sleep deprivation. When they assessed sleep
deprivation’s effects using quantitative psychological tests, they
found no differences between selective REM sleep reduction and
total sleep reduction, and only very small impairments with either.
What these studies seemed to show was that there was nothing
particularly special about REM sleep – or dreaming – for the
maintenance of psychic equilibrium. Indirectly, these results also
weakened the naı̈ve ‘hydraulic’ hypothesis that it was pressure to
dream that, when released, caused psychosis.

For every Edison, there is another person who will never invent
anything, will never feel well rested, and should never attempt
medical school. Such ‘long’ sleepers should take satisfaction in their
sensitivity, their capacity to feel, to be, and to reﬂect. Poetry and
literature are compatible with the stay-in-bed lifestyles of the
Marcel Prousts, Samuel Taylor Coleridges, and Graham Greenes of
the world. All three celebrated sleep and dreaming quite actively
and began to set up a culture of internal reﬂection, skill in creating
one’s own values, and narrative production that is every bit as
needed by the world as light bulbs. What, after all, are we to read
when we are awake at night?
In the rest of this chapter, we see that sleep is much more than a
Band-Aid for the brain–mind’s cognitive competence. We see that
73

Why dream? The functions of brain activation in sleep

These studies did not, however, mean – as many incorrectly
supposed – that sleep was without salutary effects on the mind. The
idea that sleep is a waste of time is still deeply embedded in our
culture, along with our commitment to achievement, doing, and
material success. If you were asked to name the most accomplished
American entrepreneur, you might well nominate Thomas Edison,
our candidate (as inventor of the light bulb) who prided himself on
his ability to be very productive on very little sleep. Thomas Edison
might have been a true short sleeper, genetically endowed with a
high-energy brain that allowed him to be more active, more
wakeful, and more creative than most of us.

sleep is essential to life in ways that psychology could never
imagine. In Chapter 6, we learn that cognitive competence does
suffer – mightily – from sleep loss, although this effect can be
demonstrated experimentally only when tasks that demand
prolonged attention and complex sequences of thought processes
are used to challenge sleep-deprived individuals. Later, when
discussing depression in Chapter 7, we return to sleep–mental
illness connections, and realize that the same brain-stem systems
that control and trigger dreaming mediate mood and mode of
thinking.

Dreaming

Is sleep essential to life?
If we do not survive, we do not reproduce. What do we, as
mammals, need to do in order to survive? We need to eat, and to
convert dietary calories into fuel for bodily functions; we also need
to avoid predation, especially when we are vulnerable – at night, for
example. So far, so good. We need to eat without being eaten.
But we must also stay warm (or cool) enough to function effectively.
This involves maintaining our core body temperature within the
very narrow range of daily ﬂuctuation (no more than 0.83 degrees
Celsius, or 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit). If we become overheated, our
brains do not work well – in fact they go to sleep, which is why
tropical cultures are more likely to create siestas than Thomas
Edisons. If we become cold, our brains are equally upset. The
mountaineer’s mnemonic for cold exposure says, ﬁrst you fumble,
then you mumble, and then you stumble, and ﬁnally, you tumble.
For us, technological kings of the beasts, ‘predation’ may seem like
an idle threat. But think of life in the inner city and tell me how
much you enjoy walking at night in ill-lit neighbourhoods. Think of
the threat of infection against which we must constantly ﬁght to
avoid pneumonia (colds and sore throats are bad enough), to avoid
invasion of our bloodstreams by the micro-organisms that inhabit
our intestines (and normally aid digestion without asking for more
74

than a part of our meals), and to maintain immunity to avoid
invasion by a vast army of destructive viruses (such as inﬂuenza A,
hepatitis B, and so on through the alphabet). These are our
predators as much as lions are for zebras!

It is important to emphasize the fact that these experimental
conditions were so extreme that it is difﬁcult to imagine them
occurring naturally. It is also important to note that it takes two
weeks, a surprisingly long time, for the most severely debilitating
effects to set in. Finally, we can take some comfort from the fact
that, at any stage in the proceedings, recovery is complete when
sleep is allowed. We should not assume, however, that the results of
experimental sleep deprivation of a type that we will probably never
experience are irrelevant to our own concepts of sleep hygiene.
Anyone who has ever noticed that even minor sleep loss leads to
increased risk of infection will get this point easily.
The ﬁrst defect, in what inevitably became a fatal syndrome in
sleep-deprived rats, was the tendency for the skin to break down, to
lose its continuity and integrity. By the end of the second week, this
was associated with highly motivated heat-seeking behaviour – rats
always found the warmest corner of their cage. What then ensued
challenges credibility: the rats lost weight and the weight loss was
so unrelenting that it could not be countered by constant eating! In
other words, the caloric value of food declined, presumably as more
and more of the animal’s own energy resources were devoted to
keeping warm. The capacity to regulate the body temperature was
75

Why dream? The functions of brain activation in sleep

It turns out that all of these functions suffer when sleep deprivation
becomes extreme. The recent experiments of Allan Rechtschaffen
and his group, at the same University of Chicago where sleep and
dream science began in the early 1950s, made it impossible – or at
least very difﬁcult – for one of a pair of rats to sleep. The other rat
was free to sleep whenever the sleep-deprived rat was awake. In this
way, it was possible to reduce sleep greatly in the one without
signiﬁcant reduction in the other.

also lost. The very essence of mammalian adaptation – and the
reﬂex property on which brain function depends – is temperature
regulation. Without sleep, temperature regulation and normal
brain function cannot be maintained. The implication, which I ﬁnd
irresistible, is that all of us refresh our thermoregulatory capacities
every night as we sleep.

Dreaming

By the end of the third and fourth weeks, the sleep-deprived rats
began to die off. They were metabolically starved in the presence of
enough food to keep the control rat sleek, plump, and as happy as a
rat can be under such circumstances. Death occurred when the
sleep-deprived rats could no longer fend off infection. They were
invaded by bacteria from their own bowels – eaten up by normally
symbiotic hitchhikers that were no longer satisﬁed just to go along
for the ride.
Now, you might say that we have come a long way from dreaming
and even from brain activation in sleep, but I don’t think so and I
hope that a moment’s reﬂection will show you why. To explain why
sleep normally defends us from such fates, we must assume that it
is the change in brain state, with all its chemical and electrical
transformations, that keeps us healthy. A second reason,
admittedly theoretical, is that our drive to sleep is so intense, so
demanding, and so enduring that it must have important survival
functions.
What about the brain activation part? What about dreams? How
are dreaming and thermoregulation related to one another?
My answer is that only mammals have thermoregulation and
only mammals have REM sleep, so it is likely that these two
functions – and dreaming – are tied together in some way. What
could that ‘way’ be? Here we can only speculate, but before
doing so let us take note of another surprising fact. It is only in
REM sleep that mammals can not thermoregulate. We can put
all of this together in a theoretical way for future experiments to
investigate.
76

Food-ﬁnding and food ingestion all depend on waking behaviour
which, in turn, depends on brain activation. In the case of
waking brain activation, systems involving chemicals such as
norepinephrine and seratonin (aminergic systems) operate and
we know that thermoregulation depends on them. All waking
functions consume energy and are risky for, although essential to,
survival.

What is the function of dreaming?
It has recently been suggested by the philosopher Owen Flanagan
that dreaming is an epiphenomenon (a causal occurrence or
functionally insigniﬁcant phenomenon), i.e. it has no function
as such. Taking this position is rather extreme, but scientiﬁcally
tenable, because there is no evidence that the content of dreams
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on waking behaviour. It may help us to
notice, via our dreams, that we are complex emotional creatures,
but we know this already. Recall of dreaming cannot be all that
important because there are so many individuals with little or no
dream recall whatsoever who function quite nicely.
Even if the conscious experience of dreaming and its recall are
epiphenomena, the brain process that underlies dreams could
77

Why dream? The functions of brain activation in sleep

Brain activation in sleep is brought about in a very different way:
the aminergic systems are turned off, so thermoregulation is
impossible, although thermoregulation is not needed in REM sleep
because the animal is thermally safe in its nest – safe from heat loss
and predation. The brain activation of sleep is by nerve ﬁbres that
have the same effect as a chemical known as acetylcholine (and
their effect is called cholinergic); it is energy-conserving and safe,
but every bit as essential to survival because it allows the animal to
restore the effectiveness of its core regulatory systems. At the same
time, the brain–mind is off-line and free to reorganize its cognitive
repertoire as well as its more basic bodily functions. We say much
more about this later.

Dreaming

perform a number of functions. The most popular current theory is
that the activation of the brain in sleep is necessary for us to reorder
the information inside our heads, to get rid of certain obsolete
memories, to update memories, and to incorporate new experiences
into our memory systems. We discuss this theory in more detail in
Chapter 9. In addition to this cognitive function, the activation of
the brain during sleep could have a lifelong developmental role. As
we have just seen, REM sleep is far more prevalent in newborn
infants than it is in adults. This suggests that it is the construction
of the brain itself that is one of the functions of brain activation in
sleep. There is no reason for us to think that development stops
once we have acquired language; we go on throughout our lives
needing to reconstruct our brains and our minds.
Can the formal analysis of dreaming tell us something about how
our cognitive repertoire is restored? Do we lose memory for the
same reason that we lose thermoregulatory capacity – the
disablement of the aminergic systems on which both depend?
The net effect of resting and restoring the aminergic systems at
night is to strengthen our next day’s capacity for thermoregulation
and acquisition of information. Along with memory and
thermoregulation, we can therefore also ascribe alertness, attention,
and even analytical intellect to aminergic effectiveness. In Chapter
6 we take these possibilities a step further by discussing regional
brain activation.
Our dreams are emotional, and something that psychologists term
‘hyperassociative’, because our brains are activated by cholinergic
rather than aminergic chemicals. Thus, we restore the most
fundamental aspects of our cognitive capability – the capacity to
order our memories in a way that serves survival. Emotional
salience or relevance is a general mnemonic rule. Our level of
emotional competence has a high survival value and underlies the
more precise information needed to function socially. In other
words, we need, ﬁrst and foremost, to know when to approach,
when to mate, when to be afraid, and when to run for cover. These
78

are the skills that sleep refreshes every night of our lives by
activating our brains, with no regard for the details of declarative
memory (memory that is learned quickly and consciously). As
with thermoregulation, and immunity to infection, our instincts
to ﬂee, ﬁght, feed, and fornicate are crucial to survival and to
procreation.

Why dream? The functions of brain activation in sleep

79

Chapter 6
Disorders of dreaming

In this chapter, we look at the way in which the brain systems
mediating dreaming can become exaggerated or distorted, with
unwelcome consequences. Here, we are on the edge of the medicine
of sleep disorders, a topic of great interest to modern sleep science.

Nightmares and night terrors
Throughout this book, we have emphasized the important role
that brain activation in sleep plays in helping us to understand
human dreaming. The same rule applies to the understanding of
frightening dreams and nightmares. We have already emphasized
the fact that dreaming includes intense emotion, which is often
negative. In fact, dreams from which we spontaneously awaken are
characteristically dominated by anxiety, fear, and anger. So, in a
sense, the question of what causes nightmares is the same question
as what causes negative emotion in dreams. The answer is the same,
too. It is brain activation and, in particular, activation of an
important and ancient area called the limbic brain.
What kind of brain activation causes nightmares rather than
pleasant dreams? The obvious answer is that it must be the emotion
centres of the brain that mediate negative emotion that are
activated in nightmares, and activation of the emotion centres that
cause positive emotion determines the pleasant nature of other
80

dreams. Having said this, it is important to distinguish, in
traumatic dreams, the difference between night terrors and
nightmares.
Night terrors are pure emotional experiences that occur on
awakening from sleep. Typically, they are associated with non-rapid
eye movement (NREM) sleep, as are the recurrent dreams of
post-traumatic stress. Together with the arousal from NREM
sleep, there is intense activation of the heart, the breathing
rate increases, and the blood pressure may rise to extremely
high levels; the person awakens drenched in sweat and terriﬁed,
and often has little dream recall whatsoever from these
awakenings.

In night terrors, especially post-traumatic night terrors, emotion
may be the same as that experienced during waking, whether or not
there is any associated dream content. The brain is activated in
sleep and brain centres mediating emotion are preferentially
activated in sleep as will be made clear when we discuss brain
imaging data in Chapter 7. We can see, then, that nightmares,
however unpleasant, are normal events in sleep, suggesting that the
maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure
our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep.
Too bad we have to dream about it.
81

Disorders of dreaming

This is quite different from the more typical experience that most of
us have had at one time or another – to awaken from a dream in
which we were trying to escape from imaginary pursuers, absolutely
terriﬁed. In the second case, which is more likely to occur in
REM sleep, we have formed the perceptual scenario of an attack
situation from which we are attempting to ﬂee, and our emotion is
appropriate to the dreamed action. Figure 7 shows the activation
that is not in our control (i.e. autonomic activation) which is
normally associated with REM sleep. As can be seen, increases
in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate can begin in
NREM sleep.

REM sleep shown in detailed sleep-stage graphs of 3 human subjects (A)

sleep cycle is shown to illustrate the changes in eye movements (EM),
EEG, blood pressure (SBP), respiration (resp.), pulse, and body
movements (BM) that are associated with REM.

Sleep walking
Sleep walking, sleep talking, and tooth grinding are three of the socalled parasomnias, movement (or motor) behaviours that occur
unexpectedly during sleep. When we recall that the answer to so
many of our questions has been brain activation in sleep, it will not
82

be surprising to notice that all three of these motor behaviours are a
function of the activation of the movement systems in subcortical
brain tissue – the motor pattern generators (or MPGs) that are
referred to in Chapter 4. The motor systems that are activated are
activated over and above the ability of the brain to quell motor
output through inhibition.

Between these two extremes, in NREM sleep, activation of motor
command centres in the brain may occur that results in behaviours
such as sleep walking, sleep talking, and tooth grinding. These
motor behaviours are said to be ‘dissociated’ because normally they
occur only during waking. Now they are occurring during sleep, and
the assumption has been either that an awakening has occurred or
that the person is dreaming. Both are wrong. There is partial brain
activation – enough to support movement, but not enough to
support waking. These states are hybrids, with features of both sleep
and waking.
To understand this apparent paradox, we need to recognize that
movement is programmed by the brain at many levels. The upper
level of the brain, which gives us voluntary control over movement
during waking, is pretty much out of the loop during sleep. The
lower brain structures, many of which are necessary for movement,
83

Disorders of dreaming

During REM sleep, one of the most common dream experiences is
of imagined motion. To ensure that we do not move, the system has
to run an inhibitory, or blockade, process to stop the motor
commands, which are hallucinated by us as dream movement, from
resulting in actual movement. One of the ways in which the brain
guarantees no movement during sleep is through inhibition;
another is simply to dampen the use of the motor systems. This is
well known because, to fall asleep, we have to assume postures that
are immobile; we will not be able to go to sleep if we are unable to
stop moving. So, the very onset of sleep is dependent on disabling
the motor system. Later, when the brain is intensely activated
during REM sleep, motor output has to be actively blocked.

may, however, be activated while the upper brain is inactive. The
result is automatic movement, such as may be seen in heavily sleepfogged individuals who need to urinate getting up and going to the
bathroom or to some inappropriate place, such as the ﬂower
garden, where they attempt to urinate.

Dreaming

In performing such sleep-walking acts, these individuals are
partially aroused, but still deeply asleep in respect of the upper
brain. We know this from lab studies in which brain waves have
been recorded. The high-voltage slow waves of deep sleep continue
to be recorded while the individual sleep walks. One old wives’ tale
about sleep walking holds that it is a mistake to wake the person,
usually a young person, up from such episodes. The answer to that
one is to ‘go ahead and try’. It is usually impossible, but don’t worry
about it because, if you can’t do it or if you do succeed in waking
them, there will be no adverse consequence whatsoever.

Post-traumatic dreams
What effect does trauma have on dreams? There are two
paradoxically contradictory answers to this question: enormous
impact and very little. We don’t understand why, in some cases, the
trauma is almost always dominant and, in others, it has such a small
role to play in the shaping of dreams. One answer may be that
victims of trauma, e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder patients who
have had violent experiences in war, have a speciﬁc kind of
awakening experience. Their sleep is interrupted by terrors akin to
the night terrors of children, and, like in the night terrors of
children, these do not occur in REM sleep when normal dreaming
takes place. Instead, they occur in NREM sleep, the phase of sleep
in which the brain is less completely activated, but in which
powerful emotions can nevertheless make themselves felt.
Individuals who have had intrusive and disruptive trauma may have
intrusive and disruptive emotional experiences during sleep, which
create states of brain activation of their own. This encapsulation of
84

trauma leaves intact the normal physiological process of brain
activation in sleep that results in dreaming. This could help us
account for the fact that many individuals who have had traumatic
experiences (and I am one of them) never dream about that
experience at all – it just wasn’t strong enough to take on a mental
life of its own and it plays very little part in the construction of my
dreams.

Careful scientiﬁc studies of survivors of the Holocaust suggest
that all sleep is invaded by the horriﬁc replay of memories of
experiences. This fact, coupled with the ﬁndings of post-traumatic
stress disorder in veterans of military combat, suggests that, just as
waking thought tends to be dominated by preoccupations with
these unpleasant experiences, so does sleep mental activity tend to
be dominated by them.
We now need to carry out studies to ﬁnd out if awakenings
performed in REM and NREM sleep yield different reports. This is
important, not only to answer the question of how trauma shapes
85

Disorders of dreaming

I was assaulted on the street by three men and nearly killed by them
– my nose was blasted to smithereens and my nasal septum deeply
separated from my skull; I needed painful plastic surgery (without
anaesthesia). But this episode has never appeared in my dreams;
what appears instead are frighteningly aggressive confrontations,
although these appeared before the traumatic event as well as after.
This is not the least bit surprising or unusual. One of the things that
we fear most is being overpowered and assaulted by criminals or
bullies. That has been a part of the fear of my life ever since I was a
young child, so that in my dreams I may have what appear to be
recurrent episodes of confrontation with powerful enemies whom
I am helpless to repulse. I run away and they chase me, and
sometimes they may even catch me, as they did in the real traumatic
event that occurred. But then I wake up. They never go on and
break my nose in the way they did in my real life experience. In fact,
I rarely experience pain in my dreams.

dreaming, but also to answer questions about the function of
dreaming. We still don’t understand why the brain self-activates
during sleep, yet evidence suggests that it is certainly not only to
replay previous experience.

REM sleep behaviour disorder

Dreaming

The new kid on the dream disorder block is the REM sleep
behaviour disorder (RBD), a very strange syndrome in which
patients enact their dreams through movement. This is not sleep
walking, although it is what sleep walking was erroneously thought
to be. How does RBD come about?
The inhibition of movement or motor output, which normally
quells the movement commands of dreams, is only quantitatively
greater than the excitation of neurons that is the embodiment of
these commands. If either inhibition declines or excitation
increases, or both, movement will result.
In RBD, individuals (often middle-aged men who will go on to
develop the movement disorder parkinsonism) begin to enact their
dreams. One of my patients ﬂails his arms, and hits his wife, as he
dreams of driving a car and turning sharply on a curve. Another
imagines that he is at a swimming pool and dives off the bed.
In every case, the dream report given by the patient on being
awakened ﬁts with the motor behaviour observed during the REM
sleep dream. We know that these events occur in REM sleep from
sleep lab evidence.
This sounds very much like evidence for the one-to-one theory of
dream psychophysiology, proof of which eluded experimenters
in the 1960s. It also suggests that REM sleep physiology can be
pathologically distorted by inherent degeneration of the brain.
In the case of RBD, the system controlling the neurons
(neuromodulatory system) that is suspect is dopamine, a
86

chemical neurotransmitter which has an unclear role in normal
sleep.
We know that dopamine deﬁciency is the cause of parkinsonism
and that many RBD patients will develop this condition. Beyond
that, it is not clear what is going on, although it is clear that
prolonged use of a group of antidepressants known as the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can lead to RBD. This
suggests that serotonin, which is known to be a potent inhibitor
of REM, may interact with brain dopamine systems and upset
the balance between inhibition and excitation of the motor systems
in sleep.

87

Disorders of dreaming

Dreaming, like any other mental state, is subject to pathological
deformation. In Chapters 7 and 8 we explore this theme in more
detail and show how normal dreaming helps us understand the
organic (physical) basis of psychopathology, the organic basis of
dreaming itself, and how disorders of dreaming help us to
understand both normal dreaming and psychopathology.

Chapter 7
Dreaming as delirium:
sleep and mental illness

If dreaming and the psychosis of waking life are not dynamically
interchangeable in the sense of Freud’s model, how should we
conceive of the compelling analogy that exists between
them? After all, dreaming is a psychotic state, and it is as
psychotic a state as we ever experience while awake. The internally
generated perceptions have the hallucinatory power needed to
make us hopelessly delusional. In the face of their detail and
the powerful takeover of our minds, dream hallucinations
make it impossible for us to realize that we are in the grasp of
an altered state of consciousness. We are sure we are awake
and believe our senses – and the associated emotions – despite
the incongruities and discontinuities of dream bizarreness,
which, were they to occur in waking, would immediately tip
us off.
If these emotions occurred while we really were awake, our ﬁrst
reaction to improbable or impossible dream scenarios would be to
say ‘Pinch me, I must be dreaming!’. If that didn’t work, we might
try to wake ourselves up. Next, we might wonder if someone had
slipped a mickey in our cocktail, or whether one of the drugs we
were taking for high blood pressure or migraine or spastic colon had
side effects that our doctor had not warned us about. For sure, we
would wonder whether or not we were getting enough sleep.
We would probably do all these things before we concluded that
88

we should see a psychiatrist, although we would know that we were
going crazy for some physical reason or another.
This means that, formally speaking, dreaming and severe mental
illness are not only analogous but identical. This, in turn, means not
only that is it easy to imagine that physical changes in brain state
can produce psychosis, but also that the perfectly normal changes of
sleep have very dramatic effects on our mental capacities. What’s
going on here?

What kind of psychosis is dreaming?
Psychosis is, by deﬁnition, a mental state characterized by
hallucinations and/or delusions. It is very difﬁcult to hallucinate
without being deluded; we go into this ‘seeing is believing’ principle
in more detail later. But, as almost everyone knows, it is quite
possible to be deluded without hallucinating. Normal suspicion –
call it caution if you will – leads us to believe things about our
lovers, colleagues, and governments that are either completely
untrue or highly exaggerated. In other words, we don’t need to hear
voices to be paranoid, although it certainly helps.
Which natural class of psychosis is dreaming most like:
schizophrenia, major affective disorder (such as depression and
mania), or an organic mental illness, e.g. delirium resulting from
drugs or a high fever? If you are following my reasoning at all, you
will quickly realize that the answer is organic mental illness. And, if
you have any doubt, call the formal approach to your rescue.
89

Dreaming as delirium

Do we go mad each night to prevent ourselves from doing so in
the day time? Or do we go mad because the brain temporarily
gives up certain of its controls in order to regain them, in better
order, when sleep ends? We don’t yet know the answers to these
questions, although the evidence suggests that each has a grain
of a more complex truth hidden in this still incomplete line of
enquiry.

Begin with the dream hallucinations. What sensory modalities
do they use? Everyone will say ‘vision’ without hesitation.
Although visual hallucinations are quite rare in schizophrenia
and major affective disorder, they are the very hallmark of organic
delirium.

Dreaming

Move on to the delusions: these are exclusively cognitive/
intellectual and never paranoid as is typical of schizophrenia.
They are rarely related to the body (i.e. somatic) as they can be in
depression (a common feature of which is a mistaken conviction
about lost, defective, or diseased body parts). The grandiosity and
fearless elation of mania are shared with dream psychosis, although
these features are also found in organic delirium, especially in its
chronic, post-intoxication phase.
The clincher of the argument comes when we consider the
cognitive deﬁcits. When we are dreaming, times, places, and
people change without warning. This orientational instability is a
variation on the organic delirium theme of disorientation. Delirious
patients, similar to dreamers, know only who they are, not where
they are or what day it is, or even who is with them. In response to
the disorientation, which is caused by the recent memory deﬁcit,
the patient with organic delirium makes up stories that are not
lies but false beliefs, sincerely – and often fatuously – advanced to
cover the huge holes in memory. We call this trait ‘confabulation’.
Confabulation is not a word we usually apply to dreaming, but it
ﬁts. Fabulous is a related word, which is often used to describe
dreams.
When we elaborate dream plots, we are telling ourselves stories,
ﬁbs, white lies, and myths about ourselves. In fact, we are so
convinced that these myths are about the real us that we rarely, and
then only reluctantly, reach the conclusion that we are delirious
when we dream. In this view, it ought to be considered at least
possible that dream content is as much dross as gold, as much
cognitive trash as treasure, and as much informational noise as a
90

signal of something. This kind of proposal, which Robert
McCarley and I made in our original 1977 papers about the
activation–synthesis hypothesis, has never been popular.
There are, however, many other reasons to take the dreaming-asdelirium argument seriously. Even if you believe that the peculiar
utterances of your aunt with Alzheimer’s disease contain deep or
hidden meanings, you recognize that it is her loss of brain cells that
causes her to make so many of them. In fact, Alzheimer’s disease,
and its many degenerative ailment cousins, all affect neurons,
including the aminergic and cholinergic elements that we already
know to be functionally eliminated (the aminergics) or enhanced
(the cholinergics) in sleep. What I am saying is that not only are the
mental phenomena analogous, but also the brain mechanisms
underlying them.

The good news is that all we need to do to cure ourselves of dream
delirium is to wake up. This is a comforting thought in more
ways than one. It means that we can stop the music if we don’t like
it (as therapists treating anxiety disorders and depression have
discovered), but it also means that the concept of chemical balance,
always so seductive and powerful, but, until now, so vague, can
ﬁnally be speciﬁed. Mental state is a constantly negotiated
compromise between the poles of waking sanity and dreaming
madness. The following dream shows just how delirious my own
mind can become when my brain is inhibited by the aminergic
system and overstimulated by the cholinergic one.
91

Dreaming as delirium

Sounds bad, doesn’t it? Going to sleep entails the enabling of a
distinctive brain activation process akin to delirium: delirium is a
state that we thought we could get only by being bad or by taking
drugs such as alcohol, amphetamine, or atropine, or by outliving
our brains – in the senile conditions of old age. Suddenly we ﬁnd out
that it happens to all of us, every night of our lives, and probably
more when we are being good than when we are being bad, and
more when we are young than when we are old!

28/8/1983 A House Burning, Dream no. 32
I could see the smoke, just like when the sauna and, later, the
farmhouse caught ﬁre. This time it seemed again like the house but
it was in the wrong place (across the road) and when I pulled the
hose toward the source of the smoke, I was oblivious that it would
not reach. There was snow on the ground. I dropped the hose and
ran on to ﬁnd that the smoke was issuing from a chimney (at the
level of the ground) hence, no danger. This house – impossible in
every way – somehow ﬁt into the familiar complex of buildings that
is the farm of my dreams. There is one large barn whose repairs I
frequently contemplate – it does not resemble the real barn whose
repairs I also – in reality – frequently contemplate.
‘Who set this ﬁre?’ I inquired angrily.
‘A boy’ was the answer from a man faintly resembling a scoutmaster or teacher and – through his expression only – implying that

Dreaming

the ‘boy’ was Ian and that I should not be angry because of his
handicap. He had that professional, holier-than-thou sort of
patience that I myself some days evince when faced with irritated
parents of troublesome children.
‘He is around here somewhere.’
He was not but there was an abundance of well-meaning clinical
types, a veritable workshop of do-gooders all of whom were discussing
the wonders of kindness and love. This disarmed me only slightly. I
was still concerned about the ﬁre and eager to punish the ﬁre setter.
Suddenly, there was a complete scene shift. Beside a stream, with
rapid current and much white water, a ball (orange) is seen to shoot
out into the maelstrom. It will certainly be lost if it reaches the
waterfall. I call out to Julia, who is immobilized, at least to go to high
ground so as to plot the course of the ball. (She has been playing with
Karen Lavie who arrived that day with an orange ball.) Instead, she
plunges into the stream and, with a manly swimmer’s stroke, knifes
through the current, seizes the ball, and carries it out the opposite
bank. This seems, at once, miraculous and normal.

If this is not a delirious, psychotic experience, all of my psychiatric
training is worthless. I have visual hallucinations, delusions, strong
emotions (anger, anxiety, and elation), and, most deﬁnitely,
92

disorientation, and its close cousin, confabulation. This story,
which seems so crazy to my waking mind, seemed so normal to me
in the dream.

What happens to sleep in mental illness?

When patients are becoming psychotic, for whatever reason, sleep
is also likely to suffer, adding the risk of normal dream delirium
to that of a schizophrenic or affective psychotic process, because
individuals can be driven into states of delirium by extreme
sleep deprivation. Think of brain-washing, trance states, and
the confessions of treason extracted by political, psychological,
and cultural rituals. All involve sleep deprivation. In the end,
sleep-deprived individuals will do or say anything in exchange
for sleep.
Sleep loss is therefore common in and contributes powerfully to
the development of psychosis. In the case of schizophrenia (now
thought to be a disorder of excessive dopamine release and/or
heightened effectiveness of dopamine), we can hypothesize an
indirect but positive interaction with the other modulators of the
awake state, noradrenaline and serotonin, and a direct negative
interaction with acetylcholine. Signiﬁcantly for my dreaming-asdelirium thesis, no distinctive changes in sleep are seen in chronic
schizophrenia.
93

Dreaming as delirium

What does this tell us about the chemical imbalance theory?
Here again, most people can intuit the general answer. Anxiety
and other emotions (such as elation) that increase brain activation
of the waking type, impede sleep. They do so by increasing the
set-point for the aminergic systems, which mediate waking and
inhibit sleep. Besides causing insomnia, which is unpleasant,
these conditions also induce sleep deprivation or, at least, sleep
curtailment. And we know, from our discussions in Chapter 5,
that sleep deprivation may be positively unhealthy, not just
dysfunctional.

Dreaming

When we come to consider major affective illness, our story
becomes almost unbelievably enriched. In the ﬁrst place,
depression, which is now thought to be mediated by serotoninergic
and/or noradrenergic insufﬁciency, is characterized by a marked
tendency for REM to occur earlier, to be more intense, and to last
longer than it does in age-matched controls, or in the same patients
when they get well. This means that major depression, which is also
thought to be enhanced by cholinergic (acetylcholine) systems, is a
functional disorder of the very same neuronal systems that control
dreaming; by stretching the point a bit, it could mean further that
to be prone to depression is to be prone to REM sleep and vice
versa. The changes in the sleep of someone with depression, and
the presumed neuromodulatory basis, are shown in Figure 8. This
is a surprising conclusion because, as we have seen, dreaming is
unlike depressive psychosis and depression is unlike delirium!
How can we square these apparent discrepancies? The ﬁrst step is
to admit that we don’t know enough yet to do so. The second step
is to point out the most promising avenues of investigation. One
certainly arises from the fact that, although the most effective
antidepressant medications suppress REM sleep (by beeﬁng up
the depressed aminergic system and toning down the hyperactive
cholinergic system), they do so with quite a different time course.
The disorder of REM sleep is ﬁxed at once, whereas the mood
disorder may take weeks to respond. This means that sleep and
mood are linked by long-term, down-stream brain processes, which
we cannot yet describe but which almost certainly depend on
changes in gene expression.
Another promising lead is the immediate relief of daytime
depression by a single night of REM sleep deprivation. This
ﬁnding suggests that, if there is something already wrong with
mood control, REM sleep chemistry induces depression. Could
this induction of depression be mediated by the cholinergic
overdrive of REM? Perhaps, because we know that cholinergic
drugs that increase REM acutely make depression worse.
94

We are left with the tantalizing approximation of two models – one
controlling sleep, the other controlling mood – which are about to
collapse into each other, but not quite. Not yet. Those yearning for a
uniﬁed theory of brain and mind must exercise patience and be
satisﬁed that, in this case at least, the cup is well over half-full,
whereas only 25 years ago it was completely empty.

95

Dreaming as delirium

8. Many depressed patients experience an earlier onset of REM during
the ﬁrst sleep cycle. The ﬁrst REM period may also last longer and be
more intense than normal. The process is reversed by antidepressant
medications that strengthen the aminergic and weaken the cholinergic
systems.

Chapter 8
The new neuropsychology
of dreaming

Sleep lab dream research very quickly reached a point of
diminishing returns. This was because the one-to-one dream
content theory was too ambitious and too unscientiﬁc to
guide a physiological programme that was too superﬁcial to
provide detailed data about the brain. The result was a contentious
and unproductive period of sleep and dream research lasting
from about 1975 to 1995. Understandably disappointed, the
grant committees of the American National Institutes of
Health began to cut funding for sleep labs, especially those
that were engaged in descriptive, correlative work on
dreaming.
During this same period, neurophysiological work on sleep
in animals was proceeding apace, providing details about the
brain that could only be tentatively matched with human
psychology using the dream form theory. This failed to satisfy
many psychologists, who were understandably nervous about
the applicability to humans of cellular and molecular evidence
obtained in cats, and who were unable or unwilling to give
up the dream content theory. Believing that they had been
unfairly deprived of support, some psychologists, led by
David Foulkes, made a strong attack on physiologically oriented
dream research.

96

Brain imaging to the rescue

Before describing how this method works, I show how two
examples of dream formalism are explained by the brain imaging
data. They are intensity of the hallucinations (which is often much
exaggerated in dreaming) and directed thought (which is usually
diminished or completely absent in dreaming). By going far beyond
the spatial resolution of the electroencephalograph (EEG), brain
imaging allows us to record the regional brain correlates of
hallucination and thought. Studies using a form of imaging
called positron emission tomography (PET) show an increase in
activation of just those multimodal regions of the brain that one
would expect to be activated in hallucinatory perception (the
cortical areas of the parietal lobe, see Figure 9). They also show a
corresponding decrease in the activation of an area of the brain
known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (see Figure 9); this
brain area has been identiﬁed as the area of, or base for, working
memory, self-reﬂection, and directed thought. In other words, in
REM sleep – compared with waking – hallucination is enhanced
and thinking is inspired because of the shift in regional brain
activation.
How are such observations actually made? What relationship do
97

The new neuropsychology of dreaming

In the second half of the last decade of the twentieth century,
ofﬁcially declared by US Congress to be the ‘Decade of the Brain’,
brain imaging technology made it possible for the ﬁrst time in
human history to visualize the regional activation (and inactivation)
patterns associated with changes in conscious state. Chief among
these conscious state changes, and appropriately chosen as a ﬁrst
point of attack, were waking, sleeping, and dreaming. Although this
scientiﬁc approach is still young, it is developing rapidly and has
already revolutionized dream science by providing us with the
opportunity to compare our formal dream versus wake measures
with formal wake versus rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
measures of regional brain activation.

they have to what we already know to be the global changes in brain
chemistry and physiology underlying them?

Dreaming

If you have ever been referred for computed tomography (CT) or
any of many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that have
replaced X-rays in medicine and neurology, you have already
enjoyed the fruits of the brain imaging revolution. Both of these
techniques, and also PET, produce images of the brain itself – not
just the skull – by computing density differences in the tissue (CT)
or functional activation differences of the tissue (MRI and PET).
This takes advantage of the fact that the density of the brain is
altered by blood ﬂow, together with activation and inactivation of
neurons. Whenever neurons become more active, they require more
oxygen, which is supplied by increasing blood ﬂow to the activated
region. Scans from PET and functional MRI make ‘visible’ such
regional activations (and inactivations).
As computers are used to organize and manipulate the
three-dimensional data, it is possible to look at the activity of
many different brain regions, from many different angles,
simultaneously. The computer, under instruction from the
investigator, decides from what angle to take the image and at what
depth to focus its density analysis. It then produces a myriad of
pixels, or points that measure density, plots them in two dimensions
as a ‘slice’, and colour codes the density patterns to make them easy
to read qualitatively.
For research purposes, PET is attractive because it has relatively
high spatial resolution. It must be realized, however, that, even with
PET, we are not at the level of cells and molecules that is provided
by the microelectrodes and microinjection techniques used in basic
sleep research. So a gap still remains. We tolerate this gap because
PET tells us things that would take decades (or centuries) to realize
if we could use these microinjection techniques in humans (which
we can’t), and because we know that it is just a matter of time before
the gap is closed in animals.
98

Meanwhile we rejoice at the festival of ﬁndings obtained using PET
to study sleep and dreaming in humans. Table 3 shows the brain
regions that are activated (and inactivated) in human REM sleep
compared with waking, and compares the data with those emerging
from the analysis of changes in dreaming after accidental
destruction of the brain regions in question by disease, especially
stroke. To aid comprehension, consult Figure 9, which shows the
location of brain areas that are either hotter or cooler in REM sleep
than in waking.

These regional activation data are compatible with the formalist

Area of brain

9. Summary of PET study evidence of brain region activation in
NREM and REM sleep. Compared to the blood ﬂow distribution in
waking (a), the global decreases observed in NREM sleep (b) suggest
widespread deactivation consistent with the greatly diminished capacity
of conscious experience early in the night. In REM sleep (c), many
regions are activated about their levels in waking (solid black) while
others are deactivated (shaded).

view that dreaming differs from waking in being more internally
controlled, more hallucinatory, more emotional, and motivated
more by instinct than in waking. In comparing the respective mind
and brain forms of the two states, the dream scientist carries out a
subtraction. In the ﬁrst set of comparisons, we ask what parts of the
brain are more active in REM sleep and whether they correspond to
formal aspects of the mental state that are intensiﬁed in dreaming.

To see such striking correlations is almost too good to be true and,
in fact, they prompt us to consider a causal hypothesis in each case.
The reason that dreams are so perceptually intense, so instinctive
and emotional, and so hyperassociative is because the brain regions
supporting these functions are more active. The reason that we
can’t decide properly what state we are in, can’t keep track of time,
place, or person, and can’t think critically or actively is because the
brain regions supporting these functions are less active. Could it be
that simple? Why not? Much apparent complexity melts away when
science comes up with a correct simpliﬁcation. This is the true
meaning of reductionism.
Now we must recall that regional brain analysis of diminished
psychological function in dreaming shows an association with the
lack of noradrenaline and serotonin in the REM sleep-activated
brain – these two chemicals are known to be necessary for attention,
learning, and memory (and by implication for orientation and
101

The new neuropsychology of dreaming

Dreaming is also characterized by a set of related, cognitive features
that are deﬁcient compared with waking, including diminished selfawareness, diminished reality testing, poor memory, defective logic,
and, most strikingly, the inability to maintain directed thought.
Imaging experiments now tell us that the area of the brain called
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is normally activated in
support of functions in waking, is deactivated in REM sleep. In
other words, the subtraction in this case shows waking to have more
of both the psychological traits and the underlying regional brain
activation.

active reasoning). Reciprocally, we must say that the uninhibited
cholinergic system (active in this state) could contribute to the
positive signs mediated by the regional activation of the areas of the
brain involved with hallucinosis, hyperassociation, and
hyperemotionality.

Dreaming

The story keeps getting better and better. We might even wonder
what is left for a psychology of dream content to do. In Chapter 11
we return to this issue but, for now, let us simply say that all of the
features of dreaming that Freud wanted to explain with his wishfulﬁlment, disguise–censorship theory are explained in just the way
he hoped might ultimately be possible – by the physiology and
chemistry of the brain.
Can we take our programme of integration a step further? Possibly.
Suppose, for example, that the changes in regional brain activation
during REM sleep in humans were somehow related to the shift in
the modulation of the neurons, which could quite possibly be valid,
because if blood ﬂow is controlled by such modulators in the rest of
the body, surely they should also do so in the brain. In other words,
a simple way of effecting the complex pattern of regional brain
activation and inactivation would be to change the balance of the
modulation of neurons, so changing blood ﬂow and then activation
of the neurons. It is likely that modulators affect neuron function by
both direct (synaptic) and indirect (vascular) actions. It won’t be
long before we get an answer from brain science.
The main point is that we can now see our own brain in action,
something that I could only dream of 15 years ago.

ﬁnd out what had been causing this thing!’ And, lo and behold,
there was a cause – a large balloon-like mass (or was it air?) pressed
the brain down into the lower third of the skull. It was concave on
its surface.
When I looked closely at the left hemisphere, I noted that it was
moth-eaten which explained my difﬁculty (almost certainly agerelated) in remembering speciﬁc names. I was interested, but not
frightened by what I saw; I was not the least bit aware of the
paradox (tangled hierarchy?) that I was looking at my own I
(= brain). For such a thing to occur there must, of course, be two
brains – but then, the brain-within-the brain will sufﬁce.
I recall saying ‘Now, wake up so that you can recall this
remarkable scene!’

The lucidity with which I was able to waken myself up makes this

know, attempt to induce it. Instead, it simply read out my

Does brain damage cause changes in dreaming?

Dreaming

As a result of the conceptual and political split between psychiatry
and neurology caused ﬁrst by the mind–body problem and deeply
aggravated by Sigmund Freud’s inadvertent dualism, it took dream
science an inordinately long time to notice that cerebrovascular
accidents (better known as strokes) and epileptic seizures (better
known as ﬁts) could cause decreases and increases in the formal
features of dreams, respectively.
Strokes occur when cerebral blood vessels close (as a result of
arteriosclerotic plaques) or are blocked (by emboli – small blood
clots usually coming from the heart). Strokes prevent the affected
brain regions from receiving the oxygen that they need to do their
job. A complete loss of dreaming can occur when there is damage to
tissue in the brain known as the multimodal sensory cortex (part of
the parietal cortex) or to the deep frontal white matter of the brain.
Table 3 shows the reader that these are among the structures
selectively activated in REM sleep, which is almost certainly not a
coincidence. It indicates that these two regions are necessary for
dreaming to occur.
You can activate the brain in sleep in whatever way you like, but you
will not produce the psychological experience of dreaming without
activating the parietal cortex or deep frontal white matter. Why
not? Are these restricted and discrete brain regions the brain’s seats
of dreaming? Probably not. More likely they constitute connections
allowing other brain regions to communicate with one another in
such a way as to sustain dream consciousness.
When strokes are centred in the visual regions of the occipital
cortex – again in associative rather than in primary processing
zones – patients may report dreaming without visual imagery. To
understand this ﬁnding we must realize that when visual stimuli,
encoded by the retina, reach the primary visual cortex some simple
properties of images (such as edges or bars) are represented but the
104

Do blind people see in their dreams?
The answer to this question depends on whether the blindness was present at birth or acquired later in life.
People who are blind from birth have no visual imagery at
any time, neither in waking nor in dreaming, and this is
because their visual systems have never had the necessary
interaction with the perceptual world to develop perception
or the encoding of visual images. Thus, when their brains are
activated during sleep, they are unable to call up images
vision is not the only modality in visually impaired individuals; bodily sensations or the sense of position of the body
in space is markedly enhanced, and enhanced in proportion
to the loss of cues given by the visual system. So these individuals do have other hallucinatory dream experiences, just
in a different mode from the visual.
People with acquired blindness have had previous vision.
Their brains have developed perceptual capacities and the
capacity to recall the images. They can create images awake
with their eyes closed and they can create elaborate images
when their brains are automatically activated during sleep.
In fact, dreaming is the time when people with acquired
blindness see most clearly. This recalls the question of
Leonardo da Vinci: ‘Why does the eye see a thing more
clearly in dreams than when awake?’
One of our blind participants told us that he was particularly
pleased to see in his dreams because he could revisit his

blindness could and should be taught to recall their dreams
and even to shape their content, because they can have
convincing perceptual contact with family members long
after they stopped being able to see them in the wake state.

complexity of whole images (houses or people’s faces) are built up
and represented elsewhere. There are more than 20 such secondary
or associative visual areas in the cortex.
Epilepsy is an abnormal condition in which the normal activity of
affected brain regions may be enhanced as well as impaired, and so
constitutes an experiment of nature that is the opposite of stroke.
Ever since temporal lobe epilepsy came under experimental
scrutiny – at the hands of the Montreal neurosurgeon Wilder
Penﬁeld and his neurophysiologist colleague Herbert Jasper – it
was known that direct electrical stimulation of the human temporal
lobe could produce ‘dreamy states’ not unlike those associated with
spontaneous seizures.
These epileptic states were ‘dreamy’ precisely because they shared
some formal features with normal dreams – they could be
hallucinatory, hyperemotional, cognitively confused, and difﬁcult
to recall. Now that we know that the temporal lobe is selectively
activated in REM sleep, we are bound to ask ‘Is this just another
coincidence?’ The answer, again, is probably not. We need to take
seriously the idea that REM sleep, which has pulse-like activity
brought about by cholinergic systems, is provided with electrical
stimulation to the temporal lobe; this spreads to nearby
connected structures and causes us to have dreamy states similar
106

to some aspects of epilepsy as well as to some aspects of
psychosis. In both cases the mediating mechanisms are speciﬁably
physical.
As with the imaging work, which complements almost perfectly
what happens in dreaming, this aspect of neuropsychology is very
new, very young, and very undeveloped. We can expect much more
information as other aspects of the effects of brain damage on
dreaming are investigated. What we can say unequivocally at this
point is that, of course, since dreaming is a brain function, brain
damage will affect it. How could it be otherwise?

Dreaming, learning,
and memory

The idea that dreaming is involved in the reorganization of memory
has been around for at least 30 years, but only within the last ﬁve
has a strong, clear line of evidence been developed. One of the
most important scientists working in this area is my colleague
Robert Stickgold, and it is his work that forms the backbone of
this chapter.
The basic hypothesis, for which evidence was previously
consistent and positive but not impressively robust, is that rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep subserves consolidation of memory.
This hypothesis is appealing because the brain is activated and
dreams are composed of memory fragments. This hypothesis
has been borne out by recent experiments, although it now
appears that non-REM (NREM) sleep is equally important. More
interestingly, the dream–memory plot has thickened in two
important ways:

Thanks to progress in cognitive neuroscience, the learning and
memory processes that sleep may affect have been better
characterized and differentiated.
Thanks to progress in basic sleep neuroscience, the brain dynamics
that appear to support the differentiated aspects of learning and
memory are now known in enough detail to allow modelling of the
sleep learning processes.
108

As I have constantly repeated throughout this book, we need,
always, to maintain a distinction between dreaming as a
conscious experience and REM or late-night NREM sleep,
the physiological states of the brain underlying the conscious
experience. Just as REM sleep can run without our ever
remembering dreams, so – we suppose – can learning and memory
reorganization take place without our ever being aware of it. The
best we can hope for is that our new, formalist approach to
dreaming might help us to understand the rules of memory
reorganization.

REM sleep and learning in animals

In the ﬁrst theory, sleep was measured after exposure to new
learning, and REM sleep was found to increase as learning
increased. In the second theory, REM sleep was prevented; this
impaired learning. In both cases, the focus was on REM sleep. In
the case of the post-exposure theory, the increase in REM sleep was
often surprisingly delayed and time-limited, leading Carlisle Smith
to propose the concept of a ‘REM sleep window’ for the
consolidation of learning. This concept is akin to critical periods in
development, which also involve learning, and which may also
involve REM sleep because that state is so prevalent in immature
animals.
As far as dreaming is concerned, the data that are most relevant to
considerations of the timing of learning and of a REM sleep window
109

Dreaming, learning, and memory

Two complementary theories were adopted in the early days of
studying sleep and learning in experimental animals. Rats were
used for this work because cats, despite much more being known
about their brains, are such poor learners. Cat owners will object to
this invidious comparison – surely their beloved pets are at least as
clever as rats. But cats are domesticated and don’t need to learn
much to survive. Rats are still wild and need to adapt to much more
difﬁcult life conditions.

in humans are the surprising delays in incorporating new location
data reported by travelling dream recorders such as Michel Jouvet
and the systematic lab work on the dream incorporation of
experiential data by Tore Nielsen. As mentioned earlier, both
sources indicate that it may take several days, even a week, for
the brain to get around to using new information to change
its mind. It is thus clear that, in considering behavioural
repertoires, we are confronting long-term processes and we
should not expect to ﬁnd that all post-exposure learning takes
place overnight.

Dreaming

How can recurrent dreams be explained?
Dreaming has remarkably consistent features from individual to
individual and from night to night. We call these features formal to
indicate the difference from what we call content. By formal, we
mean that dreams are visual and intensely emotional, have a
peculiar logical quality, and times, places, and people are inﬁnitely
plastic and changeable. In other words, dreaming is recurrently
bizarre, and it is the recurrence of the bizarre features that we think
determines the assumption by most people that the content is
repetitive.
We know that content itself can be repetitive, especially in the case
of traumatic dreams, which we discussed in Chapter 6. But when we
ask normal inidviduals to produce records of the recurrent dreams
they claim to have, we are impressed by the fact that what is
recurrent is the formal features, e.g. anxiety may be a common
element to dreams. Well, anxiety about what? Anxiety about exams,
for example. That’s not a bit surprising if we think that anxiety or
emotion play a large part in dream construction. What things are
people anxious about? They are anxious about performance and
performance evaluation, and what performance evaluation is more
stressful or important to people than exam performance?
Consequently, we may have exam dreams as one of the recurrent
themes.
110

It may seem to the reader that we are attempting to explain away
rather than explain recurrent dreams, but this is not the case. What
is recurrent are certain emotionally salient themes that depend on
certain formal properties of dreams, and these are deeply repetitive.
Every dream is characterized by visual perception and strong
emotion, most often elation, anger, or anxiety. With these emotions
come our own historical experiences – the experiences that are
associated with these emotions are likely to appear in our dreams.

Human learning and memory
The distinction between learning and memory is particularly
clear in the case of procedural tasks that expose individuals to
sensorimotor challenges – some of which are met entirely outside
our awareness.
On a task of visual discrimination – the Karni–Sagi task, for
example – individuals improve their performance without knowing
how or why (as they learn the task); after sleep they then do better
111

Dreaming, learning, and memory

Exam dreams are, however, often quite different from one another
in orientational detail – they take place in different rooms and
different places, and concern different subjects. What they all have
in common is the dreamer’s feeling that he or she is unprepared.
This is not unusual in life, especially in the lives of busy, competitive
people. In dreaming, it may be related to the fact that we have a
great deal of difﬁculty vocalizing our thoughts. In other words,
another formal feature of dreaming is the inability to remember. It
is rare in dreams to remember something; it is strikingly peculiar
that, although dreams are loaded with memory fragments, we
don’t stop in the middle of the dream and say, ‘Hey, that reminds
me of something’ or remember, for example, that one of our dream
characters has recently died. It is this defect in thought, added to
the coupling of anxiety to one of its most common associations, the
fear of failure, that may determine what an individual calls his
recurrent exam dream.

Dreaming

when re-tested (again without knowing how or why). On the
visual discrimination task (or VDT) individuals must ﬁx their gaze
on a symbol, an ‘L’ or a ‘T’, at the centre of the screen and then
indicate when an aberrant stimulus array (\\\ instead of ///) is
ﬂashed in another part of the screen. As is usual in cognitive
science, reaction time is the measure used and, within an hour of
training, most individuals become very fast at this subliminal
recognition.
Despite not knowing consciously how they do it, people get quite
good at this task and improve markedly during training sessions.
Improvement is measured by the achievement of a high percentage
of correct judgements as the time of stimulus exposure is reduced.
We don’t think of this as memory (and it may have little or nothing
to do with dreaming), but it is probably typical of most of the things
that we learn and so it is quite important. In other words, we learn a
myriad of procedures without being able to describe them verbally.
Most learning is unconscious. We call this kind of learning
procedural memory to distinguish it from episodic and semantic
memory.
The next day, when they are re-tested, Karni–Sagi subjects’
performance correlates strongly with how they slept. If they have
been deprived of REM sleep, they behave as novices showing no
advantage of their previous exposure. If they sleep deeply early in
the night and/or have long REM periods late in the night, they
retain their learned skill and may even improve on it. The greatest
improvements occur when both deep early night (NREM) and long
late-night (REM) sleep are present. As can be seen in Fig. 10, the
correlation between the product of the two sleep measures and
improved performance is almost one. Suitable controls, for lapsed
time and for sleepiness, show that it is sleep itself that confers the
beneﬁt of skills improvement.
This result is important for several reasons: one is that it is robust;
another is that it is highly replicable; a third is that, because it is
112

entirely unconscious, it cannot be faked; a fourth is that the
learning probably takes place in a restricted area of the brain that
can be speciﬁed – the primary visual cortex – which makes the
experimental theory amenable to study using imaging techniques.
Unfortunately, it is not a task that rats can learn so we cannot easily
expose the cellular neurobiology of the sleep beneﬁts. As for cats,
forget it!

Dreaming itself and learning
People who never master the Karni–Sagi task do not dream of
taking the test in any way that relates to their competence. Are there
waking–learning experiences that are so strong that they are in
evidence within the mental state/thoughts of sleepers? We have
previously alluded to the reports of skiers and sailors who notice a
return of the illusion of movement of skiing or sailing at sleep onset.
We also know that mental experiences at sleep onset are dream-like.

10. Visual discrimination task learning. (a) Correlation of
learning with slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep
(REM) across the night. For each quartile of the night, the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient between SWS% and overnight improvement
(ﬁlled squares) and between REM% and overnight improvement (open
circles) was calculated. (b) Two-step model of memory consolidation.
Improvement is plotted as a function of the product of the amount of
SWS during the ﬁrst quarter of the night and the amount of REM in the
last quarter. Both amounts are quantiﬁed as percentages of the entire
night. The strong correlation suggests a two-step consolidation process,
including an early, SWS-dependent process and a late REM-dependent
one.

Are dreams caused by indigestion?
Certainly not. The theory that dreaming is caused by indigestion was introduced in the nineteenth century by scientists
who were otherwise unable to explain activation of the brain
during sleep. They thought that such activation must come
from external stimuli. Of course, if one has a stomach ache,
or has eaten or drunk too much, the processing of the food
and resulting chemical disturbances are likely to lead to
awakenings, and these awakenings may be associated with
dream recall. When one is lying asleep in such states of
gastrointestinal brain activation, it is not unlikely that
mental content will be related to the dietary indiscretion.

Dreaming

This might mislead us into thinking that the dreams were, in
general, caused by those external stimuli.
In fact, a day’s external events have very little place in
the genesis of dreams. Freud thought that dreams were
triggered by recent memories, but we ﬁnd that recent
memory enters into dreaming very little. Fragments of
episodic memory of biographical events are incorporated,
but whole recollections are never reproduced as such.
Instead, only partial fragments of recent memories enter
into dream construction and, along with other materials
from remote memory, become part of scenarios created
entirely from scratch as brain activation proceeds.

So, we may have to settle for sleep-onset dreaming if we want to see
the effect of learning on mental content. If we are willing to accept
this gift of nature, we may be able to learn from it, as our recent
studies of novices learning the video games Tetris and Alpine Racer
have taught us.
114

Individuals who are learning to play these popular games typically
report intrusive game imagery at sleep onset – in other words, in
sleep they still have declarative or episodic memory of their
learning. This indicates, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the
brain has made a retrievable record of its experience, held it in
‘memory’, and replayed it later under the altered conditions
of sleep. This gives us a very desirable handle and marker of
waking experience that can be tracked in the brain as sleep
proceeds.

Now brain activation in sleep can be seen in an entirely new light. It
does – sometimes at least – reﬂect previous experience. ‘Of course it
does,’ you say. ‘I always thought that would be true.’ But how could
you be sure? And how could you ﬁnd out exactly what was done
with that day’s experience by your brain without a label or a
marker? Now that we have one, we are in a much stronger position
to ask such questions as the following:
1.

2.

As declarative memory (memory that results from conscious
awareness and associations) depends so strongly on an intact
hippocampus, are our daytime experiences temporarily stored
there for further processing?
Are bits of declarative memory, but not entire scenarios, transferred
out of the hippocampus when the brain is reactivated in REM
sleep?
115

Dreaming, learning, and memory

Fortunately, there is an animal model for this phenomenon.
Rats who are learning maze navigation will often show correlated
ﬁring of neuron pairs in the area of the brain known as the
hippocampus, and this ﬁring increases as they learn, as if neurons
were making a physical link to represent the animal’s orientational
maps. The cross-correlation re-emerges at sleep onset, as if the
rat’s brain, like the brain of the Tetris or Alpine Racer player, was
repeating in sleep the cerebral code from its daytime experience.
The cellular and molecular basis of this phenomenon can now be
studied.

While waiting for a more systematic answer, consider this
helicopter dream which illustrates many of the points about
memory that I am trying to make.

Dreaming

14/7/1977 Helicopter, Dream no. 3

The day I took Chris to Pisa I saw two helicopters low over the
outskirts of the city. That night, I dreamed of two helicopters going
the other way. Then they appeared to be landing in our pasture
in Vermont (Chris had suggested, the previous day, that planes
sometimes landed in high mountain Alps – which I doubted).
As one helicopter neared the uneven ground I noticed that the
pilot was Roger Horn (exhibit designer for Dreamstage)! I cried
out – in that silent way of dreams – to him to be careful and
suddenly, very suddenly, the helicopter became a tractor, a farm
tractor with big wheels which, on hitting the ground, ﬂew apart, one
large wheel rolling wildly downhill while the rest of the tractor
veered to the left with Roger now running behind.
Like a Chaplin ﬁlm, it was all very choppy and comical – but
frightening at the same time. Roger and the tractor now parted
company and I watched as Roger ran headlong into the wall of a
shed which he thumped with his noggin giving a resounding crack
and then a reeling recoil of a dazed Roger.
116

What the brain does, instead, is to keep a rather impressive
record of experience for a relatively short time, probably in the
hippocampus and directly related cortical structures, which is
accessible for about one week by day but inaccessible by night.
This model can explain how and why I never dream of daytime
117

Dreaming, learning, and memory

With our experimental data and dream reports such as this, we are
now in a position to create a new model of learning in sleep and
dream memory that transcends all existing technical analysis. In
the dream example given, the emotional salience (or importance) of
peril, triggered by the helicopter observation, integrates two other
perilous subjects: tractor operation in Vermont and my vulnerable
friend, Roger. It is already clear that the brain does not store
information like a tape recorder, a microﬁlm ﬁling system, or even
content-addressable memory – in other words, it doesn’t simply
take experience and lay it down somewhere in its depths for future
reference.

experiences that are easy to recall the next day. The brain uses sleep
to make bit-by-bit adjustments in its long-term repertoire of
learning and memory, in a way that guarantees both efﬁcacy and
efﬁciency.

Dreaming

Take efﬁciency ﬁrst. Suppose my brain, as Freud and many of his
followers have assumed, kept a detailed record of everything.
Nothing would be forgotten. There is simply not enough storage
capacity for this model to hold. All the evidence is against it. And
it wouldn’t work very well either. How would retrieval proceed?
I would need a virtually inﬁnite look-up system that would be
extremely costly in time and space as well as physically impossible.
Instead, my brain reworks my memories into a much more general
fabric of inclinations to act and feel in certain ways in response to
certain stimulus conditions.
As far as efﬁcacy is concerned, this is a model of procedural
memory with more than a sensorimotor aspect, because it includes
considerations of instinctive priority and emotional salience. It is
thus the Freudian unconscious broadened and made user-friendly.
No longer a cauldron of dread desire, my unconscious procedural
repertoire is both rich in sources and ready to respond. I don’t have
to think about most of what I do. It just happens: automatically,
appropriately, and adaptively. My emotional brain ‘knows’ that
helicopters, Vermont tractors, and nervous exhibit designers have
something in common.
But I do need a conscious declarative memory system too, and it
needs to be ample, accurate, and updatable, especially around
issues of orientation.

Who am I and who are the key people in my life?
Where am I and how do I ﬁnd my way to places of importance to

When did this or that prominent event happen?
What is my current programme, and what are my goals for the future?
118

This is the conscious aspect of my mind and, although I want it to
work as well as the unconscious does, I am willing and able to
tolerate constraints and to elaborate props and tricks to make it
work. For example, I use my journal to keep a record of my
experience in time, my address book to keep in touch with the
locations and phone numbers of key people, and my schedule book
to plan the future. I simply can’t remember all that stuff. I don’t
want to and I don’t need to if I use these memory aids.

119

Dreaming, learning, and memory

My dreams reveal how procedural and declarative memory systems
intersect and interact in sleep. They always show respect for the
universal aspects of my behavioural repertoire and they treat the
orientational details in a relatively cavalier fashion in order to
achieve efﬁciency – they trade precise historical accuracy for global
emotional associativity. In other words, my dreams reveal how little
detail of my daily experience – but how much of the emotional
salience – gets mapped on to my procedural repertoire. After all,
most of the details are redundant anyway. I already know who I am,
who my key people are, where I live and work, and what I have
done, am doing, and intend to do in the future.

Chapter 10
Dream consciousness

In his approach to dream interpretation, Freud’s emphasis was on
the unconscious mind, where that mental agency was viewed as a
constantly threatening, barely restrained collection of socially and
psychologically unacceptable desires. In turning this idea on its
head, and viewing the unconscious mainly as an ally, and a guide to
survival and socially sensible reproduction, we are redeﬁning the
unconscious in a way that demands a new view of consciousness in
general and of dream consciousness in particular. This chapter is
designed to describe how modern sleep science has contributed to
the dramatic progress of the last decade in understanding the brain
basis of consciousness, and how that understanding has caused us
to shift our model of dreaming in the direction of altered states of
consciousness that have been recognized – and celebrated – since
the psychedelic era of the 1960s.
Before taking up these two themes, we need to deﬁne consciousness
in a way that is compatible with the formalist approach to
dreams and with the cognitive neuroscience approach to its
brain basis.
Consciousness may be simply – and unarguably – deﬁned as our
awareness of the world, our bodies, and ourselves. The last quality,
awareness of ourselves, includes awareness of awareness, the
knowledge that we are conscious.
120

Consciousness is a brain function with both global and
compartmental aspects. It succeeds in so far as it is a unitary
state that integrates many different aspects of the brain–mind.
Some of these are listed in Table 4. (See Figure 11 for physical
orientation.)

There are two important models embedded in Table 4. One is the
sequential processing model, beloved of the reﬂex theorists. The
sequential model says that all neural information processing,
including consciousness, proceeds from the outside in and from
the bottom up; it passes through an integrator at the top and
then proceeds down and out again. The other is the modular
approach, which is used by neurologists who wish to assess
mental states, cognitive neuroscientists who wish to understand
parts of the mind, and dream formalists who share both the
clinical goals of the neurologist and the physical approach of the
scientists.

11. The structure of the human brain

A central problem for anyone faced with this set of modular and
sequential processes is to understand how conscious unity can be so
effortlessly achieved. At any moment, we are aware – or about to be
aware – of many information sources, and yet our conscious
experience feels very seamless, smooth, and focused. This quandary
has been called the binding problem, and theorists have approached
it in a variety of ways – by ‘binding’ is meant the knitting together
of disparate elements into a seamless whole. For starters, consider
the ﬁve senses that may contribute to our construction of a
perception. Most scientists assume that synchronicity of the
many brain regions contributing information to consciousness is
achieved via rhythmically harmonious activation of the many
direct connections between them. This explains, up to a point, the
unity of conscious experience, although it says nothing about how
122

that experience is actually achieved or how that very unity can
change – as it does regularly when we dream or take certain drugs.
These normal and artiﬁcial alterations in consciousness require
another quite different binding mechanism, one that chemically
unites the many brain parts underlying the components of
consciousness. It is my contention that such chemical uniﬁcation is
achieved via the inﬂuence of the chemically coded neurons of the
brain stem (neuromodulation). Sleep science has shown that
neuromodulation changes dramatically when our conscious
state changes from waking to dreaming. The model of aminergic–
cholinergic interaction thus constitutes a basis for understanding
the alterations of consciousness normally experienced every day,
although it also helps us understand those that may be induced by
drugs, or arise unbidden in mental illness.

Qualia and the hard problem: mind and body
as one
I myself believe that even the hard problem, the problem of qualia,
and the mind–body problem itself, are effectively solved once we
123

Dream consciousness

Binding via synchronicity occurs in milliseconds to seconds.
Binding via chemical modulation occurs in minutes to hours. We
need both, and we must make the best of both until we understand
the mother of all questions: how does the synchronous and
chemically coherent activation of brain cells result in conscious
experience in the ﬁrst place? How, after all, is the nervous system
involved in subjective experience – what the philosophers call
qualia – and what David Chalmers dubs ‘the hard problem’?
Chalmers asserts that neuroscience has not yet, and may never,
solve the hard problem. If you love a mystery, and want to avoid the
implications of what neuroscience is saying, you have a way out
here. Neuroscientists are no more believable than anyone who
waves his hands and says ‘And then a miracle happens’. The brain is
a colony of neurons: it thinks and therefore it is.

know that the world is represented in the brain by two reciprocal
processes: the ﬁrst is the a cause-and-effect mechanism of selforganization that brings us into the world, at birth, with a high
degree of self-determination. This is genetically arranged. The
second is our experience of the world through which we enter
symbolic representations of experience into our circuits of neurons.
This is achieved behaviourally.

Dreaming

Both of these processes, the innate and the acquired, have examples
in the speciﬁc activation programmes of the brain. Viewed in this
way, waking and dreaming are mirror images of one another which
interact throughout our lives to create consciousness in the ﬁrst
place and to endow it with information for purposes of adaptation
as we live out our lives.
You may feel that we are still short of explaining a mechanism for
awareness or for the awareness of awareness. Think with me for a
minute about how we see and, then, how we see that we see. In
the case of reﬂexive (automatic) vision, the eye encodes various
aspects of light in the ﬁring patterns of its retina (inner layer); these
signals are sent on to the brain where they are integrated as wholly
abstract, but highly speciﬁc and meaningful, representations of
the world (as images). So far, I suppose, no one doubts the model.
If you do accept this model, however, the mind–brain problem is
effectively solved. The visual world is nothing but a sequence of
activation patterns of neurons representing images. It is only one
step to the representation of this representation (i.e. awareness)
and one more step after that to representing the awareness
(i.e. awareness of awareness) and we are fully conscious. Each
step involves the activation patterns of neurons.

Dream consciousness
What does dream consciousness tell us about all of this? It tells us,
beyond the shadow of a doubt, that our brains are capable of an
impressively rich state of consciousness without the aid of any
124

instantaneous input from the world or output to the world. Again
we know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the state of dream
consciousness depends on brain activation in sleep – activation,
including its properties of high-frequency synchronization and
chemical neuromodulation, which is best provided by REM sleep, a
brain state that exists before waking and upon which waking always
depends. Of course, the converse is also true – at least as far as
dream content is concerned. We need conscious experience in
waking to represent it as such in our dreams, and we need language
to give dream consciousness its narrative character and to make
dream reporting possible.

Bridge, Dream no. 7–8/1977
Last night, a terrifying bridge dream: Ian, Chris, and I are in the
station wagon going up a ramp. We go off and land on a parapet –
precarious but solid. I get out and go for help. This entails dropping
off the parapet – some 40 feet down into water, into which I sink
some 20 feet before touching bottom. Then I go up, like a shot, and
try to get back in the car via a ramp. But it is one-way. Somewhere
along the way, a man is lifting cars with ease.

Inspired by Llinas’ bold theorizing, let us consider two related
issues that are enlightened by dreaming of this sort. One is the
125

Dream consciousness

What about the formal aspects of dreaming? Are we not now
entitled to claim that they are innate? Built in to our brains in the
womb? Already functioning, at that early stage, to provide us with
the organizational structure from which full consciousness will
emerge? And doesn’t that at least open the door to the possibility
that some components of consciousness are in place well before
others? In suggesting that the sensorimotor self-activations of the
brain may be forefathers of the concept of qualia, I follow Rodolfo
Llinas, who tracks qualia all the way down to single neurons.
Consider the following report, noting especially its movement
components.

What is lucid dreaming?
In most dreams, we are convinced that we are awake. But,
sometimes, dream events are so incredible as to make us
wonder. This disbelief can be increased and converted into
the recognition that we are, in fact, dreaming. By lucid
dreaming, we thus mean the reacquisition during dreaming
of an important aspect of waking consciousness that is
usually lost, mainly the accurate recognition of the state that
we are in. When we are awake, we know it and we can check
on our knowledge very easily. We are able to make voluntary
movements; we are able to control our thoughts; we are able,
if we are sceptical, even to pinch ourselves and see that we

Dreaming

feel things and are behaving in relation to external stimuli.
In dreaming, we normally lose this self-reﬂective awareness;
we are unaware of the state that we are in; we are unable to
control our thoughts; and we are unable to make critical
judgements.
During dreaming, some individuals become spontaneously
aware that they are dreaming. This occurs naturally in
children who are aged eight and above, and continues
through adolescence. Later, it is difﬁcult to rely on
spontaneous occurrence of self-awareness during dreaming
sleep. Lucidity can nevertheless be induced, and it is induced
by techniques that anyone can follow. I put a notebook by
my bedside along with a pen to record dream experience and
then, before going to sleep, I tell myself that, being a normal
human being, it is likely that I will have two hours of absolutely fabulous dreaming tonight. To tune in on some of it I
am going to notice when bizarreness occurs. I tell myself to

126

notice things that could never occur in waking but typically
occur in dreams, namely the changes of times, places, and
people (especially the unusual occurrence of unidentiﬁed
characters, characters with the qualities of one person who
suddenly have those of another, and so on). This ﬂuidity of
the orientation functions – time, place, and person – is what
is going to tell me that I am dreaming.
When I am successful, a part of my brain–mind wakes up and
I am able to notice that I am dreaming and say so to myself.
Having done so, I have created a kind of dissociation: part of
my brain is in the waking state and part is in the dreaming
state. And then I can have a lot of fun. I can watch the
and, best of all, I can inﬂuence the dream content. I can do
whatever I please; well, almost whatever. I can certainly ﬂy
and can have whatever sorts of intimate relationships I
choose with my other dream characters. This is usually
enough to make people quite proud and pleased to have
achieved lucid dreaming.

perpetual sense of movement and the other is whether ‘I’ am the
agent of that movement. It is I who jumps from the Dream Bridge. I
drop 40 feet into the water; I go up ‘like a shot’. But such dream
movement is entirely virtual. It is ﬁctitious. How can this be? We
don’t really move at all but are completely convinced that we are
doing so. This means that Llinas is getting very warm indeed when
he claims that the sense of self is embedded, at an early stage and an
elemental level, in the capacity of colonies of neurons to generate
movement patterns. Although this does not entirely explain how the
sense of self arises, it goes a long way to solving a problem that is
otherwise difﬁcult to manage: if ‘I’ am not the agent of movement,
127

Dream consciousness

dreams, I can induce awakenings so as to increase my recall,

who, or what, is? The environment? Sensation? A reﬂex? It just
doesn’t make sense to think that way unless you are really lazy and
want God to do it all!
The one orientational anchor that is never lost in dreams is
the self, the ‘I’ who dreams, the I who thus swims, ﬂies, ﬂees,
makes love, fears, and ﬁghts. True, some dreamers see themselves
as dream actors (rather than being the centre of the action),
but the self is always there. It is the construct of constructs,
the organizational unit of consciousness. I dream, therefore
I am.

How does dreaming alter consciousness?
Table 5 is designed to answer this question easily. In fact, Table 5
is a summing-up of facts that you already know, although it is
important to be sure that you review them and that you have one
last chance to refute or refuse the formalist approach before we turn

to interpreting dreams. Ask yourself whether or not these claims
apply to your dreams.
It is now possible to compare these brain functions with the brain
regions speciﬁed in Table 4 to make our point about how these
alterations are effected.
We begin by dispensing once and for all with the reﬂex model. The
ﬁrst (sensation) and last (action) are of entirely internal origin.
The reason for this is twofold: ﬁrst the input–output gates are
closed by active inhibition; second, the central representations of
sensation and movement in the cortical and subcortical brain are
self-activated.

Attention requires special comment. Dreams seize our attention
and constantly co-opt it. We are so often surprised by the sudden
turn of dream events that we cannot pay them the attention that
they would command if we were awake. We assume that this
attentional defect is partly a consequence of parasitic percepts
arising spontaneously, but it may also spring from the lack of
voluntary movement control that limits our ability to move and to
think. We are awash in our own cognitive secretions, including
129

Dream consciousness

As percepts depend on sensations and voluntary movement
depends on muscle tone, perception (item 2 in Table 5) and volition
(item 9) are altered secondarily. In the absence of external
sensations, perception is derived from the self-activation of
multimodal sensory areas of the cortex and related subcortical
brain areas. Recall that formal vision, like images of houses and
people’s faces, is the responsibility of multiple and far- ﬂung cortical
areas. Some of these are linked to subcortical systems, such as the
limbic lobe for example. So we can, at last, begin to imagine how
our brain conjures up dream images through the self-activation of
REM sleep. We suppose that the decision to act may also be
impaired by the weakening of working memory, which we discuss
soon. This explains, in a summary way, four of the ten items.

Dreaming

elements of our own sensorimotor programme that are being run
in rapid succession whether we like it or not. We thus suppose
that attention in dreaming consciousness is weak for two reasons
that are additive: one is a consequence of the disinhibition of
sensorimotor programmes by aminergic systems; the other is
the regional deactivation of the area of the brain called the
frontal cortex.
Emotions (feelings) and instincts (primitive behaviours) are both
enhanced by the activation of the limbic brain in REM sleep. In
REM sleep, certain areas in the brain (namely the amygdala in the
temporal lobe and the white matter of the base of the forebrain)
are turned on. This is a ﬁnding on which all brain imaging studies
conducted to date agree. This is Freud’s ‘id’, and conﬁrmation of
its activation by modern neuroscience allows us afﬁrmatively to
include instinct and emotion as major instigators of dream plots.
We can even agree that dream consciousness owes its often
primitive character to ‘release’ of these brain programmes from the
inhibition that holds them in check during waking. In this view,
the ego/super-ego equivalents are the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, which constitutes the ‘I’ that decides (in waking) whether
or not to promote real-life scenarios, culminating in instinctive
behaviour. In dreaming consciousness, that I is asleep (as Freud
suggested). Items 4 and 5 of Tables 4 and 5 can thus be understood
in neurobiological terms.
Thought (item 6) and orientation (item 7) are both impaired by
disablement of the aminergic systems and regional deactivation of
the global and local memory systems of the brain. We want to know
more about why declarative memories, which are presumably
stored in the hippocampus and then moved out to the cortex, are
so seldom available to dream consciousness. Clearly, all cognitive
functions that depend on memory, except possibly emotional
salience, are weakened in REM sleep. Dream consciousness is
therefore both a poor analyser and a poor organizer of its content.
Hyperassociativity and emotional salience are the rules that govern
130

dream consciousness, not linear logic and speciﬁc, accurate,
historical detail.

When we are dreaming, even without the help of the chemical
uniﬁcation conferred by noradrenaline and serotonin, and even
without the focus and control of thought and action conferred by
the part of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, our
experience is nevertheless convincingly integral and convincingly
real. Here again, it is hard to resist the idea that the ultimate reality
of consciousness includes, and is strongly based upon, our brain’s
capacity to create a virtual reality, so close in all of its formal details
to aspects of waking consciousness as to fool us, almost every time.

131

Dream consciousness

Putting it all together – integrating all of these disparate elements
into a credible dream plot – is the job of what’s left of the executive
‘I’. Here we are on thin ice because we don’t really know how the
dream scenarios are composed, any more than we know how ideas
are generated in waking. We emphasize narration because the
reports we have of dreams read like stories. This is dangerous
because the reports are necessarily given in waking and rely entirely
on language, whereas the dreams themselves are experienced more
like ﬁlms. They are multimedia events, including ﬁctitious
movement of a type not yet stimulated easily, even in the most
technically sophisticated ﬁlm. Only virtual reality, where the
subject’s own movements affect perceptions, comes close to this
dream experience. Thus, we use the term ‘narration’ advisedly to
signal the coherence of dream experience, which is all the more
remarkable given the apparent chaos of REM sleep dreaming.

Chapter 11
The interpretation of dreams

As this book has proceeded, I have ﬁrst knocked Freud down,
then picked him up again, dusted him off, and put him back on a
pedestal. But it is not the same pedestal on which I would want to
place our own dream theory. How can we now summarize the
similarities and differences of the views of modern neuroscience
with those of Freudian psychoanalysis? My colleague Bob
Stickgold puts it well when he says, ‘Freud was 50 per cent right
and 100 per cent wrong’. In this ﬁnal chapter we unpack this
paradox, hoping to make clear what speculative philosophy
can and cannot do, and to show that only experimental brain
science can hope to correct any picture of ourselves based on
intuition alone.

In what way was Freud 50 per cent right?
Cutting to the chase, what did Freud get right? His discussion of
dreams correctly emphasized their primitive emotional character.
Dreams are indeed instigated by the release in sleep of primitive
drive mechanisms of the brain, and these primitive drive
mechanisms do include the instinctive media of sex, aggression, and
escape. The feelings that go with approach behaviour (elation, joy,
happiness, love), avoidance behaviour (fear, anxiety, panic), and
confrontational show-down behaviour (ﬁghting, assaulting,
shooting) are also all there. This is what Freud called the ‘primary
132

process’, to distinguish it from the tamer, more civilized and
rationalized secondary process of waking consciousness.
But there is a lot less sex than Freud assumed and a lot more of the
negative emotions than he was prepared to deal with, because he
placed so much inﬂuence on dreaming as wish fulﬁlment.

Using this rebus (or set of rules), Freud was also correct in insisting
that much more of waking consciousness than we were prepared
to accept comes from our instinctive/emotional brains (or, as we
would now say, our limbic systems). Moreover, we can expect to
learn more about this part of ourselves by paying attention to our
dreams and, perhaps, by using dreams as starting points in tracking
associative trains of thought back to their imagined source in our
instincts. I say ‘perhaps’ because this assumption has still not been
proved. Even after 100 years of psychoanalytic practice, we have no
empirical evidence for the power of dream content (over, say,
waking fantasy or even neutral word list stimuli) to trigger
associative trains of emotional salience. Indeed, as I soon insist,
emotional salience is always the order of the day (or night) when
it comes to associative thinking.

133

The interpretation of dreams

So much for aspects of his theory that concerned dream instigation.
Was there anything right about his theory of dream plot
construction? Emotional salience and hyperassociativity would
seem to answer this question afﬁrmatively. In other words, we see
that Freud was correct in his basic assumption that dreams are
(in part) driven by instinctive force (emotions) and that these
emotions are loosely connected to mental content. Certainly the
one great legacy of psychoanalysis is its emphasis on the importance
of feelings, so often relegated to a secondary role by rational
psychologies and philosophies. Dreaming does remind us
emphatically that we have very powerful instincts, emotions, and
even inclinations to madness that must be held in check during
waking hours.

Dreaming

In what way was Freud 100 per cent wrong?
Freud’s model of the unconscious was similar to Victorian sexual
behaviour: the unconscious was seen as compelling, but sneaky and
devious. In dreams, the unconscious wishes were always trying to
disrupt consciousness, just as duplicitous sexual behaviour of
waking was designed to dupe social convention. Thus, Freud’s
dream theory adopted the fatally ﬂawed assumptions of disguise
and censorship as the basis of dream bizarreness. The primary
drive of the dream had to be expurgated or laundered and
converted into the apparent nonsense of dream bizarreness.
This idea that only the remembered dream content was manifest
and that it concealed a dormant instinct is the very heart of
psychoanalytic dream theory. Without it, there is nothing left,
except the emphasis on instinct and emotion. If, as we suppose,
dreams reveal rather than conceal emotion and instinct,
disguise–censorship is not only unnecessary but misleading.
In fact, it is downright erroneous.
Without disguise–censorship, what is there left for an
interpretation of dreams using a psychoanalytically constructed
theory? If the dream-inducing instincts are not disguised and
not censored, but entered into the dream plots directly, then
the manifest dream is the dream, is the dream, is the dream!
All we need to do in this case is to record our dreams and read
the reports carefully! By carefully, I mean with an eye to
associations, which may be remote and obscure, but meaningful
to the construction of an historically honest view of ourselves.
In this view, the so-called latent dream content is nothing more
or less than the vast set of associations connected to each aspect
of dream content. It could still be quite useful to investigate these
as a way of learning more about parts of our mind that are
important to us, whether or not we think of them as dream
instigators or as elements that, precisely because they are of direct
and undisguised emotional salience, get used in dream
construction.
134

Are men’s and women’s dreams different?
We were very surprised when we conducted a study of
emotion in dreams in a group of male and female college
students. We had fully expected that the emotion proﬁles of
these two groups would be as different as they are thought to
be during the waking state. We expected men’s dreams to be
more aggressive and more violent and women’s dreams to be
more afﬁliative and tender, but we found that this was not
the case, at least in our participants. The emotion proﬁles in
dreams of men and women were strikingly similar.

women to have visual imagery in their dreams, very little
difference in the tendency for them to have bizarreness in
their dreams, and, most strikingly of all, there is very little
difference in the incidence or intensity of the emotions.
What this suggests to us is that the emotional intensity of
dreams is something that is a given – it is a brain-based
phenomenon that is experienced similarly by both men and
women.
Through their biology and social interactions, men and
women learn during waking to direct their emotional
energies in different ways. Women are often more concerned
with child rearing and child protection, and men are more
often concerned with wage earning and competitive interactions with their peers. As a result of shifts in gender, these
behaviours are changing as we speak. But what apparently
doesn’t change very much is the representation of emotions
in men’s and women’s dreams. Emotional salience is equally
important to both sexes.

135

The interpretation of dreams

There is very little difference in the tendency for men and

Although dream emotions are the same in men and women, they
are associated with highly individual content. It is in this spirit that
the interpretation of dreams – particular dreams of speciﬁc
individuals – can still ﬁnd a place in personal psychology and
psychotherapy. In all likelihood, this is probably what has been
going on in psychodynamic psychotherapy anyway.
Consider the following report of mine, which is as relevant to the
physiological discussion of Chapter 4 as it is to the question of
individual meaning raised here. I suppose that I am the only person
in the world who could have had a dream with this content.
12/3/1980 Homage to Jouvet, Dream no. 12
I arrive at a meeting (probably the New Mexico APSS meeting in
1969) and am greeting colleagues. Suddenly I notice that Jouvet is
Dreaming

there. He recognizes me and smiles broadly (not his usual greeting).
I am about to call out to him when I suddenly lose muscle tone in
my legs and sink to the ﬂoor. I cannot communicate and feel lost.

In my journal, following this report, I wrote the following
comments:
•

•

Limp legs: I ﬁrst heard the French expression for this on the day that
I went to a romantic rondezvous that needed to be discreet, to the
Hotel de Beaux-Arts in Villefranche. When I returned to the lab,
Jouvet said that I looked like I had les jambes coupées – an
expression used to describe one who is sexually exhausted. My
excuse to Jouvet for leaving the lab had been to meet my old friend
D.B. at the main university library. I told Jouvet that D.B. had
developed a foot fetish attachment to J.S. and that there were jokes
about D.B.’s homosexuality. But there was nothing homosexual
about my rendezvous at the Hotel de Beaux-Arts and Jouvet
probably sensed that.
Jouvet’s smile: a beginning reconciliation after almost ten years of
tension over personal and professional rivalry. Note that I had
136

•

worked in Lyons in 1963–64 and that this dream occurred in 1980.
Japan (1979) was the ice-breaker. Mexico (1980) will be the
clincher. Jouvet’s break with Hernandez-Peon – a Mexican friend
and rival – began in Lyons when I was there in 1962. Today, I
received a cordial letter from Jouvet – formal, but cordial.
Atonia: Jouvet’s great discovery, the abolition of muscle tone
associated with REM sleep, is represented in my dream cataplexy.
Like narcoleptics in real life, strong emotion – especially
surprise – produces atonia. Perhaps I now recognize Jouvet’s
achievement in my behaviour.

Science demands prediction
As Douglas Hofstadter has pointed out in his brilliant book Gödel,
Escher, and Bach, the science of dream content interpretation
founders on the rock of prediction. It is simply inadequate to
conduct only retrospective analysis. Everything seems clear – and
convincing – in the retrospectroscope. I dreamt of Jouvet because I
had just seen him. OK. There is some evidence that antecedent
events may form dream crystals around which the dream story
forms. And, for sure, I am concerned about his feelings towards me
and well aware of his important discoveries. So this ‘interpretation’
(I prefer to call it a discussion) cannot be a vindication of
disguise–censorship because I am consciously aware of all of
the anxiety-engendering conﬂicts that it depicts.
Could I predict this or any other dream that I have ever had? If
137

The interpretation of dreams

Are these interpretations valid? How can I know? Certainly, I share
the psychoanalytic patient’s feeling that the interpretations ‘ring
true’. But this is the ‘tally argument’ so successfully demolished by
Adolf Grunbaum. The fact that these associations are meaningful
to me and that they possess compelling emotional salience confers
no validity on them, either as dream instigators or accurate
explanations of why I dreamed this dream, or that this is what this
dream really means!

there really were rules governing each and every dream plot, and I
really knew those rules, I ought to be able to do so. My guess is that
I cannot and that you cannot. If after you have had the dream
you can assign cause, your dream interpretation is subject to the
post-hoc fallacy that demolished the logic of your interpretation.
And mine!

Dreaming

Two caveats will help to make this point clear: one is the obvious
failure of many, or even most, of our emotionally salient experiences
to trigger dreams. As far as we know, and our knowledge is
admittedly limited, there are many salient people, events, and
impulses that we never dream about at all.
As an ambitious academic, I do have dreams about exam
unpreparedness, credential inadequacy, and lost slides, misplaced
lecture notes, being late, and the like. I call these ‘incomplete
arrangement’ dreams and shortly offer an explanation of them.
But I never, and I mean never, dream of sitting at my desk, writing a
paper, or reading a review critical of my grant application, even
though I have those candidate dream stimuli all the time. Why don’t
they enter into my dreams? They are certainly emotionally salient.
They concern survival, attack, defence, and all the rest. In other
words, a scientiﬁc dream theory has to explain why a whole class
of emotionally salient experiences cannot be a dream stimulus.
Instead of these themes, I dream of related problems, which rarely,
if ever, happen.
The other caveat is that the human mind is designed to see dream
causality even when it could not possibly be present. How do we
know this? By means of an experiment called dream splicing
that was conceived by Robert Stickgold and carried out by our
lab seminar group. We took 10 dream reports and cut them
apart – with scissors – at the point of dramatic scene shifts in the
plots. The resulting 20 dream fragments were then ‘spliced’. We
reassembled them so that one half were assembled as reported and
138

the other half as hybrids, their two halves coming from different
dreams in different people. There was no way in which events in the
initial segment of the hybrid dreams could be causally related to
events in the second segment.
Before this experiment was conducted, I was one who ﬁrmly
believed that I could see meaning in the sequence of dream
subplots, even across scene changes. But as soon as I tried to decide
whether a given report was spliced or not, I realized that I could
not tell. Nor could anyone else. Even highly trained, practising
psychoanalysts failed the dream-splice detection test if a scene
change was involved. This simple experiment raises many
disturbing questions:

•

Why are we so sure that we can understand a person by knowing
his or her history?
Why are we so sure that any text can be read with the assumption
of causal continuity?

In both cases – which are common, everyday occurrences – we have
the same problem as the dream interpreter. We must project causal
narrative structure on to events as a matter of course. It must be
a category of mind to look for, and to ﬁnd, causality in nature.
Fortunately for us, it is often there. That’s why we have survived
and that’s why science has progressed despite the errors into which
our tendency to project narrative causality plunges us. But, we make
at least as many mistakes in assigning causality as we make correct
inferences. Sometimes we are able to see this, although usually not.

Dream science
The scientiﬁc method was designed to protect us from these
errors of projection. A scientiﬁc experiment is an exercise in the
elucidation of cause and the best experiments unmask false
causation as much as they demonstrate true causation. In so far as
our new dream theory is true, we can predict that brain activation of
139

The interpretation of dreams

•

a given chemical and regional type will always produce hallucinosis,
hyperassociativity, hyperemotionality, false beliefs, and other
cognitive errors. This is as far as scientiﬁc prediction can now go
with dreams, but it’s far enough to put the formal psychological
analysis of dreams out of the reach of content analysis.

Dreaming

We do not dream because our unconscious wishes or drives would,
if undisguised, wake us up. We dream because our brains are
activated during sleep, and we do so even if our primitive drives
are turned on by that activation. In fact, such drives are not
concealed. Rather, they are revealed in dreams. It is the
speciﬁc neurophysiological details of that activation process,
not psychological defence mechanisms, that determine the
distinctive nature of dream consciousness.
Dream interpretation extends beyond its own narrow borders.
We are all engaged in a kind of dream interpretation all the time.
Why did so and so say such and such? Why do I feel anxious
when I pick up the telephone? Why do I become angry at my
daughter-in-law? Our experience with the interpretation of dreams
shows us that it is dangerous to assume causality and that our
answers to these questions had better not be just local and narrow,
and analyse only dream content.
What we need now is a set of truly general rules that help us to
accept our dreams, our fears, and our rages for what they are:
expressions of brain activation in sleep and in waking that have
their own deep and compelling reasons for being. In the twenty-ﬁrst
century we will learn much, much more about these deep reasons
from brain research.

140

Conclusion

If the question is how do we understand the mystery of dreams, the
simple answer is that there is no longer any mystery – at least no
mystery worthy of the creation of mystical dream theories of the past.
Surely, the work of sleep science is incomplete. We still do not know
enough about how the brain–mind reorganizes itself during sleep and
how dreams might be used for better understanding of this function.
But, clearly, we know that these details are far more likely to reveal
progressive, adaptive information processing during sleep than we have
previously imagined possible.
In the place of dream mystique, we aim to install dream science. And
the dream science we intend to install has a solid and broad base in
neurobiology. The recent development of dynamic brain imaging
technology, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), makes this
project particularly promising. For the ﬁrst time in human history, we
can see the regional activity of the brain as people wake, sleep, and
dream. This is a true renaissance, a genuine revolution, and a major
shift in the scientiﬁc theory of the brain and mind is to be anticipated.
As I have endeavoured to point out, nothing less is at stake than a
scientiﬁc theory of human consciousness. As we already know that
consciousness is a brain function, and that the state of the brain
determines the kind of consciousness we experience, we can begin to
build a model of conscious state determination on our solid and broad
141

base in brain science. Thus, the study of dreaming can be seen as a
crucial part of a much larger project, one that will shake the foundations
of philosophy, psychology, and psychiatry.

Dreaming

The study of dreaming is inextricably linked to the science of sleep.
The science of sleep is inextricably linked to neurobiology. Thus, the
science of dreaming is inextricably linked to neurobiology. So far, what
have we learned about these linkages? We can summarize our progress
by reviewing these important conclusions.
The ﬁrst important conclusion is that dreaming, and other states of
consciousness, are related to changes in the level of brain activation.
Brain activation varies in a systematic manner during sleep and peaks of
this function are highly correlated with dreaming. But, even the troughs
of brain activation in sleep are far from the total inactivation intuited via
introspection. In other words, the brain is always more active than not.
Even when consciousness abates entirely, the brain is working in an
impressively complex way. What is it doing? Important answers to this
question are processing information, consolidating and revising
memory, and learning newly acquired skills. This means that
consciousness in both waking and sleep occurs only at the upper levels
of brain activation, say 90–100 per cent.
The second important conclusion is that, independent of activation, the
brain opens and closes its gates. But these are not the ‘Gates of Horn
and Ivory’. They are the gates of sensory input and motor output. Thus,
as the brain self-activates in sleep, it shuts its gates so that outside
information has difﬁculty accessing the brain. It is equally difﬁcult for
the sleep-activated brain to realize the motor acts that it generates. We
experience them consciously as dream movement, but they are not,
fortunately, read out as movement. What this means is that the sleepactivated dreaming brain is off-line to normally effective inputs and
outputs. It is doing its own thing, as it were. In this case, that thing is the
very active processing of the sensorimotor and emotional data that we
are consciously aware of as dreaming.

142

The third and perhaps most signiﬁcant conclusion is that the brain not
only self-activates and isolates itself from the world, but it changes its
chemical climate very radically. In particular, two of the chemical
systems necessary to waking consciousness are completely shut off
when the brain self-activates in sleep. Without noradrenaline and
serotonin, the dreaming brain cannot do certain things such as direct
its thoughts, engage in analytical problem-solving, and remember its
activities. It is this difference in brain chemistry that probably
determines the differences between waking and dreaming
consciousness.

143

Conclusion

None of these ﬁndings was predicted by dream theorists, before
discoveries started being made in the second half of the twentieth
century. But they all have enormous impact on the way that we think
about our conscious experience. Without such knowledge, we were
groping in the dark. With it, we can begin to shine light on our most
interesting human attribute – consciousness.
