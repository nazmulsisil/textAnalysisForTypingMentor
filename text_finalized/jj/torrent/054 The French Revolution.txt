Preface

To produce a very short book about a subject on which one has
written at varying lengths before is more of a challenge than it might
seem. We can all think of people who have ‘written the same book’
several times over in different forms; and we all dread becoming like
them. So I have not set out primarily to retell a familiar story, although
anything calling itself an introduction must to some extent do that.
My concern has been much more to discuss why the French Revolution
mattered, and has continued to matter in innumerable ways in the
two centuries since it occurred. The whole story of the Revolution,
both as a series of late eighteenth-century events and as a set of ideas,
images, and memories in the minds of posterity, is a powerful
argument for the importance of history, as well as a striking example
of its complexity. Whether it will remain as relevant for understanding
the twenty-ﬁrst century as it was for the nineteenth and twentieth
is perhaps, as a Chinese sage is reputed to have observed, too early
to say.
The ﬁrst time I studied the French Revolution seriously was in my ﬁnal
year as an undergraduate. It was lit up by the providential appearance
of Norman Hampson’s Social History of the French Revolution. I am not
surprised that it is still in print as its author enters his eightieth year.
Later it was my privilege to be Norman’s colleague at York. In
gratitude for that, and the years of friendship since, I dedicate this

book to him. I hope he will not ﬁnd association with a work slighter
than any of his own the least welcome of what are sure to be many
birthday presents.

Chapter 1
Echoes

‘Mr Worthing,’ says Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest
(1895), ‘I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me. To
be born, or at any rate bred, in a handbag, whether it had handles or
not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of
life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.
And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?’
Presumably Mr Worthing did. Every person of good general knowledge
in the nineteenth century knew something about the great upheaval
which had marked the last years of the eighteenth. Serious Victorians
would have felt it a duty to instruct themselves about what had
happened in France, and why, in and after 1789; and how the ensuing
turmoil had been brought to an end only by the generation-long ‘Great
War’ against Napoleon which had marked the lives of their parents or
grandparents. Mr Worthing, nibbling his cucumber sandwiches and
dreaming of marrying Lady Bracknell’s daughter, would not have been
so curious. But probably even he would have had some idea of what the
worst excesses of the French Revolution had been, and of how they had
affronted life’s ordinary decencies. He would have known that there
had been a popular uprising leading to mob rule, the overthrow of
monarchy and persecution of the nobility. He would have known that
the chosen instrument of revolutionary vengeance was the guillotine,
that relentless mechanical decapitator which made the streets of Paris
1

run with royal and aristocratic blood. The creator of Mr Ernest Worthing
and Lady Bracknell (her ancestors, had they been French, could scarcely
have hoped to avoid the dread instrument . . . ) ended his days in
morose exile in Paris. There, Oscar Wilde was surrounded by symbols
and images deliberately designed by the rulers of the Third Republic to
evoke the memory of the First, the Revolution’s creation. The coinage
and public buildings were emblazoned with the slogan Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity. On festive occasions the streets ﬂuttered with red, white, and
blue bunting, the colours of the tricolour ﬂag adopted by the French
Nation in 1789. On 14th July each year a national festival celebrated the
fall on that day in 1789 of the Bastille, a forbidding state prison stormed
and then levelled by the people in the name of liberty. At such moments
of public jubilation French patriots sang the Marseillaise, the battle
hymn of a war against tyranny launched in 1792. And undoubtedly the
The French Revolution

greatest sight in Paris when Wilde lived there was the world’s tallest
building, the Eiffel Tower, the centrepiece of a great exhibition which
had marked the Revolution’s ﬁrst centenary in 1889.
Nobody who lived in France, or visited it, could avoid these echoes; or
echoes of Napoleon, who had marched under the tricolour, had tamed
and harnessed the energies unleashed by the Revolution, and whose
nephew Napoleon III had ruled for 22 years before the Third Republic
was established. Nobody who knew anything of France even at second
hand (if only through learning what was still the ﬁrst foreign language of
choice throughout most of the world) could fail to imbibe some sense
that this country had been marked by a traumatic convulsion only just
beyond living memory. Many believed, or felt, that this must have been
for the best and somehow necessary. Everybody knew and was shocked
by the story of how Queen Marie-Antoinette, guillotined amid popular
jubilation in 1793, had said ‘Let them eat cake’ when told that the
people had no bread. (Everybody knows it still, and nobody cares that it
was an old story even before she was born, heard by Jean-Jacques
Rousseau as early as 1740.) New nations have been proud to proclaim
their emancipation, or to anticipate it like the patriots of Brussels in
2

1789, or Milan in 1796, by adopting tricolour ﬂags. This banner of liberty
still ﬂies from Rome to Mexico City, from Bucharest to Dublin. Poles,
who ﬁrst sang the Marseillaise in 1794 as they resisted the carve-up of
their country, sang it again in 1956 in revolt against Soviet tyranny. In
1989, as France commemorated the Revolution’s 200th anniversary, the
same anthem of deﬁance was heard in Beijing, among the doomed
student protesters in Tiananmen Square. Few countries have failed to
experience some sort of revolution since 1789, and in all of them there
have been people looking back to what happened in France then and
subsequently for inspiration, models, patterns, or warnings.

Cross-Channel perspectives
Most detached from all this have been the world’s English-speaking
countries. Their last revolutions, except in Ireland, took place before
1789, and even English-speaking contemporaries who sympathized with
in 1688, or America in 1776. In any case such sympathizers were always
in a minority. The mould for most English-speaking attitudes was cast as
early as 1790, some years before the Revolution’s ‘worst excesses’, by
Edmund Burke’s Reﬂections on the Revolution in France. Outraged at the
claims of reformers that the French were merely carrying on the work of
the ‘Glorious’ British revolution of 1688 and the American rebels whose
cause he had supported in the 1770s, Burke asserted that the French
Revolution was something entirely new and different. Earlier revolutions
in the anglophone world had sought to preserve a heritage of liberty
from attack. By the new French standards, indeed, they had not been
revolutions at all; for the French were seeking to establish what they
called liberty by wholesale destruction. With caution, and respect for
the wisdom of their ancestors, they might have corrected the few and
venial faults of their former institutions, and come to run their affairs as
freely and peaceably as the British ran theirs. But they had chosen to
follow the untried dreams of rationalizing, self-styled ‘philosophers’
who had sapped faith in monarchy, the social order, and God Himself.

the French saw them as catching up with liberties proclaimed in England

The result had been anarchy and the envious rule of the ‘swinish
multitude’. Burke predicted worse to come, and foretold that it would
take a military dictatorship to end it all. Even he did not foresee how
bloody matters would become, but he was right about the eventual
triumph of a general. Burke came, therefore, to be revered as a prophet
as well as a critic; even if the superiority of the British over the French
way of doing things seemed only to be fully vindicated 18 years after his
death, on the ﬁeld of Waterloo.
But the French were incorrigible, and in 1830 the tricolour was unfurled
again over a new, though briefer, Parisian revolution. Why had it
come back to haunt the future? As the generation that had made or
experienced the original cataclysm died away, historians began to
appropriate it for analysis. Most of them are now forgotten, and the one
The French Revolution

who is not commands little respect among later practitioners of his
craft. But Thomas Carlyle did more than anyone else to ﬁx the popular
idea of what the French Revolution was like. In his wild, inimitable style,
The French Revolution. A History (1837) painted a vision of mindless and
vengeful chaos. He did not follow Burke in trying to defend the ancien
régime, the order that the revolutionaries destroyed. He thought it was
rotten, and deserved its fate. While courtiers minced, and windbags
prated, the hungry masses brooded on their oppression: ‘unspeakable
confusion is everywhere weltering within, and through so many cracks
in the surface sulphur-smoke is issuing.’ The Revolution was an
explosion of popular violence, understandable if scarcely defensible
resentment. Those who attempted to lead or guide it were mostly
simpletons or scoundrels, all to be pitied for their presumption. The
most frightful ﬁgure of all was Robespierre, who tried to rule through
terror, and who was now ﬁxed forever in non-French minds as the ‘seagreen incorruptible’ (in reference to his complexion as well as to his
power). He sent his victims to their fate, and ﬁnally followed them there
himself in tumbrils (a half-forgotten word for a tipping cart, never
afterwards used except in this context). ‘Red Nightcaps howl dire
approval’ as the tumbrils pass: this means sansculottes, men who did

not wear aristocratic kneebreeches but ﬂaunted their patriotism with
red caps of liberty. They and their screaming womenfolk were driven on
by visceral lust for social revenge. Carlyle only recognized three men as
capable of directing these forces of nature. One was Mirabeau, whose
death in 1791 left his promise unfulﬁlled. Another was Danton, who
saved France with his energy from foreign invasion in 1792, but was
engulfed two years later by the terror: ‘with all his dross he was a Man;
ﬁery-real, from the great ﬁre-bosom of Nature herself.’ (At the time of
Carlyle’s writing, Georg Büchner was presenting German speakers with
Dantons Tod [Danton’s Death, 1835], a play in which Danton is depicted
as too heroic a ﬁgure for the petty beings like Robespierre who
combined to kill him.) Finally there was Napoleon, who brought the
army into politics in 1795, ending the last Parisian insurrection with a

The French Revolution

‘whiff of grapeshot’.

Dramatic depictions
The idiosyncratic vigour of Carlyle’s writing leaves an impression
of years of ceaseless turmoil, with blood and violence, merciless
‘sansculottism’, and baying mobs a daily sight. It was irresistibly
dramatic. But Carlyle also had an eye for the pathos of innocent victims
falling prey to forces men could not control. Even Robespierre receives
a twinge of sympathy as he rumbles towards the guillotine in his new,
sky-blue coat. The book thrilled and appalled its readers, and it sold,
as well as read, like a novel. Novelists themselves admired it, and none
more so than Charles Dickens.
Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities (1859), in fact, offered by far the most
inﬂuential image that posterity has of the French Revolution. From
Burke it took one of its underlying themes – the contrast between
turbulent, violent Paris and safe, tranquil, and prosperous London. But
Dickens’ most obvious guide and inspiration was Carlyle. From him
comes the lurid picture of a cruel and oppressive old order, a world
of ‘rapacious licence and oppression’, where harmless and innocent
6

victims can be conﬁned by the whims of the powerful to years of
imprisonment without trial in the grim and forbidding Bastille; where
a nobleman can think the life of a child killed under the wheels of his
coach can be paid for by a tossed gold coin. Worthless authorities rule
over a wretched and poverty-stricken population aching with social
resentment, in which Madame Defarge, impassively and implacably
knitting, plans for the moment when revenge can be visited on her
family’s noble oppressors. The Revolution provides that moment: ‘ “The
Bastille!” With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been
shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth
on depth, and overﬂowed the city to that point. Alarm bells ringing,
drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its own beach, the
attack begun.’ Madame Defarge helps to lead it: ‘ “What! We can kill as
well as the men . . . !” And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping
women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.’
This turmoil goes on for years, but by 1792 the instrument of vengeance
the scaffold, counting victims with their stitches. France is peopled with
‘patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades, armed with national
muskets and sabres’, sullen and suspicious, who instinctively curse all
‘aristocrats’. ‘That a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was
no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work.’ By the beginning of 1794,
Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily,
ﬁlled with the condemned. Lovely girls, bright women, brown-haired,
black-haired, and grey; youths, stalwart men and old; gentle born and
peasant born, all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light
from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her
through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty, equality,
fraternity, or death – the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!

And although the French aristocrat Charles Darnay escapes, and his
persecutor Madame Defarge is killed before she can pursue him,

is the guillotine. Madame Defarge and her fellow Furies now knit around

the book concludes with the English lawyer Sydney Carton sacriﬁcing
himself on the scaffold to her vengeance.
These images, intertwined with a powerfully crafted and heart-rending
story, deﬁned the French Revolution for Oscar Wilde’s generation. For
the next, and for the whole twentieth century, they were reinforced by
the lesser talents of Mrs Montague Barstow, who dubiously capitalized
on her birth in remote Hungary to call herself Baroness Orczy. The
Scarlet Pimpernel (1905) and its later sequels chronicled the adventures
of a foppish English knight, Sir Percy Blakeney, who led a double life
rescuing innocent aristocrats from the guillotine by spiriting them, in
various disguises, across the Channel to safety. But gone were the
nuances found in Dickens. While the people of Paris remained ‘a
surging, seething, murmuring crowd, of beings that are human only in

name, for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures,
animated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate’, their
victims, ‘those aristos . . . all of them, men, women and children who
happened to be descendants of the great men who since the Crusades
had made the glory of France’ were objects of pity, and in no way
responsible for the supposed oppression of their ancestors. The whole
episode was pure blood lust, successfully deﬁed only by the efforts of
‘that demmed elusive Pimpernel’ and his intrepid band of secret agents,
all English gentlemen. There is little hint in Orczy, unlike Carlyle or
Dickens, that the old order had earned the fate that had befallen it.
There is simply regret for ‘beautiful Paris, now rendered hideous by
the wailing of the widows, and the cries of the fatherless children’.
The men all wore red caps – in various styles of cleanliness – but all with
the tricolour cockade . . . their faces now invariably wore a look of sly
distrust. Every man nowadays was a spy upon his fellows: the most
innocent word uttered in jest might at any time be brought up as a proof
of aristocratic tendencies, or of treachery against the people. Even the
women went about with a curious look of fear and of hate lurking in their
brown eyes, and all watched . . . and murmured . . . ‘Sacrés aristos!’
8

Twentieth-century parallels
The Scarlet Pimpernel began as a successful play, and was regularly
re-adapted for stage and screen throughout the twentieth century. So
was A Tale of Two Cities. The scope offered by both for costume drama
was too rich for producers to resist for long. But for twentieth-century
audiences seeking to sample revolution there were now more
immediate examples. The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917,
chronicled at once in language that echoed Carlyle by John Reed in Ten
Days that Shook the World (1919), offered a fresh paradigm. It was also
captured by the new and more immediate medium of ﬁlm. Even more
abundantly, so were subsequent upheavals in Germany, China, and
countless other countries experiencing revolution in the later twentieth
century. Figures like Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao have replaced
Robespierre or Danton as quintessential revolutionaries in the popular
imagination. Even the unique horror of the guillotine has been dwarfed
gulag, the mass intimidation of Mao’s cultural revolution, or the killing
ﬁelds of Cambodia. And yet many Russians in 1917 saw themselves,
and indeed were widely seen, as re-enacting the struggles in France
after 1789. Subsequent revolutionaries, if less conscious of the French
precedents, have nevertheless sought legitimacy in doctrines of popular
sovereignty all traceable to claims ﬁrst explicitly made in 1789. Many,
even those like the Nazis who professed to despise traditions now
especially revered by Communism, celebrated their power with rituals
and ceremonies redolent of the great set-piece festivals organized ﬁrst
in France between 1790 and 1794.

The Corsican contribution
And one ﬁgure thrown up by the French Revolution has continued to
be widely recognized – Napoleon. He remains one of the very few
characters in history universally known by his ﬁrst name, and by his
appearance – especially if wearing his hat. He owes this recognition

largely to remarkable achievements as a general, but his military
prowess was built on the opportunities afforded him by the Revolution,
and when he created new regimes in the aftermath of his victories, he
thought it self-evident that they should run themselves on principles
elaborated in France since 1789. Certainly, the nineteenth century was
haunted by the memory of the way that he and the revolutionized
French nation tore the rest of Europe (Great Britain excepted) apart. The
Russians particularly, although they (or at least their climate) defeated
him, were traumatized by the invasion of 1812. Half a century later,
Tolstoy made the struggle against Napoleon the setting for War and
Peace (1865–9). The novel’s characters, from Czar Alexander
downwards, are at the same time impressed and repelled by the
Corsican usurper and what he stands for. For good or ill, he transforms
all their lives. All the inhabitants of continental Europe during
The French Revolution

Napoleon’s lifetime could have claimed as much. Even when he had
gone, many of them found their everyday existence still regulated by
laws which he had introduced. Napoleon claimed, when his
campaigning days were over, that his most enduring glory would not be
that of the battles he had won, but his Civil Code. In reality, the Code
was a revolutionary project which Napoleon merely brought to fruition.
But its impact was substantial enough, and not only in France. A simple,
clear, and uniform set of principles for the holding and transfer of
property, it remained the basis of civil law in much of Germany
throughout the nineteenth century, in Poland until 1946, in Belgium and
Luxembourg until the present day. Its inﬂuence still pervades the legal
systems of Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany. An even greater success
story has been metrication. Elaborated between 1790 and 1799, the
decimal metric system of weights and measures was zealously
promoted under Napoleon. Even in France it was slow to establish its
monopoly, but in the subsequent two centuries it has spread to most of
the world. When the United States succumbs, as sooner or later it surely
will, it will mark the most complete triumph of any of the many trends
and movements that the French Revolution began, its fullest and least
ambiguous living legacy.

DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF
MAN AND OF CITIZENS
By the National Assembly of France
‘THE Representatives of the people of France, formed into a
National Assembly, considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights, are the sole causes of public misfortunes and corruptions of Government, have resolved to set
forth, in a solemn declaration, these natural, imprescriptible,
and unalienable rights: that this declaration being constantly
present to the minds of the members of the body social, they
may be ever kept attentive to their rights and their duties:
that the acts of the legislative and executive powers of GovernThe French Revolution

ment, being capable of being every moment compared
with the end of political institutions, may be more respected: and also, that the future claims of the citizens, being
directed by simple and incontestible principles, may always
tend to the maintenance of the Constitution, and the general
happiness.
‘For these reasons, the National Assembly doth recognize and
declare, in the presence of the Supreme Being, and with the
hope of his blessing and favour, the following sacred rights of
men and of citizens:
I. Men are born, and always continue, free, and equal in respect
of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only
on public utility.
II. The end of all political associations, is, the preservation of the
natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are
liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression.

12

III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can
any individual, or any body of men, be entitled to any authority
which is not expressly derived from it.
IV. Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever
does not injure another. The exercise of the natural rights of
every man, has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the
same rights; and these limits are determinable only by the
law.
V. The law ought to prohibit only actions hurtful to society.
What is not prohibited by the law, should not be hindered; nor
should any one be compelled to that which the law does not
require.

All citizens have a right to concur, either personally, or by
their representatives, in its formation. It should be the same
to all, whether it protects or punishes; and all being equal in
its sight, are equally eligible to all honours, places, and
employments, according to their different abilities, without
any other distinction than that created by their virtues and
talents.
VII. No man should be accused, arrested, or held in conﬁnement, except in cases determined by the law, and according
to the forms which it has prescribed. All who promote, solicit,
execute, or cause to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to
be punished; and every citizen called upon, or apprehended
by virtue of the law, ought immediately to obey, and renders
himself culpable by resistance.

13

VI. The law is an expression of the will of the community.

VIII. The law ought to impose no other penalties but such as are
absolutely and evidently necessary: and no one ought to be
punished, but in virtue of a law promulgated before the
offence, and legally applied.
IX. Every man being presumed innocent till he has been
convicted, whenever his detention becomes indispensible, all
rigour to him, more than is necessary to secure his person,
ought to be provided against by the law.
X. No man ought to be molested on account of his opinions, not
even on account of his religious opinions, provided his avowal
of them does not disturb the public order established by the
The French Revolution

law.
XI. The unrestrained communication of thoughts and opinions
being one of the most precious rights of man, every citizen may
speak, write, and publish freely, provided he is responsible for
the abuse of this liberty in cases determined by law.
XII. A public force being necessary to give security to the rights
of men and of citizens, that force is instituted for the beneﬁt of
the community, and not for the particular beneﬁt of the persons with whom it is entrusted.
XIII. A common contribution being necessary for the support of
the public force, and for defraying the other expences of government, it ought to be divided equally among the members of
the community, according to their abilities.
XIV. Every citizen has a right, either by himself or his representative, to a free voice in determining the necessity of public

14

contributions, the appropriation of them, and their amount,
mode of assessment, and duration.
XV. Every community has a right to demand of all its agents, an
account of their conduct.
XVI. Every community in which a separation of powers and a
security of rights is not provided for, wants a constitution.
XVII. The right to property being inviolable and sacred, no one
ought to be deprived of it, except in cases of evident public
necessity, legally ascertained, and on condition of a previous
just indemnity.’
Thomas Paine’s translation into English from the French incorporated

Human rights
‘The Revolution was a grand thing!’ exclaims Pierre Bezukhov in the ﬁrst
chapter of War and Peace. ‘ “ . . . robbery, murder and regicide”, . . .
interjected an ironical voice. “Those were extremes, no doubt, but they
are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of
man, emancipation from prejudices, and quality of citizenship.”
Certainly this was what the Revolution began with, and on 26 August
1789 the National Assembly promulgated a founding manifesto to guide
its work: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. This was
something entirely new in the history of the world. The English Bill of
Rights of 1689 had only proclaimed the rights of Englishmen. The
United States did not establish its own Bill of Rights until a year after the
French; and whereas the French declaration was meant as a preamble

enshrining basic principles of a constitution, the American Bill was
a series of afterthoughts, amendments to an already-existing
constitution. Its principal architects, despite the precedent of
declarations of rights prefacing a number of individual state
constitutions in the 1770s, did not feel a properly drafted constitution
was in need of what Alexander Hamilton, New York delegate to the
Constitutional Convention, called ‘aphorisms . . . which would sound
much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government’.
A declaration of human rights was a hostage to fortune: but that is
precisely what the French citizens of 1789 intended. Since ‘ignorance,
neglect, or contempt of human rights are the sole causes of public
misfortunes and corruptions of Government’, a statement of the
‘natural, imprescriptible, and unalienable rights . . . constantly present
The French Revolution

to the minds of the members of the body social’ would ensure that ‘they
may be ever kept attentive to their rights and their duties’. It would
offer a yardstick against which all citizens could measure the behaviour
of governments. Nor were these conceived of simply as French rights,
although all French citizens were to enjoy them. Liberty, property,
security, and resistance to oppression; civil equality, the rule of law,
freedom of conscience and expression; the sovereign authority of
nations and the answerability of governments to the citizenry; all these
were declared human rights, and by implication applicable everywhere.
It is true that within six years the French had redrafted this list twice,
extending it and then restricting it. Napoleon abandoned it entirely in
his successive constitutions. But every subsequent constitution-maker
has felt obliged to make a principled decision about whether or not to
incorporate such a declaration; and all those who have done so have
gone back at some point to the prototype of 1789. When in 1948 the
ﬂedgling United Nations decided to adopt a Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the preamble and 14 out of its 30 articles were taken in
substance, and sometimes in very wording, from the Declaration of
1789. Two further articles derived from the more ambitious Declaration
of 1793, and one from the more modest Declaration of Rights and
16

Duties of 1795. The European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in
1953, was also full of the provisions and language of 1789. And, whereas
France itself declined to ratify the European Convention until 1973, by
the time of the bicentenary of the Revolution in 1989, President François
Mitterrand had ordained that it should be celebrated as the Revolution
of the Rights of Man.

A disputed legacy
It was a vain hope. The British, as always, were determined to spoil
France’s party. Their royal family refused to attend any celebration of a
regicide revolution. Margaret Thatcher declared that the rights of man
were a British invention, and gave Mitterrand a lavishly bound copy of A
Tale of Two Cities. A British historian working in America produced a vast
chronicle of the Revolution which argued that its very essence was
violence and slaughter (Citizens, by Simon Schama). It was a bestseller in
laboured in vain. But even within France the celebrations proved bitterly
contentious. Although when the Rights of Man were ﬁrst proclaimed,
the terror lay more than four years into the future, and the guillotine
had not even been invented, few found it easy to look back on the
Revolution as other than a single and consistent episode, for good or ill.
For the left, the terror had been cruel necessity, made inevitable by the
determination of the enemies of liberty and the rights of man to
strangle them at birth. For the right, the Revolution had been violent
from the start in its commitment to destroying respect and reverence
for order and religion. Its logical culmination, some argued, was not
merely terror, but, in the rebellious department of the Vendée,
slaughter amounting to genocide. Many Catholic clergy, meanwhile,
anathematized any celebration of what had brought the ﬁrst attack in
history on religious practice, using language that had scarcely changed
in the course of two centuries. Mitterrand, however, enjoyed it all. The
Revolution, he reﬂected with characteristic malice, ‘is still feared, which
inclines me rather to rejoice’.

Chapter 2
Why it happened

We can scarcely discuss why anything happens until we have a basic
idea of what it is. Almost any attempt to deﬁne the French Revolution
too closely, however, will be tendentious, and exclude many of its
complexities. Yet what it most certainly was not, was a single event.
It was a series of developments, bewildering to most contemporaries,
which stretched over a number of years. It was a sustained period of
uncertainty, disorder, and conﬂict, reverberating far beyond the borders
of France. It began between 1787 and 1789.

Financial overstretch
The crisis was triggered by King Louis XVI’s attempts to avoid
bankruptcy. Over the eighteenth century, France had fought three
great wars on a worldwide scale. Accustomed by the pride, ambition,
and achievements of Louis XIV (1643–1715) to regarding herself as the
greatest European power, France found her pretensions challenged
over the three generations following the great king’s death by the rise
of new powers – Russia, Prussia, and above all Great Britain. Rivalry
with the British was fought out on the oceans of the world. At stake
was dominance of the sources and supply of the tropical and oriental
luxuries for which Europe was developing an insatiable appetite.
Footholds in India, staging posts to China, fur-rich Canadian forests,
tropical islands where sugar and coffee could be produced, access to
19

supplies of slaves to work them: these were the prizes for which the
British and French fought almost uninterruptedly throughout the
1740s and 1750s. But France also had land frontiers and traditional
continental interests to defend, and in the mid-century wars Louis XV
(1715–74) found his forces overextended on both land and sea. In the
Seven Years War (1756–63) the results were disastrous. Despite
alliances with Russia and even the traditional enemy Austria, his armies
were humiliated by the upstart Prussians. At sea, the British destroyed
both the Atlantic and Mediterranean ﬂeets, drove French power out of
India and North America, and all but strangled the trade of the French
Caribbean. At the peace of Paris (1763), France made no European
gains and lost Canada and most of her establishments in India. Not
only was the defeat comprehensive and shameful, the war also left the
kingdom burdened with a colossal debt which there was little prospect
The French Revolution

of diminishing, much less paying off. Servicing it absorbed 60 per cent
of tax revenues. And yet almost at once a fresh naval build-up began,
and when in the 1770s the colonists of British North America declared
their independence, France saw the opportunity for revenge on the
tyrant of the seas. The prospect of destroying the British Empire, and
the commercial rewards that would result, seemed well worth a
renewed effort, and in 1778 Louis XVI went to war to protect the
ﬂedgling United States. This time it was a spectacular success. While
continental Europe remained at peace, France led a coalition against
the isolated British which broke their control of the Atlantic long
enough to ship a French army to America. When British forces
surrendered at Yorktown in 1781, the victory was more French than
American.
But France made no territorial gains when peace was signed in 1783, and
the independent Americans gave no sign of abandoning their traditional
British trading links. And meanwhile the war had been paid for largely
by new loans rather than signiﬁcant increases in taxation. In ﬁnancial
terms it ended not a moment too soon; but massive borrowing now
continued into peacetime. By 1786 a foreseeable decline in tax revenues
20

and the scheduled repayment of short-term war loans brought a
ﬁnancial crisis.
It was not that France lacked the resources to survive as a great power.
Over the next generation the French would dominate the European
continent more completely than they had ever done. It was rather that
many of these resources were locked up by the system of government,
the organization of society, and the culture of what revolutionaries
would soon be calling the ancien régime, the old or former order. It took
the Revolution to release them.

The ancien régime: government
In political terms pre-revolutionary France was an absolute monarchy.
The king shared his power with nobody, and was answerable for its
were his private domain; and in all things he was sovereign in the sense
that his decisions were ﬁnal. On the other hand, no king was, or sought
to be, a completely free agent. Even Louis XIV was careful to take advice
on all important decisions, and men born to be king (for queens regnant
were prohibited by French law) were carefully taught that counsel was
of the essence of their sovereign authority. Louis XVI believed this
implicitly; but unlike his grandfather Louis XV (his own father had died
before inheriting the throne) he did not invariably do what a majority of
his ministers recommended. He particularly thought he understood
ﬁnance – a fateful delusion as it proved.
Nor was the king unfettered in his choice of advisers. Although he could
sack them without explanation, his practical choice was limited to
career administrators, magistrates, and courtiers. They, in turn, could
only be brought to his notice by the intrigues of other ministers and
familiars of both sexes drawn from the ranks or clienteles of the few
hundred families rich enough to live in the gilded splendour of the
Court. Imprisoned in scarcely changing routines of etiquette established

in the previous century by Louis XIV, his two successors passed their
lives peripatetically, following the hunting around forest palaces outside
Paris – Fontainebleau, Compiègne, and of course Versailles, that
spectacular seat of power imitated by rulers throughout Europe. When
they visited the capital, it was brieﬂy. Louis XIV had established this
royal lifestyle deliberately to distance himself from a turbulent and
volatile city whose people had deﬁed royal authority during his minority
in the uprising of the Fronde (1648–53). For their part, the Parisians
remained suspicious and contemptuous of the Court. In 1789 many still
remembered how, when celebrations in the capital to mark the future
Louis XVI’s marriage to the Austrian princess Marie-Antoinette in 1770
had led to a stampede in which 132 people were trampled to death,
the festivities at Versailles had gone on regardless. Symbolizing the
ill-starred alliance with the old enemy, the frivolous Marie-Antoinette
The French Revolution

never achieved popularity, even when, in 1781, she belatedly bore
Louis XVI an heir. Her extravagance was so proverbial that even when
rumours of it were disproved (as with her supposed secret purchase of
a sumptuous diamond necklace in 1786) they were still believed.
Unlike his raddled old grandfather, Louis XVI was a chaste family man
who never took a mistress. But this threw the public spotlight onto his
unpopular wife even more glaringly.
The king’s absolute authority over the country at large was embodied
in a handful of omnicompetent executive agents, the intendants.
One of these was assigned to each of 36 generalities into which Louis
XVI’s kingdom was divided. The king thought them the showcase
of his government, and there was no doubt about their high level
of professionalism. But they were increasingly unpopular for their
authoritarian ways, and their shortcomings and mistakes were
mercilessly denounced by bodies whose authority they had largely
supplanted since the seventeenth century. Taxation in some large
provinces, for instance, still required the consent of estates –
representative, though seldom elected, assemblies with no ultimate
powers to resist, but whose semblance of independence enabled them
22

to borrow relatively cheaply on the king’s behalf. Above all, the ﬁscal
and administrative work of the intendants was constantly impeded by
the courts of law, most of which had administrative as well as judicial
functions. At the summit of the judicial hierarchy sat the 13 parlements,
supreme or ‘sovereign’ courts of appeal where registration was
required for all important royal legislation before it became operative.
Before registering, the parlements had the power to send the king
remonstrances pointing out ﬂaws or drawbacks in the new laws.
Increasingly over the eighteenth century, remonstrances were printed
and published, exposing the principles of monarchical government to
public debate in a country where overt political discussion was deemed
none of the subject’s business. In the end, the king could override
such protests, but the procedure, which involved the monarch or
his representative coming to a court in person and supervising the
transcription of contested measures into the judicial registers, was
as much as the king’s authority.
As in every aspect of the ancien régime, the judicial and institutional
map of France had no uniformity. Some of the parlements presided over
small enclaves, others over extensive provinces. The jurisdiction of the
parlement of Paris covered a third of the kingdom. But all of the 1250
members of these courts owned the ofﬁces they occupied, as a result
of the practice of venality. Since the sixteenth century kings had
systematically sold public ofﬁces, along with hereditary tenure or
free disposal, as a way of borrowing for little outlay. By the eighteenth
century there were perhaps 70,000 venal ofﬁces stretching far
beyond the judiciary, but the prestigious core of the system was the
3200-strong nobility of the robe, whose judicial ofﬁces conferred
ennoblement. Most prestigious among them were the magistrates
of the parlements, and because dismissing them would have
entailed reimbursing the value of their ofﬁces, they enjoyed virtually
unchallengeable tenure. The king could bully them by shows of force,
but without the money to buy them out, he could not dispossess them.
23

Why it happened

laborious and spectacular. It underlined the magistrates’ recalcitrance

Accordingly, throughout the eighteenth century they were able to keep
up a growing volume of criticism and obstruction against the crown’s
religious and ﬁnancial policies. Only in 1771 did Louis XV’s ministers feel
able to promise any compensation for suppressed ofﬁces, and then the
parlements were ruthlessly remodelled and muzzled. An opportunity
was created for unobstructed reform, but Maupeou, the chancellor
responsible, had no serious reforming intentions, and no advantage was
taken. Meanwhile his attack on the parlements, which had increasingly
come to be seen as the voice of the king’s unrepresented subjects,
proved hugely unpopular. Anxious to begin his reign in an atmosphere
of conﬁdence and popularity, the young Louis XVI was persuaded to
dismiss Maupeou and restore them.
In the short run it worked. Although some provincial parlements
The French Revolution

remained fractious, and obstructed their local intendant more than
ever, the crucially important parlement of Paris proved fairly pliable for
the best part of a dozen years. It was, however, at the cost of the king
attempting nothing too radical. Innovation was seen, and accepted
even by most ministers, as dangerous. ‘Any system’, declared the
parlement in remonstrances of 1776 against the replacement of forced
labour on the roads with a tax,
tending under the guise of humanity and benevolence to establish an
equality of duties between men, and to destroy those distinctions
necessary in a well-ordered monarchy, would soon lead to disorder . . .
The result would be the overthrow of civil society, the harmony of which
is maintained only by that hierarchy of powers, authorities, preeminences and distinctions which keeps each man in his place and keeps
all Estates from confusion. This social order is not only essential to the
practice of every sound government: it has its origin in divine law. The
inﬁnite and immutable wisdom in the plan of the universe established an
unequal distribution of strength and character, necessarily resulting in
inequality in the conditions of men within the civil order . . . These
institutions were not formed by chance, and time cannot change them.
24

To abolish them, the whole French constitution would have to be
overturned.

The ancien régime: society
Yet it was hard to see how a French king could keep up his international
pretensions without some modiﬁcation in his subjects’ time-honoured
privileges and inequalities. Nowhere was the kingdom’s lack of
uniformity more glaring than in the structure of privilege and
exemption which gave each and every institution, group, or area a
status not quite like any other. The kingdom had been built up over
many centuries by a gradual and often haphazard process of conquest
and dynastic accumulation, and successive kings had won the
obedience of their new subjects more by conﬁrming their distinct
institutions than by imposing a preferred pattern of their own. Ever
the practice of selling privileges and exemptions (usually but not always
as part of the sale of ofﬁces) as a roundabout way of borrowing. In
earlier times it was easier to do than trying to force the rich to pay taxes.
The most powerful groups in society, in any case, had elaborated
persuasive rationales for exemption. The clergy, a vast corporation
drawing revenues from a tenth of the kingdom’s land, and creaming off,
in the form of tithes, a notional tenth of the yield of the rest, paid no
direct taxes on the grounds that it performed its service to society by
praying and interceding with God. The nobility, the social elite which
owned over a quarter of the land, levied feudal dues over much of the
rest, and steadily sucked most of the newly rich into its ranks via
ennobling ofﬁces, resisted the payment of direct taxes as well. Nobles,
the argument went, served the kingdom with their blood, by ﬁghting to
defend it. Many did (though as ofﬁcers only), but many more never
drew the swords they wore to demonstrate their status. In any case
these ancient arguments failed to keep the nobility exempt from new
direct taxes introduced in and after 1695. Nevertheless, in most
provinces, nobles continued to escape the oldest basic direct tax, the
25

Why it happened

since the sixteenth century these confusions had been compounded by

taille, not to mention forced labour on the roads. It was easy enough for
rich commoners to buy themselves exemption as well, even if an
ennobling ofﬁce was beyond their means; simply moving to another
town or province might be enough to secure real ﬁscal advantages. The
burden of taxation, in other words, fell disproportionately on those least
able to pay. To one extent or another, the rich were able to avoid it. It
was the boast of the king’s richest subject, his cousin the Duke
d’Orléans, that he paid what he liked.
In real terms the total tax burden borne by the French had fallen over
the eighteenth century. Yet whatever they paid they all considered
themselves over-taxed. That was one reason why the resistance of
the parlements, even though their magistrates were all nobles and
represented nobody but themselves, was so popular. Even they
The French Revolution

recognized, however, that some emergencies necessitated higher taxes,
and they acquiesced in a new levy of a twentieth on income from real
estate in 1749. They even agreed to its doubling in 1756 and tripling in
1760. But the third twentieth lapsed when the Seven Years War ended,
and meanwhile all sorts of provincial and institutional abatements had
been negotiated, notably with the clergy and provinces retaining
estates. Once assessments were established, the parlements always
resisted their revision, even though this was an age of steady inﬂation.
Their scepticism about the need for ﬁscal reform was only conﬁrmed in
the late 1770s when the American war was launched and sustained for
four years without any substantial new taxation. This was the work of
the Genevan banker Jacques Necker, who claimed to have achieved the
incredible feat by ‘economies’ at the expense of courtiers and venal
government ﬁnanciers, two groups traditionally suspected of milking
the public purse. But the purpose of such ostentatious savings was not
to pay directly for the war, but to boost French credit in the
international money market so as to sustain borrowing. Necker
trumpeted his success in 1781 by publishing the ﬁrst ever public
statement of the royal accounts, the Compte rendu au roi. It showed the
king’s ‘ordinary’ accounts in modest surplus. It was what the public
26

wanted to hear, and few cared that the massive ‘extraordinary’
expenditure, covered by loans raised on the credit of the ordinary
surplus, went unmentioned. The longer term consequence was to
undermine all attempts by Necker’s successors to improve the
kingdom’s tax yield, especially once the war was over. If all had been
well in 1781, people later asked, what had gone wrong since, and who
was responsible?
Necker had been brought in more as a credit consultant than as a
minister. As a foreign-born Protestant, in fact, he was legally ineligible
for public ofﬁce in a kingdom where Protestantism had not been
recognized since 1685. But he soon learned that he could not impose
ﬁnancial discipline on ministers without the regular direct access to
the king which their ofﬁce gave them. When he attempted to use his
popularity to force the king to admit him to his innermost counsels,
unprecedented: one did not resign on the king of France. Nor had
previous ex-ministers behaved as Necker now did, continuing to publish
on ﬁnancial affairs and orchestrating public criticism of the policies of
his successors. What this outsider to the habits of absolute monarchy
had grasped was that, in political as much as in ﬁnancial affairs, public
opinion, or what governments took it to be, was of ever-increasing
importance; and that without public conﬁdence even, and perhaps
especially, the most absolute ruler could achieve very little.

Public opinion
The constraints were obvious in innumerable ways. If, for instance, the
whole ﬁnancial history of the monarchy between 1720 and 1788 was a
struggle to avoid bankruptcy, that was because renouncing debts,
which earlier kings had done almost routinely, was no longer accepted
as a legitimate option. Thousands had been ruined by a great ﬁnancial
crash in 1720, when another Protestant outsider, the Scotsman John
Law, had attempted to liquidate the ﬁnancial legacy of Louis XIV’s wars
27

Why it happened

however, Necker was rebuffed, and resigned. The gesture was

by absorbing the accumulated debt into the capital of a commercial
‘Royal Bank’. The collapse of this experiment also produced an enduring
mistrust of banks and paper money despite all they had done in Holland
or Great Britain to sustain an unprecedented war effort against France.
For subsequent generations, any expedient which stirred such painful
memories was generally regarded as unthinkable.
Kings who renounced their debts, or paid them in precarious paper
rather than clinking coinage, were seen as conjuring irresponsibly with
their subjects’ property, behaving arbitrarily; whereas in French legal
tradition royal authority was expected to observe the law, proceed by
advice, and respect the rights and privileges of those whom God had
entrusted to its care and protection. In the eighteenth century these
expectations were reinforced by the widespread conviction that since
The French Revolution

nature herself (as Isaac Newton had shown) worked by invariable laws
and not divine caprice, human affairs should also be conducted so far
as was possible according to ﬁxed and regular principles, rooted in
rationality, in which the scope for arbitrariness was reduced to a
minimum. Anything else, when a single individual governed, was
despotism; which the most inﬂuential political writer of the century,
Montesquieu had taught his compatriots to regard as the worst of all
governments, where no law protected the subject from the ruler’s
whims. So that when a series of draconian debt consolidations in 1770,
which many saw as a partial bankruptcy, was followed by Maupeou’s
attack on the parlements, despotism appeared to have struck.
Traditional intermediary buffers between ruler and subject had been
swept aside. And despite Louis XVI’s restoration of the old parlements
upon his succession, instinctive conﬁdence in the traditional
constitutional structure could never be fully revived.
Yet although the public saw no need for either higher taxes or
bankruptcy, only a government strong and conﬁdent enough to
attempt either was likely to be able to carry other reforms that had
widespread support. The judiciary, for example, was perceived to be
28

overstaffed, underemployed, and its procedures slow, expensive, and
unreliable. A series of miscarriages of criminal justice exposed the
cruelties and caprices of a system where magistrates were recruited by
heredity or purchase rather than rational tests of competence. The
labyrinthine complexities of the law, where attempts at codiﬁcation had
petered out in the 1670s, were sustained by innumerable local and
provincial customs and privileges, many of them repeatedly conﬁrmed
in return for cash payments over the centuries. To reform any of this
without compensating the losers would be widely seen as a breach of
public faith, bankruptcy in disguise; but there was no prospect of ever
ﬁnding the money to achieve it otherwise.
More thoughtful observers believed there were ways to square some
circles. If economic productivity could be improved, ﬁscal beneﬁts
would be almost automatic. The Physiocrats or Economists (the ﬁrst
agriculture, and that the land would produce more if natural laws were
unimpeded by artiﬁcial human constraints. That implied tax reform –
the abolition of burdensome charges like feudal dues in cash or kind, or
tithes. It also meant commercial liberalization – the removal of controls
on prices and free exchange, particularly in the grain trade. In
comparison with agriculture, industry and commerce were held by
these thinkers to be less important, and not generators of true wealth:
but here too natural activity was impeded by over-regulation, the
constraints imposed by trade guilds, and commercial monopolies.
Administrators at every level found such reforming ideas increasingly
attractive after mid-century; but as soon as they began to experiment
with them they met with endless difﬁculties. Governments could not
contemplate even the temporary loss of revenue, not to mention likely
opposition from courts, estates, and various corporate bodies, which
introducing a single tax would entail. Similarly with feudal dues: these
were property rights, which could not be abolished equitably without
compensation. A book advocating their suppression was publicly
burned by order of the Paris parlement in 1776. As to the tithe, it was the

people to use this name) argued that all true wealth derived from

main source of income of the parish clergy. Where would a substitute
come from? The merest hint of commercial and industrial deregulation,
meanwhile, was vigorously opposed by well-organized lobbies of
merchants, chambers of commerce, and guild masters. Only in 1786 was
trade with overseas colonies made completely free and open, and an
attempt to abolish the monopolies of Parisian trade guilds ten years
earlier was abandoned after only a few months of chaos. The only
people, in fact, who could be subjected to the full force of Physiocratic
policies were those too weak to resist: the king’s poorest subjects. They
bore the brunt of experiments from the 1760s onwards to deregulate
the grain trade. The idea was to let prices rise to a ‘natural’ level. High
prices, so the theory went, would encourage growers to increase
production, and the end result would be ‘abundance’. In the short
term, however, higher grain prices meant dearer bread, especially
The French Revolution

when harvests were poor. The ﬁrst experiments with deregulation,
between 1763 and 1775, coincided with a series of such shortfalls; and
as magistrates and local authorities had warned from the start, public
order broke down as prices shot up and markets were bare. When
ministers made agreements with contractors to guarantee emergency
supplies, they were accused of a ‘famine pact’ to starve the people. In
the weeks before Louis XVI’s coronation in May 1775, popular goodwill
was squandered by renewed deregulation and severe repression of the
‘ﬂour war’ grain riots which followed. And although Necker, snifﬁng
popularity as always, kept the trade ﬁrmly under control, his successors
resumed tinkering. When, in 1788, the harvest failed completely, free
export in previous years had denuded the kingdom of stocks. And the
conﬁdence of ordinary people that the king would protect them from
starvation had been completely eroded by a generation of economic
experiments at their expense.
Nor did they any longer expect much comfort from God’s servants in the
Church. While there was plenty of respect for underpaid parish priests
and the selﬂess nuns who staffed hospitals and poorhouses, there was
widespread disgust at the grotesque maldistribution of the Church’s
30

wealth, and the determination with which its richer beneﬁciaries
defended their privileges. In mid-century the hierarchy had squandered
much popular respect by zealous persecution of dissident priests who
questioned authority in the Church in the name of Jansenism, an
austere set of beliefs condemned as heretical by the papal bull
Unigenitus of 1713. Jansenists were protected by sympathizers in the
parlement of Paris, and in the 1740s and 1750s a series of lawsuits
against priests refusing the last rites to dying Jansenists stirred up
widespread fury against the hierarchy. When in 1757 Louis XV was
(harmlessly) stabbed, his half-crazed assailant seemed to have acted out
of vague sympathy for Jansenist tribulations. And Jansenism appeared
to triumph in the 1760s when its oldest and most inveterate enemies,
the Jesuits, found themselves involved in a case before the parlement.
The magistrates used it as a pretext to expel them from the court’s
jurisdiction. Other parlements followed the lead, and a divided
which had educated most of the social elite for three centuries caused
enormous educational upheaval. With the closure of their 106 colleges,
something like a national curriculum was dissolved, and a generation of
educational debate and experiment began. Almost at the same
moment the establishment of a commission to review and consolidate
failing monasteries suggested that even wider reform in the Church
might be possible.
Educated critics had certainly been calling for it ever since the 1720s,
when the scientiﬁc and humanistic development of the previous century
began to crystallize into the utilitarian movement of criticism that came
to be known as the Enlightenment. For the self-styled ‘philosophers’
who set out to popularize enlightened values, the established Church
was the root of most of the evils in society. While the benevolent
message of the Gospel was never disputed, clerics down the ages were
deemed to have overlaid it with a mass of superstition and irrationality
which they perpetuated through their inﬂuence in the state and control
of the educational system. Happy to promote cruelty and intolerance,

Why it happened

government acquiesced. The expulsion from the kingdom of a society

they had amassed disproportionate riches to support the idleness of
unproductive monks and spendthrift chapters and prelates. Even the
social services provided by the Church, such as poor relief and hospital
care, were irrationally funded and inefﬁciently organized. These charges
were pressed home with innuendo and ridicule, for which the midcentury quarrels within the Church provided plenty of material. The
Church’s response was to call for ever more vigorous and vigilant
censorship, while attempting to reduce its own vulnerability by internal
reforms such as the action on redundant monasteries. But neither
approach restored conﬁdence in an institution whose basic inertia,
inﬂexibility, and self-satisfaction had alienated sympathy, in different
ways, at every level of society.
In one sense, the Church was a victim of its own success. Nothing had
The French Revolution

done more over the century than the efforts of dedicated clerical
teachers to increase levels of literacy from around a ﬁfth of the
population to nearer a third. More readers produced a rising demand for
printed materials of all kinds. Book production soared; so did that of
more ephemeral material like chapbooks, legal briefs sold for public
consumption, and newspapers. By Louis XVI’s time, Paris had a daily
paper and most provincial towns had weeklies. It is true that they were
mainly advertising sheets, and when they printed news it was largely
without comment. But serious interest in public affairs could be
gratiﬁed by a ﬂourishing French-language press published abroad; and
the cost of regular reading could be spread by joining one of the rapidly
proliferating literary or reading societies whose libraries subscribed to
all the major periodicals. Another indication of expanding demand for
the printed word was the growth in the number of government censors
to whom all substantial writings for the public had to be submitted; and
the increasing amount of time and energy devoted by customs ofﬁcials
to blocking imports of subversive pornographic, blasphemous, or, as it
was increasingly called, ‘philosophical’ literature. After a period in midcentury when ministers despaired of stemming the ﬂood, and turned a
blind eye to most of it, under Louis XVI the government redoubled its
32

efforts to control what reached the reading public. But the market was
too strong, and as much effort was soon being devoted to inﬂuencing
what was reported and discussed as to preventing its appearance. Louis
XIV had told his subjects what to do, and what to think. Under Louis XVI,
it was recognized that they had to be persuaded.
The virtues of active cooperation between kings and their subjects had
long been displayed across the Channel. Ever since the 1720s writers like
Montesquieu and Voltaire had extolled the enabling freedoms of British
liberty, toleration, and parliamentary government. British success in
mid-century wars had shown that the system, still suspect to many for
its dangerous volatility, was also formidably efﬁcient. Some of the gloss
was taken from the image of Great Britain when her colonies rebelled,
and Anglomania was partially eclipsed by enthusiasm for all things
American. But liberty and political representation were at the heart of
rebels who had proclaimed no taxation without representation, his
subjects could scarcely help reﬂecting on why this principle was not
deemed appropriate in France. In the handful of provinces with estates,
of course, it was; but that made the situation elsewhere seem even
more anomalous. As ﬁscal pressures increased, certain magistrates in
the 1760s began to call for lost estates to be restored. When Maupeou
attacked the parlements in 1771, some went further and called for a
meeting of the nearest French equivalent to the British parliament, the
medieval Estates-General, last convened in 1614. Others, with the
comfortable ambiguities of absolute monarchy now exposed as empty,
began to think of more rationally designed representative institutions
that would visibly involve taxpayers in administration. Nor were
ministers necessarily opposed to a principle which might sideline the
parlements and their inﬂuence. Necker even began a programme of
introducing ‘provincial administrations’, nominated assemblies of local
landowners who would share the functions of intendants. Only two
were established before his resignation, but they did not disappear
with him. Slowly, hesitantly, with many misgivings but aware that

the Anglo-American quarrel; and when Louis XVI allied with republican

institutional paralysis was the only alternative, the monarchy was
becoming less absolute under Louis XVI. The king and his ministers
increasingly recognized that France must be governed with the effective
consent and cooperation of the crown’s most prominent and educated
subjects.

The ‘Pre-Revolution’
So the crisis of 1787 was not just ﬁnancial. Calonne, the ﬁnance minister
appointed in 1783 to manage a return to peacetime conditions, began
with lavish expenditures in the hope of sustaining conﬁdence. The
borrowing which this required achieved just the reverse. As attempts to
ﬂoat new loans ran into increasing resistance in the Paris parlement,
Calonne turned his thoughts to more radical solutions. On 20 August
The French Revolution

1786 he presented the king with a comprehensive plan of reform,
later described by the courtier bishop Talleyrand as ‘more or less the
result of all that good minds have been thinking for several years’. The
king, after considering it carefully, accepted it with genuine
enthusiasm.
The plan was threefold. First came ﬁscal reform, in the guise of a new,
uniform land tax, with no exemptions, to be levied in kind. This, and
other less important innovations, were to be overseen throughout the
kingdom by provincial assemblies elected by all prominent landowners.
Representative government was to be universalized – though not
centralized in a national assembly. Secondly, the ﬁscal yield of the
reforms was to be boosted by a programme of economic stimulation on
Physiocratic lines: abolition of internal customs barriers, of forced
labour on the roads, and of controls over the grain trade. In 1786, a
commercial agreement with Great Britain had already opened French
markets to British manufacturers in exchange for agricultural products.
None of these measures, however, could be expected to yield
immediate beneﬁts. More borrowing would be required until the effects
were felt. A major new boost in conﬁdence was therefore required to
34

encourage lenders. Calonne hoped to achieve this by having his plans
endorsed by a handpicked Assembly of Notables, people (as he put
it) ‘of weight, worthy of the public’s conﬁdence and such that
their approbation would powerfully inﬂuence general opinion’. He
considered convoking the Estates-General, but thought them likely
to be uncontrollable. Instead he nominated 144 princes, prelates,
noblemen, and magistrates, before whom he laid his proposals in
February 1787.
It was a political disaster. Few of the Notables accepted Calonne’s
version of the crisis confronting the state. Even those who did tended to
hold him responsible, and therefore not the right person to resolve it.
An attempt by Calonne to appeal over his critics’ heads to the wider
public, by depicting them as mere selﬁsh defenders of their own
privileges, backﬁred; and the king was forced to dismiss him. An
an archbishop who had used the Notables as a ladder to power. It
got nowhere when Louis XVI refused the Notables’ proposal for a
permanent commission of auditors to vet the royal accounts. By now, in
fact, growing numbers in the assembly were declaring themselves
incompetent to sanction reform of any sort. That, they declared,
required nothing less than the Estates-General.
Experience with the Notables only made this seem more dangerous and
unpredictable than ever, and on 25 May the assembly was dissolved. An
attempt was now made to push the reforms through the parlements,
but they too claimed incompetence. As crowds came onto the streets
to cheer for the Estates-General, the Parisian magistrates were sent into
exile. The wider signiﬁcance of the crisis was underlined meanwhile in
the Dutch Republic, which was overrun by a Prussian invasion in midSeptember. Louis XVI had threatened to intervene if Dutch territory was
violated; but, with old taxation running out and new unauthorized,
Brienne advised him that he could not afford to. It was the end of the
Bourbon monarchy as a military power; an admission that, even close
35

Why it happened

amended version of his plan was then brought forward by Brienne,

to its own frontiers, it could no longer pay for its international
pretensions.
Within a year its domestic political authority had also evaporated.
Attempts to engineer a consensual reform plan with the Paris parlement
collapsed amid suspicious recriminations, and for six months the
sovereign courts refused to transact business. In May 1788, a Maupeoulike attempt was made to remodel them and reduce their powers. To
win public support a wide range of legal and institutional reforms were
simultaneously announced, but they were ignored in the public uproar
that now swept the country. Even a promise to convoke the EstatesGeneral once the reforms had taken effect was greeted with contempt.
And when, at the beginning of August, the crown’s usual sources of
short-term credit refused to lend more, the fate of Brienne’s ministry
The French Revolution

was sealed. On 16 August, payments from the treasury were suspended.
It was the bankruptcy which successive ministries had spent 30 years
trying to avoid. Brienne resigned, recommending the recall of Necker.
The ﬁrst thing the Genevan miracle-worker did on his triumphant return
to ofﬁce was to proclaim that the Estates-General would meet in 1789.
The convocation of a national representative assembly meant the end of
absolute monarchy. It had ﬁnally succumbed to institutional and
cultural paralysis. Its plans for reform fell with it. Nobody knew what the
Estates-General would do, or even how it would be made up or chosen.
There was a complete vacuum of power. The French Revolution was the
process by which this vacuum was ﬁlled.

36

Chapter 3
How it happened

A month before monarchical authority collapsed into bankruptcy, a
colossal hailstorm swept across northern France and destroyed most
of the ripening harvest. With reserves already low after Calonne had
authorized free export of grain in 1787, the inevitable result was that
the months before the harvest of 1789 would bring severe economic
difﬁculties. Bread prices would rise, and as consumers spent more
of their incomes on food, demand for other goods would fall.
Manufactures, hit by cheaper British competition under the
commercial treaty of 1786, were already slumping; and there were
widespread layoffs at the very time when bread prices began to soar.
On top of all this came an unusually cold winter, when rivers froze,
immobilizing mills and bulk transport and producing widespread
ﬂooding when a thaw ﬁnally came. So the political storm that was about
to break would take place against a background of economic crisis, and
would be profoundly affected by it.

Electoral politics
Necker moved quickly on returning to ofﬁce to reimpose controls on
the grain trade. It was too late, but the gesture only added to his
phenomenal popularity. He needed it all to deal with other problems.
The most pressing was the form to be taken by the Estates-General. One
of Brienne’s last acts had been to declare that the king had no ﬁxed view
37

on the question. To the parlement of Paris this seemed to imply a desire
to rig the assembly in advance; and to prevent any such move the
magistrates declared on 25 September that the Estates-General should
be constituted in the same way as when they had last met, according to
the forms of 1614. Well-informed observers realized at once that this
was a recipe for prolonging the institutional paralysis which had
brought down absolute monarchy. In 1614, the Estates-General had sat
in three separate orders, representing clergy, nobility, and the third
estate – meaning everybody else. They had voted by order, so any two
could outvote a third. Such a distribution of powers and representation
no longer reﬂected the realities of education, wealth, and property as
they had developed over the eighteenth century; and a thoughtful
group of Parisians, mostly noblemen, set out in a so-called ‘committee
of thirty’ to arouse public opinion against it. They ﬂooded the excited
The French Revolution

country with pamphlets, and their efforts were only lent strength when
a reconvened Assembly of Notables rejected Necker’s urgings and
rallied behind the forms of 1614. The Notables’ caution looked, or was
made to look, like a bid for power by the old ‘privileged orders’ at the
expense of the vast majority of the nation. For the ﬁrst time since
the beginning of the crisis in 1787, the politics of social antagonism
began to dominate public debate. ‘What is the Third Estate?’ asked the
title of the most celebrated pamphlet of that winter, by the renegade
clergyman Sieyès, ‘Everything. What has it been until now in the public
order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something.’ Anyone laying
claim to any sort of privilege, Sieyès went on to argue, excluded
themselves by that very fact from the national community. Privileges
were a cancer.
By December the clamour against the forms of 1614 was so well
established that Necker felt emboldened to act. He decreed that, in
recognition of their weight in the nation, the number of third-estate
deputies would be doubled. It was obvious that this meant little if
voting was still to be by order rather than by head, but Necker believed
that the clergy and nobility could be induced to renounce the privilege
38

for themselves once the Estates-General met. He relied on general
dissatisfaction with the half-measure of doubling the third to dominate
the elections of the spring of 1789 to such a degree that resistance to
uniting the orders would become unthinkable. Vote by head was indeed
one of the central preoccupations of the electoral assemblies; but since
they too were separate, with each order electing its own deputies, the
effect was to polarize matters still further. In the face of tumultuous
popular support for third-estate aspirations, clerical and noble electors
tended to see their privileges as an essential safeguard of their identity;
and most of those they elected to represent them were intransigents.
Opinion was crystallized further on all sides by the process of drafting
cahiers (grievance lists which were also part of the forms of 1614) to
guide the deputies chosen. Now emerged questions not only of how the
estates were to be constituted, but of what they were actually to do. An
amazing range of grievances and aspirations were articulated in what
changes seemed possible that only a few months earlier had been the
stuff of dreams; and the tone of the cahiers made clear that many
electors actually expected them to happen through the agency of the
Estates-General.

National sovereignty
But when the Estates-General met at Versailles on 5 May they proved a
massive disappointment. Necker opened proceedings with a boring
speech, and from the start the third-estate deputies made clear that
they would transact no business as a separate order. Their calls to the
nobility and clergy to unite with them, however, fell on deaf ears. Even
the small number of noble deputies who favoured deliberation and
voting in common refused to break ranks. The stalemate continued for
six weeks, during which bread prices continued to rise, public order
began to break down in many districts, and the widespread hopes of the
spring began to turn sour. Eventually, on 10 June, Sieyès proposed that
the third estate ‘cut the cable’ and begin proceedings unilaterally. After
39

How it happened

amounted to the ﬁrst public opinion poll of modern times. Suddenly

an overwhelming vote in favour, they invited the other orders to verify
credentials in common, and three days later a handful of parish priests
broke the solidarity of the privileged orders to answer the invitation.
Other clergy trickled in over the next few days, and a body that was no
longer just representative of the third estate recognized that it now
needed a new name. Once again at Sieyès’ instigation, on 17 June it
chose an obvious but uncompromising title: the National Assembly.
Immediately afterwards it decreed the cancellation and then reauthorization of all taxes. The implication was clear. This assembly had
seized sovereign power in the name of the French Nation.
It was the founding act of the French Revolution. If the Nation was
sovereign, the king no longer was. Louis XVI, shaking off the grief which
had paralysed him since the death of his elder son a few days before,
The French Revolution

now declared that he would hold a Royal Session to promulgate a
programme of his own. Locked out of its usual meeting place by
preparations for this, the suspicious self-proclaimed National Assembly
convened on 20 June in an indoor tennis court and took an emotional
oath never to separate until they had given France a constitution. The
ﬁrst test of the deputies’ resolution came three days later at the Royal
Session when the king, after announcing a number of concessions,
quashed all the claims made between 10 and 17 June, and instructed the
orders to reconvene separately. They refused; and, ﬂustered by news
that Necker had resigned, the king let them stay. By now Versailles was
ﬁlled daily with restive crowds from Paris. Aware that they could no
longer rely on support from the throne, noble and clerical separatists
found their solidarity crumbling. Soon they were joining the National
Assembly in droves, and on 27 June the king formally ordered the last
diehards to do so. Necker withdrew his resignation. The royal surrender
seemed complete.
Unknown to Necker, however, and perhaps at ﬁrst to the king himself,
ministerial orders had been issued on 26 June to certain regiments
to converge on Versailles. More were ordered up in the weeks that

followed, and by early July the nervous Assembly was importuning the
king to withdraw the troops. He replied, plausibly enough, that their
presence was necessary to secure public order; but when on 12 July
Necker was dismissed more sinister suspicions seemed borne out. The
20,000 soldiers now encamped around the Île de France appeared
poised to overawe the capital while action was taken to subdue the
Assembly. On hearing the news about Necker, Paris exploded with a
mixture of fear and indignation. Tentative moves by German mercenary
troops to disperse crowds only made things worse, and members of the
permanent Paris garrison of French Guards began to desert. Soon bands
of hungry insurgents were ransacking strongpoints in the city for arms,
powder, and hoards of ﬂour. On 14 July they converged on the massive
state prison of the Bastille, which commanded the entire east end of the
city with its guns. With the help of military deserters, they stormed the
The French Revolution

prison and forced its surrender, massacring the commander who had
ﬁred on them early in the attack. Paris was now in rebel hands. There
were certainly enough troops surrounding the city to subdue the revolt,
but commanders advised the king that they might not obey orders
to shoot. In these circumstances he was powerless, and ordered a
withdrawal. A counter-revolution had been defeated. The National
Assembly had been saved.

The ﬁrst reforms
The 14 July was not, therefore, the beginning of the French Revolution.
It was the end of the beginning. Nor did the opening of the grim and
mysterious Bastille release the expected host of languishing victims of
despotism. There were only seven prisoners. But the medieval fortress
was a symbol of royal power, and the spontaneous demolition of it
which began at once was equally symbolic of the end of a discredited
old order. Those who had orchestrated royal resistance over the month
since 17 June recognized the situation, too: the king’s brother Artois and
his closest courtier friends left the country at once, the ﬁrst émigrés.
After the king had been to Paris and, accepting the new tricolour
42

5. 14 July 1789: The taking of the Bastille

cockade of revolution from a hastily formed citizens’ militia (soon to
be called the National Guard), conﬁrmed a self-appointed municipal
administration, the National Assembly at last began work on the
constitution to which it had committed itself in the tennis court oath.
Binding mandates imposed by electors in the spring were abrogated,
and a preamble to the constitution, a declaration of rights, began to
be drafted. But by now upheavals in Paris and certain provincial cities
had spread to the countryside, where the weeks before the new
harvest ripened were marked by a ‘great fear’ that ‘brigands’ were
scouring the land to destroy crops and pillage helpless peasant
communities. In this paranoid atmosphere there were widespread
attacks on the houses of lords and the symbols of feudal power,
which, as the cahiers had shown, peasants regarded as the least
justiﬁable of the many burdens they bore. The men of property who
The French Revolution

made up the Assembly, whether owners of feudal rights or not, were
genuinely alarmed that the country was collapsing into anarchy. To
defuse the chaos, a radical group planned a dramatic gesture in
which feudal dues would be abolished. It was launched by a great
nobleman on the evening of 4 August, and was greeted with a rush
of enthusiasm in an Assembly that had impatiently held back from
positive action for much of the three months of its existence. Soon
more than feudal rights were proposed for abolition. All sorts of
privileges, the very lifeblood of ancien régime social organization,
were grandiloquently renounced. So was venality of ofﬁces, from
which many privileges had derived. Free justice was proclaimed, and
equality of taxation. The Church was deprived of tithes, the basic
income of the parish clergy. By the end of the session, when the
Assembly declared the king ‘Restorer of French Liberties’ much of the
fabric of French social life had been condemned to destruction in
the most radical few hours of the entire Revolution.
As several of those present observed, there had been a sort of magic
in the air that night: but the magic worked. Gradually rural disorder
subsided. The Assembly (now calling itself the National Constituent
44

Assembly) returned to its constitution-making. On 26 August it ﬁnally
promulgated a Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, and
over subsequent weeks it established the ﬁrst principles of a
constitutional monarchy, ruling out a bicameral legislature and granting
the king limited powers of veto on new laws. The king, however,
seemed in no hurry to accept this restriction, or indeed any of the great
measures enacted in August. Suspicions aroused in July now began to
fester anew in Paris, whose populace clearly regarded themselves as the
saviours and watchdogs of the Revolution. When, early in October, new
military arrivals were reported from Versailles by a Parisian press now
free and constantly proliferating, fear spread that the king was about to
attempt again what had failed in the summer. Sweeping aside attempts
by the National Guard to restrain them, thousands of women marched
on Versailles to coerce the king. There they invaded the hall of the
Assembly, broke into the palace, and threatened the life of the queen.
for the royal family to come with them to Paris. The monarch quickly
saw that he had little choice, and on 6 October he was escorted back to
his capital by the triumphant women. The Assembly followed a few days
later.

Polarization: religion
Louis XVI was now the prisoner of Paris. Apart from an ill-fated attempt
to escape in June 1791, he would remain so until the monarchy was
overthrown in August 1792. So, however, would the Assembly. Although
the deputies knew that they probably owed their survival to Parisian
popular action, most of them remained deeply uneasy about the
obligation. That was shown by their enactment of a martial law
against tumults, and by the way they conﬁned political rights under
the constitution to substantial taxpayers. Their aim was to set up a
constitutional monarchy controlled by the elected representatives of
substantial men of property. Their commitment to property owners
was also shown in their refusal to renounce the debt bequeathed by
45

How it happened

The only thing that would satisfy them, they eventually clamoured, was

absolute monarchy, and indeed a massive expansion of it by promises
to compensate all those, such as venal ofﬁce-holders, whose property
would disappear as a result of their reforms. They soon saw that all
this could not possibly be met out of taxation. Tax revenues, in fact,
were falling catastrophically in the absence of any effective means
of coercion. Their solution was to satisfy the nation’s creditors at the
expense of the Church.
By the abolition of tithe on 4 August the Assembly had already
committed itself to ecclesiastical reform. Finding an alternative source
of income for the parish clergy was not the least of the new obligations
it had taken on. But the Church remained rich in lands and endowments
and already on 4 August isolated voices had claimed that the rightful
owner of these assets was the Nation. On 2 November it was decided
The French Revolution

to place them ‘at the disposal of the Nation’. They were to be sold to
support an issue of state bonds, called assignats, in which other public
debts would be redeemed. To many clergy and devout laity these
measures looked like part of a wider attack on the Catholic faith. Amid
triumphant invocations of the philosophers who had attacked the
Church throughout the eighteenth century, the Assembly proclaimed
civil equality for Protestants and prohibited monastic vows. When
urged in April 1790 to declare Catholicism the state religion, it refused;
and by then civil strife had broken out between Catholics and
Protestants in the south, around Nîmes. Finally, given that the Nation
was now to pay the clergy out of public funds, the Assembly decided to
reorganize the Church in accordance with the same broad principles it
was applying to the country at large. And so the civil constitution of
the clergy, enacted in July 1790, provided for lay election of priests
and bishops, nationalization of ecclesiastical boundaries, and a purely
honoriﬁc role for the pope – who as a foreign ruler was not consulted on
any of these principles. Nor were the clergy themselves, which left many
of them uncertain whether such a radical reorganization was acceptable
to the Church as a whole. The Assembly saw their hesitation as a
deliberate obstruction of the national will, and in November imposed an
46

oath of obedience on all clergy. ‘Refractories’ who refused it were to be
ineligible for beneﬁces under the new order.
They expected that to settle matters; but in fact only around half of the
clergy complied. Many retracted when in the spring of 1791 the pope
publicly denounced the civil constitution. It was the beginning of the
ﬁrst, deepest, and most persistent polarization of the Revolution. As
revolutionary ‘patriots’ mobilized to promote compliance with the
oath, producing a massive expansion of the political ‘Jacobin’ clubs that
had begun to be established over the previous winter, counterrevolutionaries were quick to associate their own cause with threatened
Christianity. Acceptance of the sacraments from a ‘constitutional’ priest
who had taken the oath became a touchstone of loyalty to the entire
Revolution. No sincere Catholic could evade this decision; and this
included the king.

After his return to Paris, Louis XVI had grudgingly accepted all the
reforms of the Constituent Assembly, with occasional displays almost of
enthusiasm. He even sanctioned the ecclesiastical legislation, although
he privately knew of the pope’s hostility. It was soon obvious in the
spring of 1791, however, that he was avoiding receiving the sacraments
from constitutionals. Threatening demonstrations began to occur
around the Tuileries palace, for in Paris there was overwhelming support
for oath-taking. This renewed popular hostility determined the royal
family to attempt escape. On the night of 20 June they slipped out of
Paris, making for the eastern frontier. The king imprudently left behind
him an open letter denouncing much of the work of the Revolution. But
the fugitives were captured at Varennes, and brought back to Paris in
disgrace.
The ﬂight to Varennes opened up the second great schism of the
Revolution. There had been hardly any republicanism in 1789, and what

there was abated once the king was back in Paris and accepting all the
Assembly sent him. But, after Varennes, the mistrust built up by his long
record of apparent ambivalence burst out into widespread demands
from the populace of the capital and a number of radical publicists for
the king to be dethroned. Most members of the Assembly, however,
were horriﬁed, conniving hastily at the obvious ofﬁcial lie that the
keystone of their constitution had been abducted. When the Paris
Jacobin club ﬂirted with a republican petition, most deputies seceded
from it to form a more moderate ‘Feuillant’ club; and when crowds
gathered in the great military parade ground to the west of the city,
the Champ de Mars, to sign the same petition National Guards opened
ﬁre on them. The Assembly decided that the constitution must now
be quickly ﬁnished, and revised at the same time to make it more
acceptable to the king, so that normal political life could begin. After
hurried changes to exclude religious clauses and limit the freedom of
the king who, having publicly accepted it, was ofﬁcially reinstated. On
the last day of September, the Constituent Assembly came to an end,
its members having formally disqualiﬁed themselves from sitting in the
Legislative Assembly that was now to assume power.
The Legislative Assembly met in an atmosphere of international crisis.
For the ﬁrst time since 1787, the ﬂight to Varennes had made French
affairs a subject of concern rather than disdainful satisfaction to
foreign powers. In May 1790 the Constituent Assembly had positively
renounced war as an instrument of policy, except in self-defence. But
after the ignominious recapture of a king who appeared bent on
internationalizing his plight, other monarchs were alarmed. In the
Declaration of Pillnitz (27 August 1791) the Emperor and the king of
Prussia were induced by Louis XVI’s two émigré brothers, Artois and
Provence, to threaten military intervention. Thousands of army ofﬁcers
had joined the émigrés after Varennes, and were now massing across
the frontier dreaming of a return with foreign armies. The king and
queen shared these dreams; but the new deputies saw them as a

How it happened

the press and of political clubs, the constitution of 1791 was presented to

provocation. Over the autumn and winter their language became
hysterically belligerent towards the German princelings who harboured
the émigrés and, behind them, the Habsburg Emperor. They also sought
to provoke Louis XVI into compromising himself by passing decrees
intensifying penalties against refractory priests and émigrés which they
knew he would not sanction. General paranoia was intensiﬁed by news
of a massive slave uprising in the Caribbean, and the coffee and sugar
shortages that followed. Despite fears, evinced by Jacobins like
Robespierre, that the debilitated army was in no state to defeat the
disciplined forces of Austria and Prussia, most of the country was carried
away by war fever. The king (who shared Robespierre’s analysis but saw
it as a sign of hope for his own rescue) was therefore happy to declare

The French Revolution

war on the Emperor on 20 April 1792.

Polarization: war
War was the third great polarizing issue of the Revolution. As was
intended, it forced everybody to take sides on everything else. It
identiﬁed the defeat or survival of the Revolution with that of the nation
itself, so that critics of anything achieved since 1789 could be plausibly
stigmatized as traitors. Most vulnerable to this charge was the king
himself, who persisted in his vetoes of laws against refractories and
émigrés despite being mobbed in his palace on 20 June by Parisians now
calling themselves sansculottes. No doubt his resolution was steeled
by news of disasters from the front, as Prussia entered the war and
prepared to invade French territory. Even French generals called for
peace negotiations. But this too looked like little less than treason,
and the Assembly decreed the reinforcement of the line army by
National Guard volunteers (féderés). As they began to arrive in Paris,
those from Marseilles singing a new and bloodthirsty battle hymn that
would forever afterwards bear their name, the Prussian commander
threatened to destroy Paris if the king was harmed. That completed
the identiﬁcation of Louis XVI with the enemy, and on 10 August an
insurrectionary commune of Paris launched a force of sansculottes and
50

féderés against the royal palace. The king took refuge with the Assembly
while his Swiss life-guards were massacred defending his empty
residence; but this did not save his throne. The Assembly voted to
suspend the monarchy and convoke a new body elected by manhood
suffrage, the Convention, to draw up a republican constitution for the
country.
The full impact and implications of the overthrow of monarchy took the
rest of the year to become manifest. Meanwhile the Prussians pushed
into France, and Paris remained panic-stricken. A provisional executive
council dominated by the Parisian demagogue Danton frenziedly
attempted to organize defence with a series of draconian emergency
powers which ﬁlled the prisons with suspects. As patriotic sansculottes
were urged to join up, anxiety spread about a possible prison breakout
in their absence. On 2 September, as news arrived that the Prussians
out and massacred. The carnage went on for four days, leaving about
1400 victims dead, among them many refractory priests. Although
the inﬂammatory populist journalist Marat urged provincial France to
follow the capital’s example, news of the massacres horriﬁed opinion
both in France and abroad. This was something altogether more serious
than the occasional lynchings of 1789 and since, a grim lesson of what
happened if the lower orders were not kept under control. Enemies of
the Revolution had always predicted bloody chaos; those who wished it
well mostly found the massacres equally hard to justify. Everybody in
Paris, however, lived henceforth in the fear that they might very well
happen again.
And yet within weeks the crisis seemed to be over. On the day before
the Convention replaced the Legislative, a French army confronted the
Prussian invaders at Valmy and defeated them (20 September). It was
the beginning of six months of brilliant military success in which the
Austrian Netherlands and the left bank of the Rhine were overrun. By
November, intoxicated by the apparent ease of their success, the French
51

How it happened

had captured Verdun, prisons were broken into and their inmates taken

were offering ‘Fraternity and help to all peoples wishing to recover their
liberty’ and ‘war on the castles, peace to the cottages’ in the path of
their armies. They promised to implement revolutionary social policies
wherever they went, and make churches and nobles pay for the process.
‘We cannot be calm’, declared the journalist deputy Brissot, consistently
the leading advocate of war since October 1791, ‘until Europe, all
Europe, is in ﬂames.’ The challenge was compounded by the fate of
Louis XVI. The ﬁrst act of the Convention was to declare the monarchy
abolished. Later it would retrospectively date a new republican calendar
from this moment, the Year I of Liberty. That left the question of what
to do with ‘Louis Capet’ or ‘Louis the Last’. When it was argued that he
should be put on trial for crimes against the nation, some argued that
his very overthrow by the populace constituted a trial and guilty verdict.
But a trial before the Convention was eventually agreed, the indictment
The French Revolution

covering the king’s whole record since 1789. It took less than two days
in December, and despite the defendant’s denial of all the charges,
there was never any doubt what the verdict would be. Only the
sentence was contentious, a decision to execute him passing by a single
vote. There were also unsuccessful proposals to subject the result to a
referendum, and to grant clemency. But the majority knew that the
watching sansculottes would probably not have allowed either; and so
on 21 January 1793 the former king went to public execution. ‘You have
thrown down your gauntlet’, Danton exulted in the Convention, ‘and
this gauntlet is a king’s head!’

Civil war and terror
The challenge was soon taken up. Within days of the execution Great
Britain and the Dutch Republic joined the Republic’s enemies, soon
followed by Spain and several Italian states. When the Convention
sought to augment its armed forces by conscripting 300,000 new
recruits, there was widespread resistance across the west of the
country, where the persecution of refractory priests had already caused
rioting. In the Vendée, south of the Loire, civil war was soon raging, with

the rebels organizing themselves into a self-styled ‘Catholic and Royal
Army’ dedicated to restoring the heirs of the martyred king. Now, too,
the war against the Republic’s foreign enemies began to go badly.
French forces were driven out of the Rhineland and Belgium, where their
general deserted to the enemy. The crisis exacerbated long-standing
political divisions within the Convention. The advocates of open-ended
war, led by Brissot and a number of Bordeaux deputies whom
Robespierre called the ‘faction of the Gironde’ thought that it could and
should be conducted without compromising the Revolution’s original
and representative principles at home. It was they who sought national
endorsement of the judgements against the king. And, in the wake
of the September massacres, the Girondins argued loudly against
the intimidation of the Convention’s proceedings by the bloodstained
populace of Paris. These stances won them expulsion from the
The French Revolution

Jacobin club, whose leaders, such as Robespierre, were soon called
Montagnards (literally ‘mountain men’, from the high benches they
occupied in the Convention). Montagnards, apart from personal dislike,
thought the Girondins’ vendetta against Paris suicidally distracting from
more practical priorities. They saw no safe alternative to humouring the
sansculottes, even if that meant turning a blind eye to their more violent
instincts and excesses. By May, with bad news arriving from all sides,
they had concluded that the only way to silence the Girondins was to
accept sansculotte demands for their expulsion from the Convention.
On 2 June, 29 of them were arrested.
The immediate effect was only to intensify the crisis. Already restive at
their inability to inﬂuence events in Paris, several provincial cities now
came out into open revolt. Over the summer, Marseille, Bordeaux, and
Lyon were beyond the Convention’s control, and at the end of August
the great Mediterranean naval port of Toulon surrendered to the British.
On 13 July, meanwhile, Marat, the journalistic idol of the sansculottes,
was assassinated in his bath by Charlotte Corday, an insurgent from
Caen. Much of this so-called ‘Federalist Revolt’ was not counterrevolutionary in the way the Vendée uprising quite explicitly was. It was
54

a protest against extremism and instability in the capital. But rebellion,
however motivated, in time of war was undoubtedly treasonable; and
as, over the autumn, the Convention’s forces re-established control over
centres which proved unable to coordinate their efforts, rebel leaders
and activists paid the traitors’ penalty. Almost 14,000 were sentenced
to death by special courts in the provinces over the autumn and winter.
Over half were in the west, where the last Vendéan army was defeated
in December. Some were shot or drowned, but most died under the
instrument that had dispatched the king, the guillotine – introduced
only in April 1792 and designed as a humane means of execution by
rational men who failed to foresee the effect of the rivers of blood it
released when used on large numbers of victims.
The aim of such retribution was as much to terrorize as to punish;
and by September the sansculottes, unable to understand why the
results, were pressing for terror to be adopted as a principle of
government. Intimidated once more by mass demonstrations on 5
September, the Convention declared terror the order of the day.
Within a few weeks it had decreed the arrest of all suspects, expanded
a revolutionary tribunal established earlier in the year to try political
crimes, imposed price controls on all basic commodities (the
‘maximum’), and authorized so-called ‘revolutionary armies’ of
sansculottes to force peasants to disgorge their surpluses to feed the
cities. The government of the Republic was now to be ‘revolutionary
until the peace’ – centralized, arbitrary, and armed with emergency
powers, all the very opposite of the constitutional conduct of affairs to
which the Revolution had committed itself from the outset.
Now the Girondins arrested in June, and the hated widow of Louis XVI,
Marie-Antoinette, were sent to the scaffold, for what they symbolized
as much as for what they had done. A number of deputies, dispatched
to disturbed provinces as ‘representatives on mission’ and invested with
the full powers of the Convention also began to identify, reasonably
55

How it happened

elimination of their legislator enemies had not produced more positive

enough in many cases, religion as the life-blood of counter-revolution.
They decided to ‘dechristianize’ their districts, and by November this
fashion reached Paris. As a new ‘revolutionary calendar’ replaced the
old Christian one, large numbers of churches began to be closed. The
aim was to stamp out all forms of Christian practice if not belief. The
government, now largely vested in the hands of the Convention’s
Committee of Public Safety, never ofﬁcially sponsored a policy which it
recognized as likely to alienate more citizens than it won over, but
before it was strong enough to stem the dechristianizing tide in the
spring of 1794, virtually every church in France had been closed down,
and throughout much of this ‘Year II of Liberty’ most priests were in
exile or hiding.
Terror appeared to have achieved its purpose of crushing internal
The French Revolution

opposition from every quarter. Even the sansculottes, drafted into the
service of a ruthless and decisive state, seemed satisﬁed. The fortunes
of war were improving too. The levée en masse, an attempt to mobilize
the Nation’s entire human resources, proclaimed in August 1793, was
helping to man and equip armies of unprecedented size. Late in
December the British were driven from Toulon, and by the spring the
Republic’s territory was once more free from foreign occupation. By now
some deputies were arguing for an end to terror. When popular leaders
in Paris, called Hébertistes after their journalist spokesman Hébert,
attempted to silence terror’s critics by mounting a coup d’état, they
were outmanoeuvred by the Committee of Public Safety and
themselves guillotined. But Robespierre, increasingly the dominant
voice on the committee, was also suspicious of the self-serving motives
of the so-called ‘indulgents’, all friends of the unpredictable Danton,
and three weeks later (5 April 1794) it was their turn to be executed. The
rhythm of terror began to accelerate again, and with all political trials
now channelled through the Paris revolutionary tribunal, the 2000
victims condemned there down to July made more impact on the world
outside than the thousands more who had perished in previous months
in the provinces. In early June the last judicial safeguards for innocence
56

her way to the scaffold

were removed by the notorious Law of 22 prairial, two days after the
introduction under Robespierre’s sponsorship of a new, non-Christian
state religion, the cult of the Supreme Being.
This was the period of the so-called ‘Great Terror’, often known, too,
from the moralistic rationale given to it in the speeches of Robespierre,
as the Republic of Virtue. Political crimes were now so widely deﬁned
that nobody felt safe. Many were now being executed almost for their
counter-revolutionary potential alone: the number of noble victims,
for instance, hitherto quite modest, rose markedly. What nobody could
imagine was how it would all end, since even to express doubt about
the need for terror was to invite suspicion. And yet the necessity for
government by bloodletting was less and less obvious. The whole
country was now ﬁrmly back under the Convention’s control, and the
The French Revolution

armies were taking the war once more to the enemy. People began to
blame the continuing terror on the suspicious mind of Robespierre, and
a group of deputies who feared they might be his next target began
to plot against him. Matters came to a head in a confrontation in the
Convention on 26 July, when the ‘Incorruptible’ underwent the novel
experience of being shouted down. He appealed for support the next
day to the Jacobin club and to the sansculottes; but not enough rallied
to him to make his appeal seem more than deﬁance of the Convention.
He was outlawed, which meant that when he was arrested there was no
need for a trial. Having failed to kill himself prior to arrest, he and his
closest associates were guillotined on 28 July.

The thermidorean dilemma
The fall of Robespierre, on 9 thermidor in the revolutionary calendar,
has often been seen as the end of the Revolution. It was nothing of the
sort. The terror, which did come to an end with his execution, was
certainly a spectacular climax to developments since 1789, but it solved
none of the problems which had torn the Revolution apart – religion,
monarchy, and war. In fact it added another, in the form of Jacobinism.
58

Outside France, the term had become as early as 1790 shorthand for
all the Revolution’s excesses. Now it began to acquire the same
connotations in France – a legacy of clubs, populism, social levelling,
and authoritarianism in the name of these principles, all underpinned
by terror. The so-called Thermidoreans in the Convention who had
taken over power were committed to dismantling all that had made
Jacobinism possible. Thus the prisons were emptied of suspects, the
Jacobin club and its afﬁliates closed, economic controls like the
maximum abandoned. The assignats, whose value had been eroded
by massive overissue after war broke out, had been somewhat sustained
as legal tender by the controlled economy of the Year II: now they went
into free fall. As in 1788–9 accidents of nature exacerbated the situation.
A mediocre harvest and perhaps the coldest winter since 1709 left the
sansculottes so miserable that by the spring they were clamouring for
a return to the times when bread and blood were both plentiful. In
the Convention was twice mobbed by angry crowds and a deputy was
lynched. But they lacked the old organization, and for the ﬁrst time
since 1789 the authorities felt they could rely on soldiers to restore
domestic order. The Convention spurned the insurgents’ demands; and
although latter-day Jacobins would continue to dream of a return to
the Year II, the people of Paris were ﬁnished as a political force for two
generations. Hitherto persecuted Catholics and Royalists now began
to take their revenge. In Paris, extravagantly clad ‘gilded youths’ beat
up veteran sansculottes and Jacobin activists, while in the south a
far-reaching ‘White Terror’ brought informal but brutal retribution to
those who had wielded local power during the Year II.
If the recent past had been a series of terrible mistakes, when had they
begun? Probably, thought the Thermidoreans, in 1791. Their dream was
to recover the lost consensus and civic idealism of the early revolution.
That meant conciliating those alienated in the meantime – Catholics
and Royalists. And so although the Republic now disclaimed any religion,
churches were allowed to reopen, and the policy of depopulation
59

April and May (germinal and prairial in the revolutionary calendar)

applied in the Vendée over the Year II was ostentatiously abandoned.
Serious talk was also heard in the spring of 1795 of restoring monarchy
in the person of Louis XVI’s surviving son, a sickly child who might be
made acceptable by a carefully controlled, public-spirited education.
These hopes, however, were destroyed in June 1795 when ‘Louis XVII’
died; and from his exile in Verona the next month, his uncle the
Count de Provence proclaimed his own succession as Louis XVIII in a
chillingly uncompromising declaration which promised an almost total
restoration of the old regime in the event of his return. That obviously
meant giving back national lands to the Church and to émigrés who
had incurred conﬁscation once war broke out. Some émigrés chose
this moment to demonstrate their continued intransigence by
attempting to invade Brittany with British support in the hope of
marching on Paris at the head of a horde of Breton Royalists. They never
The French Revolution

got beyond the beaches at Quiberon and were shot in their hundreds by
their republican captors.
All this blighted any hopes of a restoration. Yet, conscious that the
Convention had been elected to give France a new constitution,
the deputies knew they had now sat long enough. Technically, a
constitution already existed: an extremely democratic one, embodying
various provisions for social welfare and even the right to legalized
insurrection, had been framed and adopted in 1793 in the aftermath
of the downfall of the Girondins. It had been suspended at once for the
war’s duration. The insurgents of germinal and prairial had called for
it to be implemented, but that alone ensured that it was unthinkable.
Accordingly the Convention spent the summer of 1795 elaborating a
new republican constitution, more heavily dependent on large property
owners even than that of 1791. It was full of elaborate checks and
balances, including annual elections and a constantly rotating ﬁve-man
executive, the Directory. Nor did its drafters make what they saw as the
fundamental mistake of 1791 by excluding themselves from the new
machinery. Indeed, they insisted that two-thirds of the ﬁrst deputies
in the two new legislative ‘councils’ should be drawn from their own
60

ranks. Royalists, who had hoped that they might win free elections,
were outraged, but a mass protest in Paris was dispersed by the army
under the command of young general Bonaparte (insurrection of
vendémiaire: 5 October).

The Directory
During all this time, French armies had been triumphant everywhere.
Belgium was overrun, and annexed under the doctrine ﬁrst proclaimed
in 1793, of France’s ‘natural’ frontiers along the Rhine. The Dutch
Republic was invaded, and surrendered. The Prussians and the
Spaniards made peace. By the end of 1795 only the Austrians and the
British were still at war with the Republic, and neither of them
threatened its territory. For 1796 a knockout blow was planned against
the Emperor, with armies striking towards Vienna from Germany and
supposed to be secondary, but in the twelve months from April 1796
he drove the Austrians out of Italy to within striking distance of their
capital, and on his own initiative concluded peace preliminaries at
Leoben.
Even the British were now negotiating; but the results of the ﬁrst regular
elections under the constitution of 1795 led all parties to drag their
feet. The Directory had begun, in the aftermath of the vendémiaire
insurrection, in a militant mood, and concessions were made to
Jacobins persecuted since germinal and prairial. But they emerged
radicalized from prison and hiding, and by the spring of 1796 some were
calling for the 1793 constitution and the equalization of property. Forced
underground again, a small group led by the journalist Babeuf plotted
a coup. This ‘conspiracy of equals’, the ﬁrst attempt at communistic
revolution in history, was soon thwarted; but it provoked a new swing
to the right which was reﬂected in the results of the 1797 elections.
In a reaction against the remaining ‘perpetuals’ of the Convention,
conservative and Royalist deputies were much reinforced, giving the

Italy. The Italian command was given to Bonaparte. The front was

British and Austrians hopes of a more advantageous peace than their
military position warranted. Fearing that the fruits of his Italian victories
might be jeopardized, Bonaparte gave his support to three of the
directors equally alarmed by the reactionary tide. In the coup of
fructidor Year V (September 1797), election results were annulled in over
half the departments, and 177 deputies were purged. Both subsequent
rounds of election under the directorial constitution, in 1798 and 1799,
would also be adjusted in accordance with political convenience; so
that this constitution was never allowed the time and opportunity to
work freely. There is little wonder that so few in 1799 would mourn its
passing.
Meanwhile fructidor seemed to justify itself by results. The very next
month the Austrians made peace at Campo Formio, recognizing the loss
The French Revolution

of Belgium and their old Italian possessions, now transformed by
Bonaparte into the Cisalpine Republic, a French puppet state. At home,
a conﬁdent new Directory broke the Revolution’s longest-standing
commitment by renouncing most of the state’s debts. It acted too with
renewed harshness against priests and nobles. The British, however, so
far from following their Austrian allies in coming to terms, now chose to
ﬁght on alone, emphasizing their naval power in October 1797 in the
victory of Camperdown. Bonaparte, back from Italy, was put in charge
of invasion plans; but soon decided that the commercial British were
more likely to make peace if France could threaten the source of their
wealth in India. This at any rate was the main justiﬁcation for his
expedition to Egypt in May 1798 – although the directors were happy
enough to see such an ambitious general go. The diplomatic effect,
however, especially after Nelson cut him off in Egypt by destroying his
ﬂeet at the battle of the Nile in August, was to trigger the formation of a
new coalition led by Russia. When Austria allowed Russian troops to
cross her territory to reach the French adversary in Italy, the whole
peninsula rose up against the puppet regimes set up there by Bonaparte
and his successors. The French withdrew, taking the pope with them as
a prisoner, and he died in French captivity. Suddenly the Republic
62

seemed as dangerously isolated as in 1793. Was the answer the same as
it had been then? Amid talk of forced loans and hostage-taking, General
Jourdan moved a comprehensive law on conscription. The effect was to
stir up the west once more, and produce a new Vendée in the form of a
priest-led peasant uprising in the annexed Belgian territories (October
1798). It was soon put down, but the military crisis lasted until new
victories the next summer, and prolonged political uncertainties as
neo-Jacobins opened clubs and clamoured for emergency measures to
save the country. Sieyès, re-emerging as a director after years of
prudent obscurity, concluded that the constitution was unworkable.
What France needed was ‘authority from above, conﬁdence from
below’. He cast about for a reliable general to help him mount a coup. It
was at this moment that Napoleon Bonaparte made his famous escape
from the isolation of Egypt.

He was more than willing to cooperate with Sieyès in dissolving the
legislative councils in brumaire Year VIII (November 1799), but he,
rather than his would-be patron had the decisive voice in framing the
new authoritarian constitution which was promulgated after a hasty
referendum in December. It invested Napoleon with practically limitless
powers as First Consul of the Republic. ‘Citizens’, he proclaimed, ‘the
Revolution is established on the principles with which it began. It is
over.’
None of this was true, but over the next two years Napoleon ensured
that the second sentence at least began to seem credible. By defeating
the Austrians (himself at Marengo in 1800, and through General Moreau
at Hohenlinden the next year) he ended the war on the continent. The
war-weary British gave up the struggle too in 1802 at the peace of
Amiens. The revolutionary war was won, in a complete victory for
France. That in turn gave Napoleon the strength to dash all Louis XVIII’s
hopes that he might prove the instrument of a Bourbon restoration. If
63

How it happened

Napoleon

France was to have a monarch, Napoleon himself was now a more
credible candidate, as he was to demonstrate by crowning himself in
1804. By then, too, he had deprived the Bourbons of their main source
of support by settling the quarrel between France and Rome. Under the
concordat negotiated with a new pope, Pius VII, in 1801, open Catholic
worship was restored in France and paid for by the state. But to secure
this deal, the pope was forced to recognize Napoleon’s one
precondition: that the lands of the Church conﬁscated and sold since
1789 were gone for ever. Their new owners could at last feel secure in
their gains, and became natural supporters of the new regime, rather
than of the only parties hitherto to promise them such guarantees – the
discredited Directory, and the bloodstained Jacobins. The Brumaire
coup itself had been gloriﬁed as saving the country from these two
tainted prescriptions, and shortly afterwards the last Jacobin activists
The French Revolution

were rounded up and blamed when desperate Royalists tried to
assassinate the First Consul. The nationwide sigh of relief was practically
audible. Napoleonic rule would bring its own problems and
contradictions, but it endured because it began by resolving others that
had torn the country apart for more than a decade.

64

Chapter 4
What it ended

The initial impulse of the French Revolution was destructive. The
revolutionaries wanted to abolish what, by the end of 1789, everybody
was calling the old or former order, the ancien régime. When, in the
summer of 1791, the Constituent Assembly ﬁnalized the constitution
on which it had been working since June 1789, the deputies thought it
would be useful in such a fundamental document to list the main things
that their revolution had got rid of, what they called ‘the institutions
which wounded liberty and equality of rights’. And so the constitution
declared that:
There is no longer either a nobility or a peerage, or hereditary
distinctions, or distinctions of orders, or a feudal regime, or any of the
corporations or decorations for which proofs of nobility were required, or
which implied distinctions of birth, or any other superiority but that of
public ofﬁcials in the exercise of their duties.

There is no longer venality or heredity of public ofﬁce.

There is no longer for any part of the nation or for any individual any
privilege or exception to the common law of all the French.

There are no longer either guilds, or corporations of professions, arts and
crafts.
65

The law no longer recognizes either religious vows or any other
engagement contrary to natural rights and the constitution.

The list was far from exhaustive. In the constitution, it came
immediately after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen,
which by proclaiming a number of principles of political and civil life,
implicitly condemned practices opposed to them in previous times. The
extended declaration which prefaced the never-implemented
constitution of 1793 made this even more clear: ‘The necessity of
declaring these rights presupposes the presence or the recent memory
of despotism.’ As the Revolution proceeded, the range of its destructive
ambitions widened. By 1793 they were so comprehensive that an
outraged priest coined a new word to describe them: vandalism,
evoking the anti-Christian depredations of ancient barbarians. On the
The French Revolution

other hand, the Revolution’s destructive achievements often fell far
short of its ambitions; and what the men of 1789 or 1793 thought they
had abolished forever often reappeared, and quite soon, in forms
ostensibly different but which those who had survived had no difﬁculty
in recognizing with dismay.

Despotism
The Revolution began as an attack on despotism. Montesquieu had
deﬁned it in De l’Esprit des lois (1748) as the rule of one, according to no
law. Obeying no law, despotic authority was arbitrary, and its animating
spirit was fear. As usual, regular usage soon diluted the original rigour
of the word’s meaning. Already by 1762, Rousseau was implying in his
Social Contract that there was no meaningful difference between
the authority of a despot and that of a monarch. By the end of that
decade despotism was widely understood as the abuse of monarchical
power, and indeed of any sort of authority. By 1789 this had come to
mean above all imposing taxation without consent, arbitrary powers of
arrest and imprisonment, stiﬂing freedom of expression and opinion,
and the activities of all who served these purposes, such as ministers
66

and intendants. In a word, no distinction was now drawn between
despotism, tyranny, and absolute monarchy.
The Revolution provided an opportunity to dispense with it all. By
locating sovereign power in the Nation, it made the king France’s
servant, not its master. By subjecting him and all other ofﬁcials to a
constitution, it sought to replace the rule of arbitrariness by the rule
of law. There was of course plenty of law under the old regime – too
much, the revolutionaries thought. They saw one of their longer-term
tasks as its simpliﬁcation and codiﬁcation. But the king had appeared
able to override any of it with impunity. That was why the Bastille
was such a powerful symbol – it was where unnamed state prisoners
could be conﬁned without trial, under the notorious lettres de cachet,
sealed warrants signed by the king and revocable only by him. Once
demolished, the Bastille was never rebuilt, and all that remains where
it once stood is the outline of its plan in the cobblestones. Almost as
1789, the great palace which Louis XIV had made the seat of absolute
monarchy. It was too big to demolish (though not to vandalize) but
not even Napoleon, whose real power dwarfed that wielded by Louis
XVI, thought it wise to move in there when he became a crowned
ruler with a court. It evoked too many undesirable memories. Nor did
Louis XVI’s brothers return there after the Bourbons were restored in
1815. Even they recognized that the old nerve-centre of absolute
monarchy was an inappropriate residence for constitutional rulers.
Louis-Philippe, who followed them, saw that its only possible use now
was as a museum.

Aristocracy
But Versailles was more than a symbol of political authority. With its
glittering population of titled courtiers, it also symbolized a whole social
system dominated by a privileged nobility. From the autumn of 1788,
the Revolution acquired a social thrust, and that thrust was anti-noble.
67

What it ended

powerfully symbolic was the abandonment of Versailles on 6 October

By the middle of 1789, aristocracy was the term used to encapsulate all
that the Revolution was against. It was the quarrel over the form of the
Estates-General which brought these preoccupations to the surface,
and the loud and prolonged resistance of most nobles to giving up the
guaranteed share of future political power that the ‘forms of 1614’ held
out to them. Insults and exaggerations exchanged then could not be
expunged; and despite the constructive role played by many noble
deputies once the orders were merged, the emigration of others, and
the gratuitously obstructionist behaviour of some who remained,
ensured that suspicions about the nobility never died away. In June
1790 nobility itself, and the display of its appurtenances like titles and
coats of arms, were forbidden by law, which only increased the sense
among most nobles that they were aliens in the land of their birth. After
fructidor in 1797, in the reaction against the renewed threat of royalism,
The French Revolution

nobles were indeed legally made aliens, and deprived of their rights as
French citizens. They were now ci-devants, relics of a former time, no
better than the thousands of their traitrous relatives who had emigrated
rather than live in a country so changed.
Once war began, émigrés who refused to return, and for a time even
those related to them, were deprived of their property. It was added
to the saleable stock of national lands. But noble property was under
attack almost from the beginning, in the form of the ‘feudal regime’
abolished on the night of 4 August 1789. Feudal rights were not always
very lucrative, and their incidence varied enormously. But there was
no doubt of their vast symbolic signiﬁcance, as earlier peasant attacks
on weather vanes and other lordly appurtenances bear witness. And
although, recognized by the Assembly as a form of property, dues
were supposed to go on being levied until bought out, most peasants
stopped paying them at once and never offered compensation. In 1793,
the Convention conﬁrmed the fait accompli, and the ‘time of the lords’
rapidly became a mere folk memory. But the abolition of the feudal
regime was only the most direct blow suffered by nobles as a result
of the night of 4 August. What began as an attempt to pacify the
68

peasantry soon broadened out into an attack on privileges in general.
Nobles were already resigned to the loss of their separate ﬁscal status,
and to a regime of careers open to talents rather than to birth or
inheritance. These had been the overwhelming demand of the third
estate cahiers, and many noble ones had also endorsed them. Now
they passed into law. More subtle was the impact of the abolition of
venality of ofﬁces. The ostensible point was to open the judiciary to
talent and ability; but venality had been the source of many of the
privileges that had proliferated since the sixteenth century, and
through the sale of ennobling ofﬁces it had become the main avenue
of entry into the nobility. The whole character of the French nobility
had been transformed by these procedures; but now it simply ceased to
recruit – a recipe for eventual extinction.

Corporatism and privilege
implementing decree of 11 August put it: ‘All particular privileges of
provinces, principalities, countries, cantons, towns and communities of
inhabitants, whether pecuniary or of any other nature, are irrevocably
abolished, and will remain absorbed into the common law of all French
people.’ This was to consign the whole chaotic and luxuriant variety of
the old regime to oblivion and open the way to a more rational and
uniform organization of the country and of society. The old order had
been corporative, every organization deﬁning itself by its privileges and
monopolies. But the revolutionaries of 1789 did not believe in
monopolies of any sort, which they saw as conspiracies against the
public or national interest. This included all types of professional
organizations and trade guilds, which were abolished by the Allarde Law
of 23 April 1791; and combinations of artisans, primitive trade unions,
forbidden by the Le Chapelier law of 14 June following, which declared
‘the annihilation of all sorts of corporations of citizens of the same
calling or profession’ to be ‘one of the fundamental bases of the French
constitution’.
69

What it ended

But the bonﬁre of privileges on 4 August was general. As the

The greatest corporation of all was of course the Church: independently
wealthy, largely self-governing, and owing part of its allegiance to a
foreign potentate beyond the Alps. As with the nobility, the clergy’s loss
of separate representation in the Estates-General heralded far more
substantial damage. Clerical electors had hoped that the new regime
would strengthen the role of the Catholic Church in national life after
two generations of philosophic erosion, but instead the clergy found
themselves appalled and apprehensive at the uncompensated abolition
of tithe on 4 August. Religious freedom, vouchsafed a few weeks later in
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, was a further blow
to their spiritual monopoly. The conﬁscation of Church lands in
November spelled the ﬁnal end of the Church’s independence; and
made inevitable too the dissolution of monasteries and the abrogation
of monastic vows in the following spring. The elective civil constitution
The French Revolution

of the clergy then destroyed the hierarchical autonomy of the Church,
and priestly protests that one way or another it must give its consent to
any such changes only aroused the anti-corporative fury of the National
Assembly.

The confessional state
It was not surprising that the pope anathematized the civil constitution,
and his enmity was only conﬁrmed in September 1791 when France
annexed his territories of Avignon and the Comtat-Venaissin. All this
meant that, when France went to war the next year, French soldiers
would make a particular point of attacking ecclesiastical institutions
and installations wherever they went. By the Year II the Republic had
even abandoned the ‘constitutional’ church created under the
Constituent Assembly, and had become the enemy of all religious
establishment. In September 1794, although the extremes of
dechristianization were over, the Republic renounced all religious
afﬁliations; but throughout the Directory there were periodic
crackdowns on suspect refractory clergy, when hundreds were sent to
the ‘dry guillotine’ of Guiana in South America, while in Germany and
70

Italy territories ruled by the Church were secularized. The young
Napoleon, still making his reputation, was too cautious to do more than
bully the pope. But generals who succeeded him in 1798 dissolved the
papal states, set up a secular ‘Roman Republic’, and carried the pontiff
off to captivity in France. Many thought that when Pius VI died there in
August 1799 the papacy itself had come to an end.

Dynastic diplomacy
It was saved by the Austrians, who allowed a conclave to meet in Venice
several months later. They did it mainly to spite the French enemy which
had plagued them since 1792. In diplomatic terms the wars of the
French Revolution brought to an end an uneasy and unpopular alliance
with Austria which went back to 1755 and was blamed both for the
disasters of the Seven Years War and for bringing Marie-Antoinette to
France. But even before the break with Austria, the revolutionaries had
of Spain called upon France, in the name of the long-standing ‘Family
Compact’ between the Bourbon rulers of the two kingdoms, to back
Spain against Great Britain in a territorial dispute over Nootka Sound
(on the Paciﬁc coast of North America), the National Assembly refused.
The new France, it declared, would only ﬁght to preserve its national
territory from attack and not to honour the private compacts of
dynasts. ‘It is not’, one deputy later declared, ‘the treaties of princes
which govern the rights of nations.’ This seemed to turn into something
like principle the diplomatic nullity that France had fallen into in
1787, and which the decay of her army in the meantime had only
compounded. That decay proved irreversible, as early defeats in the war
of 1792 showed; and even if it was the trained artillery of the old regime
which saved the new republic at Valmy, by the beginning of 1793 it was
obvious that an entirely new sort of army would be required to ﬁght
the war of national survival that the conﬂict so thoughtlessly launched
the previous April had become. The new army, capitalizing on the
advantage of France’s vast population, would be made up largely of

mercenaries. Nor would its tactics and behaviour be the self-contained,
tightly controlled manoeuvres of old regime forces, dependent on their
baggage trains and more concerned to preserve their own expensive
existence than to take battle to the enemy. The restraint and timidity
of old regime warfare can easily be caricatured and exaggerated;
nevertheless it was mild indeed compared with the all-out conﬂict
waged by the French – and, increasingly, their adversaries – over the
next generation. So dynastic diplomacy, and the style of warfare which
had underpinned it, scarcely survived the 1790s. When Napoleon, who
built a career on mastery of the new way of ﬁghting, attempted to
buttress his monarchical pretensions by marrying an Austrian princess
in 1810, it took only three years before he found himself once more at

war with his father-in-law in Vienna.

Colonial slavery
It was of course the costs of war that had brought down the old
monarchy, but the crucial element in the escalation of those costs had
not been the army. What had been really ruinous was the added
burden of naval competition with Great Britain, where the stakes were
not dynastic advantage, but worldwide economic hegemony. French
hopes here had been blighted by the defeats of the Seven Years War,
but not destroyed. And even if helping the Americans to their
independence had not yielded the hoped-for beneﬁts, fortunes in the
Indian Ocean revived, French islands were the most ﬂourishing in the
Caribbean, and the ports serving them, such as Bordeaux and Nantes,
were the most spectacularly expanding cities in the kingdom. The
Revolution ruined all this for ever. A movement proclaiming equality
and freedom provoked turmoil in islands built on slavery and racial
discrimination. In Saint-Domingue, the most valuable territory on
earth in 1789, chaos among whites and mixed-race creoles opened the
way three years later to a massive uprising among the 450,000 black
72

slaves – the greatest slave revolt in history, and the most successful.
Attempts to re-establish control in 1793 culminated in the ﬁrst
abolition of slavery in modern times, endorsed by the Convention in
Paris in February 1794. But by then renewed war against Great Britain
had severed links with overseas colonies. Attempts by Napoleon during
the peace of Amiens in 1802 to reimpose slavery by a military
expedition to Saint-Domingue also failed, and in its aftermath the
former slaves established the independent state of Haiti. Meanwhile
the French slave trade had collapsed, and the economy of the great
Atlantic ports shrivelled. The population of Bordeaux shrank by 15 per
cent between 1790 and 1801, and seven years later Napoleon was
shocked by the emptiness of its immense quayside. By then, the main
impediment to maritime trade was the British navy, which had
completely destroyed its French rival between 1798 and 1805, and
used its triumph to impose the tightest blockade ever known on the
continental coastline. But when the wars ﬁnally ended, there was
sugar, and coffee. When, a generation later, French imperial
ambitions revived, Africa and Indochina would be the main targets,
and commercial incentives, which had driven the creation of the
pre-revolutionary empire, were secondary.

Redrawn maps
And by then not only the French empire had fallen apart. As early as
1795 French armies destroyed the Dutch Republic and, by forcing its
successor ‘Batavian’ sister-republic into an alliance against the British,
opened Dutch colonies in three continents to the hostile depredations
of the tyrant of the seas. Meanwhile the oldest political entity in
Europe, the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire of the German
Nation, was steadily dismembered, a process accelerated by Napoleon
and brought to a conclusion in 1806 when he forced Francis II to resign
the imperial crown and retreat into a purely Austrian hereditary
monarchy. Nobody ever thought seriously of trying to revive the corpse
73

What it ended

no hope of ever reconstructing the old Atlantic economy of slaves,

when Napoleon fell nine years later. When, ﬁnally, Napoleon deposed
the Spanish Bourbons in 1808 and ﬂooded Spain with French troops,
the world’s largest and furthest-ﬂung colonial empire absolved itself
from any obligation to obey orders from Madrid. Some parts, such as
Venezuela, declared their independence almost immediately. Bolívar,
the ‘Liberator’ who led this movement, had once idolized Napoleon as
a republican hero and saw the establishment of the French empire as
a betrayal of revolutionary ideals. But in any case attempts by the
reactionary Ferdinand VII to reimpose the old regime after the Bourbon
restoration in Spain merely provoked the whole of Spanish South
America into republican resistance. It had triumphed everywhere by
the mid-1820s, the last ripples of the republicanism launched in Paris

The French Revolution

in 1792.

Achievable dreams
For those who lived through all, or even part, of these vast upheavals,
the shock was overwhelming. From June 1789 onwards, the diaries and
observations of contemporaries echo with wonder and increasing
horror at the scale of what was occurring. Nobody was prepared for it.
And although from the start revolutionaries were happy to depict their
movement as the triumph of eighteenth-century ‘philosophy’ and
Enlightenment (an analysis ruefully accepted by most of their critics and
enemies), it is hard to imagine either Voltaire or Rousseau revelling in
the events which, from only eleven years after their deaths, were often
so glibly attributed to their inﬂuence. Robespierre, as proud a disciple as
any of the Enlightenment, declared: ‘Political writers . . . had in no way
foreseen this Revolution.’ They had expected that reform, if it came at
all, would occur gradually and piecemeal, and would be the work of
enlightened authoritarians rather than elected representatives. In these
circumstances, the sort of headlong, comprehensive change
undertaken by the revolutionaries was exhilarating. The English poet
Wordsworth was far from the only person to feel it a blissful moment to
be alive, and that change was possible:
74

Not in Utopia, subterranean ﬁelds
Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!
But in the very world, which is the world
Of all of us . . .

Nothing, in other words, needed to be accepted any more as set in
the nature of things. If the mighty French monarchy, the nobility and
the feudal law from which it justiﬁed its pre-eminence, not to
mention the Catholic Church itself, could be challenged and rejected
on grounds of rationality, utility, and humanity, then nothing was
beyond challenge. Dreams of all sorts were achievable. Rousseau had
taught that human society was hopelessly corrupt and corrupting,
and that only total change could redeem it. That was why he was
such a hero to the revolutionaries: they had proved his vision to be
possible. Never again would institutions, habits, or beliefs be
accepted merely because this was how they had always been or were
overturned for ever an innocent world of unquestioning compliance
where most things seemed beyond change or remedy. The German
philosopher Kant, in a famous essay of 1784, had deﬁned
Enlightenment as mankind’s emancipation from self-imposed
immaturity, and unwillingness to think freely for oneself. The
proposition was purely intellectual. Kant thought Enlightenment
could only progress slowly, and that a revolution would never
produce a true reform in ways of thinking. Five years later, he
changed his mind. Although he believed that no revolution was ever
justiﬁed, he convinced himself that what had happened in France was
a voluntary surrender of power by Louis XVI, because he recognized
that the moment of emancipation from unthinking routines and
supine reﬂexes had suddenly arrived.

75

What it ended

Resistance and persistence
And yet: although the Revolution symbolized the assertion of political
will against the constraints of history, circumstance, and vested interest,
revolutionaries soon found themselves learning the hard lesson that will
alone was not enough to destroy the old regime. It fought back; and it is
the strength and determination of resistance and counter-revolution
that largely explains the ferocity of the terror. And when all the strength
that the revolutionaries could muster had been spent, terror abandoned,
and Napoleon ﬁnally defeated, many of the things that revolutionaries
had sought to destroy in and after 1789 were still there, or had rapidly
re-emerged. Napoleon himself, whose career is inconceivable without
the Revolution, was responsible for many of the revivals. He in turn

The French Revolution

saw them as the mere recognition of political realities.
Despite dechristianization, religious practice had not been stamped out.
In fact, it was the mainspring of opposition to the new order, and
showed no sign of abating. The concordat with the pope, however,
reconciled Catholics with the new regime by re-establishing their
Church. Similarly with nobility. Born a noble himself, Napoleon knew as
well as anyone that blue blood could not be abolished short of
exterminating all those who believed they possessed it. And so he
encouraged émigrés to return, and ignored directorial legislation
depriving ci-devants of their citizenship. He also knew that the orders
and distinctions particularly associated with nobility were the sort of
‘baubles by which men are governed’. That was why he introduced the
Legion of Honour, with its scarlet ribbons and insignia, in 1802. Finally, in
1808, he set up a full-blown imperial nobility, making special efforts to
recruit authentic nobles from the old order to it. By then, of course, he
had made himself a hereditary monarch, and he believed that no
crowned head could look authentic without a court and a nobility. And
his rule was even more absolute than that of the Bourbons, with
prefects even more omnicompetent than those hated agents of the old
‘despotism’, the intendants.
76

When he fell, moreover, none of this disappeared. Although the line of
hereditary succession would twice be interrupted, with the exception of
the years 1848–52 France would be a monarchy down to 1870, under
either Bourbons or a Bonaparte. Noble status would be ofﬁcially
recognized throughout that time, and in the 1820s émigrés would be
compensated by the state for the lands they had lost in the Revolution.
Prefects continued to represent authority in the country at large, and
even a form of venality of ofﬁces re-emerged among notaries and
other legal functionaries. The Catholic Church, meanwhile, remained
established in its Napoleonic form, its priests paid out of state funds,
until 1905. In 1825, Charles X, last surviving brother of Louis XVI, even
underwent an elaborate coronation, in the traditional setting of Reims
Cathedral, to reconsecrate the bond between his dynasty and God. A
casual observer might be forgiven for concluding that all the destructive
zeal of the Revolution had achieved nothing.

But nothing would be more superﬁcial. Apart from its gaudy trappings,
the monarchy of Napoleon had little in common with that of Louis XVI.
Consciously imperial, it sought to evoke Charlemagne rather than the
Bourbons. There were no built-in vehicles of opposition such as the
parlements or provincial estates. The nobility which the Emperor
created to decorate his monarchical pretensions was much smaller than
its pre-revolutionary namesake, enjoyed no legal privileges, and titles
were not even hereditary without a certain level of wealth. Entry was
by imperial nomination, not by purchase of venal ofﬁce. More old
nobles shunned the chance of joining such a factitious creation than
succumbed to Napoleon’s inducements.
Nor was the restored monarchy of Louis XVIII and Charles X at all like
that of their martyred brother. In many respects, as has often been said,
it was not his throne but Napoleon’s that they inherited. None of the old
regime governmental apparatus was brought back and the Civil Code
77

What it ended

Illusory restorations

remained the backbone of French law. For much of the restoration
period the state was compelled to rely on men who had established
themselves under the Emperor. And if the old nobility was formally
recognized once again, imperial titles were still accepted and the Legion
of Honour maintained. On the other hand, the Charter proclaimed by
Louis XVIII in 1814, which served as the basis of a constitution down to
1848, was imbued with the spirit of 1789. In practice the restoration
monarchy was constitutional, with regular elections to the lower house
of a two-chamber legislature, guarantees of individual and press
freedom, and equality before the law and in taxation. Above all,
perhaps, the Charter, just like Napoleon when his rule began, explicitly
conﬁrmed the revolutionary land settlement. Lands conﬁscated from
the Church and the émigrés and then sold on would not be returned
to their original owners. Indeed, by granting the indemnity of 1825 to
The French Revolution

those who had lost lands, the government of Charles X unwittingly
endorsed the loss. And so successive regimes professing to deplore the
work of the Revolution accepted and guaranteed the massive transfer of
property that it had effected.
This alone was enough to ensure that the Catholic Church restored
under the concordat bore little resemblance to the former Gallican
church. Without lands, endowments, or titles it was dependent on the
state for all its material support apart from the pious donations of the
faithful. All beneﬁced clergy were now state nominees. The old chaotic
and uneven ecclesiastical geography had gone, too, as had the Church’s
exemptions and ﬁscal privileges, and the institutional independence of
regular assemblies of the clergy. Nor were monastic orders allowed to
re-establish themselves – although without endowments there would in
any case have been little prospect of that. Finally, religious toleration
ensured that the ofﬁcial confessional unity of the old regime (already
crumbling, to clerical outrage, by 1789) had also gone for ever.
Although it liked to depict itself as a restoration of throne and altar, the
Bourbon regime that succeeded Napoleon changed little of this. The
78

more extreme, or ultra, supporters of the Bourbons would have liked
not so much to restore the pre-revolutionary Church, as to make it even
stronger than it had been then. They blamed the Revolution on the
undermining of religious authority under the old regime. But their only
success was the passage of an unenforceable act in 1825 stipulating the
death penalty for sacrilege. Meanwhile the pious behaviour of Charles X
at his coronation aroused more ridicule than reverence. The cousin who
succeeded him as Louis-Philippe after the Revolution of 1830 never
made any claims to rule by the grace of God, but merely as the choice of
the French Nation.

A world transformed
Attempts outside France to restore what the French Revolution or its
inﬂuence had smashed were similarly doomed. Here Napoleon made no
contribution. His strongest claim, indeed, to be the instrument of the
order in Italy, Germany, and Spain, annihilating whole states,
introducing the Civil Code and the concordat. Only in Poland, wiped off
the map by partitioning powers in 1795 in the face of French impotence,
and perhaps indifference, did he resurrect an echo of the old order in
the Duchy of Warsaw. After all this, there was no prospect that the
Congress of Vienna which met to establish a post-Napoleonic Europe
could restore anything like the international old regime. In fact, it
redrew frontiers and reallocated sovereigns quite as conﬁdently as he
had, and did nothing to restore any ecclesiastical principalities except
the pope’s own in Italy. It is true that all the great powers of the
1780s had re-emerged stronger than ever; but the ‘concert of Europe’
by which they sought to prevent future conﬂicts on a Napoleonic
scale was entirely new, and owed little beyond a vaguely expressed
desire for ‘balance’ to the ruthless and opportunistic international
order of the eighteenth century. Similarly, the ‘Holy Alliance’ touted
by East European monarchs after 1815 was more redolent of the
sixteenth century than the eighteenth, and was formed to pre-empt
79

What it ended

Revolution is perhaps the way he systematically demolished the old

the disruption of Europe by the forces of any other Godless
revolution.
Even, therefore, when attempts were made to bring back the old regime
or elements of it, these attempts could never be innocent. They were
always infused, not only by awareness that it had once fallen, but also by
convictions about what had brought it down, and by what might have
prevented the disaster. There would be no point in restoring an old
regime that was just as vulnerable as before. So no true restoration was
ever possible, and although monarchies, nobilities, and churches might
all reappear after revolutionary attempts to annihilate them, none of
them really resembled their generic namesakes of before 1789. Despite
appearances, few of the things attacked by the Revolution truly

The French Revolution

survived unscathed.
Quite literally, nothing was any longer sacred. All power, all authority, all
institutions were now provisional, valid only so long as they could be
justiﬁed in terms of rationality and utility. In this sense, the French
Revolution really did represent the triumph of the Enlightenment, and
ushered in the mental world in which we still live.

80

Chapter 5
What it started

The Revolution began as an assertion of national sovereignty.
Nations – not kings, not hereditary elites, not churches – were the
supreme source of authority in human affairs. It was this conviction
which led the National Assembly in 1790 to declare that France would
never make war except in self-defence, and impelled the Convention,
two years later as the new Republic appeared to have survived the
hostile onslaughts of the leagued despots of Germany, to offer
fraternity and help to all peoples seeking to recover their liberty. It
only took a few months for the Convention to recognize the
impossibility of such an open-ended pledge; and the forces unleashed
by the Revolution would be defeated, a generation later, by an alliance
of kings supported by intransigent nobles and vengeful priests who
spurned any thought that nations could be sovereign. Nevertheless a
new principle of political legitimacy had been irrevocably launched,
and within a hundred years of the apparent triumph of reaction in
1815, the sovereignty of nations had achieved acceptance throughout
Europe and the Americas. In the twentieth century it would be
invoked in its turn to expel Europeans from all their overseas
colonies.

81

Totalitarian democracy
What constitutes a nation has remained problematic. Sieyès’ deﬁnition
of 1789, used to lambast the privileges of the nobility, was ‘A body of
associates living under common laws and represented by the same
legislative assembly’. It proved a beginning, but no more – too loose for
those who considered language, traditions, and territory at least as
important. But nations, once self-deﬁned, have seldom been content
over the last two centuries to be governed by authorities not of their
own choosing. The revolutionaries of 1789 assumed that national
sovereignty could only be exercised representatively, but within ten
years Napoleon had begun to show how it could be appropriated to
legitimize dictatorship and even monarchy. Each of the steps he took
between 1799 and 1804 towards making himself a hereditary emperor
The French Revolution

was endorsed by a plebiscite responding to a carefully phrased
question. The results were never in doubt and all were almost certainly
rigged to make them even more emphatic. His nephew Napoleon III
would use the same device to give national legitimacy to his own
seizure of power in 1851 and 1852; and as recently as 1958 the Fifth
Republic was launched by a referendum giving vast powers to General
de Gaulle. The world beyond France had to wait mostly until the
twentieth century for the techniques of plebiscitary or totalitarian
democracy to become widespread; but they were as ﬁrmly rooted in the
great legitimizing principle of 1789 as any of the more liberal ideals also
proclaimed then.

Liberalism
The term ‘liberalism’ was not invented until Napoleon’s power was in
decline. It was ﬁrst used to describe the aspirations of the Cortes of
Cadiz between 1810 and 1813 to establish representative government in
post-Napoleonic Spain. But what the Spanish liberals dreamed of was
based on the political model ﬁrst established in France by the
Constituent Assembly: representative government underpinned by a
82

written constitution guaranteeing a basic range of human rights. These
would constitute the minimum demands of political reformers
throughout the nineteenth century and down to the overthrow of the
last absolute monarchy in Russia in 1917. The essence of liberal beliefs
was to be found in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.
That meant freedom to vote; freedom of thought, belief, and
expression; and freedom from arbitrary imposition or imprisonment.
Liberals believed in the equality embodied in the Declaration, which
meant equality before the law, equality of rights, and equality of
opportunity. They did not, however, believe in equality of property, and
one of the main functions of the rule of law which they consistently
invoked was to secure property owners in their absolute rights.
Beyond that there was scope for wide disagreement. Not until the
twentieth century did more than a small minority accept that women
Revolution the few bold spirits of either sex who made liberal claims on
behalf of women were ridiculed or silenced. One reason why French
women had to wait so long for the political rights they ﬁnally achieved
in 1944 was that the politicians of the Third Republic feared that female
voters would be dominated by their priests: ever since 1793 women had
proved the mainstay of Catholic resistance to revolutionary secularism.
Racial equality left liberals ambivalent too. The ﬁrst stirrings of
anti-slavery sentiment in France coincided with the onset of the
Revolution, but slaves were property, and their labours underpinned
a vast network of wealth and commerce. The dangers of loosening
their bonds seemed vividly demonstrated by the great slave uprising
in Saint-Domingue in 1791. In an attempt to regain control there, the
Convention’s representatives proclaimed the abolition of slavery, and
in February 1794 their action was conﬁrmed in Paris. The deputies
congratulated themselves on being the ﬁrst rulers ever to abolish
slavery – which they were, but only through recognizing a fait accompli.
Napoleon in any case restored it less than ten years later in islands
remaining under French control, and regimes ostensibly more liberal
83

What it started

should enjoy the same liberty and equality as men; and during the

than his maintained it until the revolutionaries of 1848 made it part of
their ﬁrst business to honour the legacy of 1794.
The new Constituent Assembly that made this gesture had been elected
by universal manhood suffrage – a further belated homage to a
principle used to elect the Convention in 1792 but never since. Even then
it had excluded servants and the unemployed. The men of 1789 had
been much more restrictive. They believed that only property owners
had the right to political representation: if all were now citizens, only
those with a minimum level of wealth could be active citizens. The
distinction reﬂected a mistrust of popular participation in public life as
old as history, but which the events of the Revolution did nothing to
dispel. Revolution was born amid riot, intimidation, and bloodshed in
the crisis of 1789, and popular violence or the threat of it had ﬂickered
The French Revolution

throughout the early years before bursting out with appalling carnage
in the September Massacres of 1792. Everybody recognized how much
the vengeful demands of the sansculottes had done to precipitate terror
a year later, so that when, after it ended, the Convention produced the
constitution of 1795 it deliberately set out to exclude even more people
from public life than in 1791. Thereby a pattern was set for half a century,
under which representative regimes would represent only the very rich,
people with something to lose; and even unrepresentative regimes,
like Napoleon’s, would study their interests and seek to rule with their
cooperation.

The People
The problematic paradox was that a revolution which ushered in the
principles of liberalism could not have come about without popular
support. The people of Paris had saved the National Assembly on
14 July, and perhaps in October 1789 as well. What only counterrevolutionaries still dared to call mobs were now manifestations of the
people aroused and in action, and voices could always be found to
justify their excesses. The ferocious Marat, in his newspaper The People’s
84

9. Marat assassinated: Jacques-Louis David’s revolutionary pietà

Friend, built a journalistic career on doing so, and after his assassination
in 1793, was revered (and commemorated in David’s most memorable
painting) as a martyr to the popular cause. By 1792 popular activists
were glorying in being ‘sansculottes’, and after the overthrow of the
monarchy populist style and rhetoric dominated public life for about
three years, polite forms of dress and address were abandoned, and
political rights were equalized (at least among men). An egalitarian
constitution was proclaimed or at any rate promised, vouchsaﬁng free
education and ‘the social guarantee’ of welfare support for the indigent,
the sick, and the disabled. Meanwhile the rich were mulcted in a forced
loan, there was talk of redistributing the property of émigrés and
traitors to poor patriots, and prices of basic commodities were kept low
by the maximum. All these policies were abandoned after the fall of
Robespierre; but almost at once they began to be regarded by
The French Revolution

many as the lost promise of true social equality. Babeuf and his
co-conspirators of 1796 proposed to base their seizure of power on
the never-implemented constitution of 1793. Later, Socialists would look
back to the Year II of the revolutionary calendar to ﬁnd the earliest
‘anticipations’ of their ideals at the moment when the People entered
politics for the ﬁrst time in pursuit of their own interests, rather than as
the tools of more powerful manipulators.

Terror
But here too there was a problematic paradox. The Year II was also
the time of the terror, whose last phase at least looked very like
social revenge in action. Were popular power and terror inseparable?
Drawing on theoretical justiﬁcations framed at the time by orators
such as Robespierre or Saint-Just, some later Socialist or Communist
revolutionaries did not shrink from accepting that only extermination
would defeat the enemies of the people. There could be no true
revolution without terror. And although the nineteenth century
shuddered at the memory of the revolutionary tribunal and the show
trials it conducted, the twentieth would see them echoed under many
86

regimes claiming legitimacy from revolutions. Many later sympathizers
with the Revolution’s broad aspirations were understandably reluctant
to believe that society could only be made more equal through
bloodshed. They, along with liberals who were as concerned by the
threats to property heard in the Year II as the threats to life, saw the
terror as at best a cruel necessity, forced upon the First Republic not
by the inexorable logic of the Revolution but by the force of
‘circumstances’. In a country divided by rashly imposed religious
choices and the feckless behaviour of Louis XVI and his queen, the
fortunes of war dictated extreme measures of national defence as
the distinction between opposition and treason became blurred. But
the Revolution was a warning of what might happen rather than a
prescription of what must.

Left and right
mixed its character, there was more good in the Revolution than bad.
This was the view from the left, itself a way of describing politics which
originated in the Revolution, when proponents of further change
tended in successive assemblies to sit on the left of the president’s chair,
while conservatives congregated on his right. The right, in fact modern
political conservatism, was as much a creation of the French Revolution
as all the things it opposed. The instinctive inertia of the ancien régime
had gone forever: those who sought to preserve governments, power
structures, and social institutions from revolution in the new sense
were obliged to formulate unprecedented rationales and strategies for
doing so.

Conspirators and revolutionaries
The collapse of the old order, and the headlong changes that followed,
took everyone by surprise. In the confusion of the next ﬁve years, with
ever more horriﬁc news of destruction, outrage, and massacre,
87

What it started

All such perceptions were grounded in the conviction that, however

10. The enduring legend: Eugène Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People (1830)

bewildered onlookers cast about for explanations for such a boundless
upheaval. Hostile observers thought it could only be a conspiracy. As a
network of political clubs, the Jacobins, emerged as the vectors of the
revolutionary radicalism, it began to be suspected that these were
none other than the mysterious freemasons who had proliferated so
spectacularly over the eighteenth century. Deistic but tolerant (and
condemned twice for that by the Catholic Church) and glorying in
secrecy while invoking values such as liberty, equality, and benevolence,
masonic aims and ideas seemed in retrospect to be corrosive of all
established values – even though the old elites had ﬂocked to join lodges.
No credible causal link has ever been established between freemasonry
and the French Revolution or indeed the Jacobin clubs, but in 1797 a
book purporting to demonstrate their connection in a plot to subvert
religion, monarchy, and the social hierarchy was a Europe-wide
bestseller. Barruel’s Memoirs to Serve for the History of Jacobinism
suspicion of a movement that before 1789 had alarmed nobody except
a few paranoid priests. So indelibly, indeed, did freemasonry now come
to be associated in certain continental countries with republicanism
and anti-clericalism, that to join a lodge became a gesture of radical
political conviction – which it had never been before the Revolution.
Conservative regimes, right down to the Nazis and their Vichy puppets,
would accordingly continue to view freemasonry with the deepest
suspicion, and would periodically close its networks down.
Nor were such suspicions entirely groundless, in the sense that
throughout the nineteenth century many political radicals had come
to believe that the way to bring about revolution actually was
through secret conspiracies. Before 1789 there was no such thing as a
revolutionary. Nobody believed that an established order could be so
comprehensively overthrown. But once it was shown to be possible, the
history of France in the 1790s became the classic episode of modern
history, whether as inspiration or warning, a model for all sides of what
to do or what to avoid. Not even sympathizers could afford to accept

human agency. And so the 1790s themselves saw secret groups plotting
revolution in many countries of Europe. In Poland and Ireland they
played a signiﬁcant part in bringing about vast and bloody uprisings.
Their defeated leaders who had turned to France for help, men like
Tadeusz Kosciuszko and Wolfe Tone, have been revered ever since as
prophets or martyrs of national independence. And when the
Revolution in France itself began to disappoint its adherents, a genuine
Jacobin plot was hatched – but against the new regime rather than the
old. The ﬁrst attempt in history at communist revolution, Babeuf’s
‘conspiracy of equals’ of 1796 failed miserably; but his co-conspirator
Buonarroti spent the rest of a long life setting up conspiratorial
revolutionary networks, and perpetuated the memory of the ﬁrst one in
The French Revolution

a book of 1828 (Conspiracy for Equality) which inspired three generations
of subversives and became a sacred text of successful Communism after
the Russian Revolution of 1917. Throughout the ﬁrst quarter of the
twentieth century, in fact, when Russia experienced two revolutions,
French precedents became an obsession among Russian intellectuals,
and in 1917 even the leading players brooded constantly on who were
the Jacobins, who the Girondins, and whether a Napoleon was lurking
among them.

Patterns and paradigms
In France itself, meanwhile, recourse to further revolution had been a
standard, and for many people entirely reputable, political option for
much of the nineteenth century. When in 1830 Charles X seemed poised
to abandon even the attenuated parts of the revolutionary legacy
accepted by his brother Louis XVIII as the price for succeeding
Napoleon, he was overthrown by three days of insurgency on the
streets of Paris. His cousin and successor Louis-Philippe ostentatiously
ﬂew the tricolour, and hoped to reconcile the bitterly divided traditions
originating in 1789. He failed, and was driven out in his turn by more
90

popular deﬁance in the revolution of 1848. Another Bonaparte closed
this one off, but his defeat in the Franco-Prusssian War led to the
bloodiest episode since the terror – the Paris Commune of 1871 in which
perhaps 25,000 people died. The very name commune evoked 1792,
and many communards saw themselves as sansculottes reincarnate,
ﬁghting the same enemies as the First Republic – Royalists, Catholics,
duplicitous generals, and the greedy rich. Only the last category derived
much beneﬁt from their defeat, however, and the Third Republic which
emerged from the traumas of the early 1870s would glory in
revolutionary imagery and modestly pursue democratic and anticlerical aspirations ﬁrst articulated in the 1790s. For half a century after
1917, many French intellectuals regarded the Russian Revolution as the
belated fulﬁlment of the promise of their own, and the historiography
of the revolutionary decade was dominated by members of or
sympathizers with the French Communist party. But their grip on the
Soviet empire crumbled in 1989, the hegemonic interpretation of the
bicentennial year was that of the neo-conservative, ex-Communist
François Furet.
Although he saw terror as inherent in the Revolution from its very
beginning, Furet nevertheless saw the revolutionary experience as the
foundation of modern political culture. Americans have the best
grounds for disputing this, with a founding revolution that preceded the
French one by more than a decade. Having helped to make American
independence possible, many French contemporaries certainly found
the transatlantic example inspiring, but nobody thought it could be
transplanted to Europe. By the time that most enduring monument to
eighteenth-century political creativity, the United States constitution,
was ﬁnalized, the French were engaged in their own constitutionmaking and claiming, with some justice, that their revolution was like
no other in history, and owed little except fraternal good feeling to
previous upheavals elsewhere. The Americans themselves were soon
enough bitterly divided about whether the new France was in any sense
91

Revolution began to be challenged from the mid-1950s, and, as the

the same country which had helped them to independence, and
uncertain about how much of its new regime they could admire.
Remote from the older continent, ambivalent about contacts with
it, and speaking what was still a peripheral language, America
was marginalized by the French Revolution until the twentieth
century – even if it owed its westward expansion to the sale by
Napoleon of Louisiana in 1803.

Conservatism, reaction, and religion
Convinced, meanwhile, that what had allowed an old regime of
stability, deference, and order to be overthrown was a lack of vigilance,
European conservatism struck out at the sources of subversion. Before
the 1790s were out, all governments were rapidly expanding their
The French Revolution

repressive resources, with a proliferation of spies and informers and
experiments with regular public police forces. Lists of suspects would be
routinely kept and their movements tracked. Strict censorship would be
imposed on all forms of publishing, and the press, blamed for
disseminating insubordination and free thought both before and during
the Revolution, subjected to the closest supervision. Among the most
efﬁcient of these repressive regimes would be that of Napoleon himself,
who, although a product of the Revolution, sought to ground his appeal
in reassuring property owners that the social threat of Jacobinism had
been stiﬂed. Napoleon also recognized that the original, and still the
deepest, wound inﬂicted on France by the Revolution had been the
quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church; and nothing did more to bring
the Revolution to an end than his concordat with Pius VII. He was
convinced, like all conservative regimes after him throughout the
nineteenth century, that the ﬁrmest support for order and authority lay
in a secure and recognized role for organized religion, in which he saw
nothing more or less than ‘the mystery of the social order’.
Traumatized by the experience of the 1790s, which included the ﬁrst
attempt in history in 1793 to stamp out religious practice entirely, and
92

then the renunciation by the Convention the next year of all religious
afﬁliation (the ﬁrst overt creation in the history of Europe of a secular
state), the Church for its part was only too eager to renew its age-old
alliance with secular powers. The experience proved less than
satisfactory. Within eight years of concluding the concordat, Pius VII
found himself, like his predecessor, a French prisoner, deprived of his
central Italian dominions, and about to undergo four years of relentless
bullying by Napoleon. From imprisonment on St Helena, the former
emperor claimed that he had planned to abolish the papacy outright.
The Bourbons who succeeded him were much friendlier towards the
Church, but they had long given up any idea of returning it to its
position of before 1789. An attempt to renegotiate the concordat
foundered, and the new regime conﬁrmed the loss of Church lands
which Napoleon had insisted the pope accept as a precondition of the
original negotiation. From now on the fortunes of the Church echoed
and when eventually that state became a republic vaunting its descent
from the one which had severed all links between Church and state in
1794, the course was set for a separation which eventually occurred in
1905. Beyond France meanwhile, although the pope received his Italian
territories back in 1814, ecclesiastical rule was not restored anywhere
else in Europe, and Italian nationalists increasingly regarded the papal
states as the main obstacle to unifying the peninsula. Until the downfall
of Napoleon III in 1870, monarchical France was the papacy’s main
supporter; but, increasingly embattled, Pius IX fell back upon powers
that were not of this world. The end of French support, and with it the
absorption of former papal territories into the new kingdom of Italy,
coincided with the promulgation by the Vatican Council of the doctrine
of papal infallibility – never before unambiguously claimed for fear of
the reactions of secular rulers. And what the experience of Church–state
relations had demonstrated since 1790 was that faith was at least as
likely to ﬂourish without the backing of the state as with it. The lesson
was reinforced when the new German empire launched the Kulturkampf
against the Catholic Church in the 1870s. Rome would continue to

anathematize the French Revolution as the origin of modern impiety
and anti-clericalism, a change happily accepted by all those who gloried
in these attitudes. But the traumas of the 1790s also began a process of
slow recognition within the Church that it might be better off
independent of secular authority, free to make its own decisions and
demanding only toleration for its practices and activities. When power
was offered it, as in mid-twentieth-century Spain, or in Ireland, the
clergy still found it hard to resist; but in a world (again traceable to the
French Revolution) where regular political change was normal and to be
expected, the unwisdom of identifying too closely with any regime,
however sympathetic, has become more and more obvious to
thoughtful churchmen.
The Church continued, after all, to pay the penalty of clinging too
The French Revolution

closely to reactionary and repressive regimes throughout the
nineteenth century. As late as the 1920s, the later stages of the Mexican
revolution brought conscious echoes of the dechristianization of 1793,
and the Cristero revolt of devout Indians in support of the embattled
church recalled the Vendée revolt of that same year. The last great
triumph of extreme anti-clericalism, however, struck not so much at the
Catholic Church (or at least not until it reached Poland, Czechoslovakia,
and Hungary after 1945) as the Russian Orthodox. By 1922, Lenin had
‘reached the ﬁrm conclusion that we must now instigate a decisive and
merciless battle against the clergy, we must suppress their opposition
with so much cruelty that they will not forget it for several decades.
The more . . . we succeed in shooting for this reason, the better’. Like
several of the more zealous dechristianizers of 1793, Stalin had trained
before the Revolution as a priest, and the Soviet Union under his
rule was ofﬁcially committed to atheism and the eradication of
‘superstition’. Most churches were closed, many demolished, and
devotion was largely kept alive (as in France in the 1790s) by peasant
women. These policies were maintained, although less ruthlessly,
after his death; and yet the Church re-emerged as the Soviet Union
collapsed. Its East European satellite regimes, meanwhile, knew better
94

than to confront the Catholic Church too ﬁercely. The emergence of a
pope from Poland in 1978 might be seen, in retrospect, as a sign of the
Church’s recovering conﬁdence at the moment when an ideology of
extreme secularism ﬁrst formulated almost two centuries earlier was
beginning to crumble.

Rationalization
The revolutionary critique of religion, even before it became an all-out
attack, was part of the wider commitment of the men of 1789 to
promoting rationality in human affairs. The collapse of the old regime,
they thought, presented them with an opportunity to take control of
their circumstances and remould them according to a conscious plan or
set of principles. Nobody before had ever had such an extraordinary
chance. When their armies and Napoleon’s in turn overthrew other old
same chance. The keynote of all the new arrangements and institutions
which now appeared was rationality and uniformity. Administrative
maps and boundaries were redrawn, divisions equalized, anomalies of
all sorts eliminated. The departments into which France was then
divided remained unmodiﬁed until the twentieth century. Uniformity of
means of exchange and communication was also introduced – currency,
weights and measures, and language; underpinned by a centralized and
carefully regulated system of education, and a simple, concise code of
laws. Some of these things were only sketched out or barely begun in
the 1790s; but the drive and singleness of purpose of Napoleon ﬁxed
most of them ﬁrmly in place and established them all as goals to be
pursued by successive regimes. This was how modern states organized
themselves. It is true that, under the inexorable pressure of interstate
competition, moves in this direction had already been underway in a
number of countries before 1789: but they were bitterly contentious,
and it was contention over just such moves that brought down the
French old regime. The Revolution swept the institutions and forces of
resistance aside, both in France and wherever else French power

What it started

regimes, they gave their subjects – forced upon them, indeed – the

reached. In so doing, it offered an object lesson to all regimes of how
easy modernization could be, given determination.
Or so it seemed. In reality, the victories of the French Revolution had
been far from easy. They had only been secured though paranoid
savagery at home and military ruthlessness abroad. To the 16,000
ofﬁcial victims of the terror should be added perhaps 150,000 more
who perished in the ﬁghting and reprisals of 1793–4. The devastated
Vendée, in fact, has been identiﬁed by some of its most recent historians
as the ﬁrst modern attempt at genocide. The wars against old regime
Europe between 1792 and 1815 cost the lives of well over 5 million
Europeans (1.4 million of them French) – a slaughter as great, although
over a longer period, as that of the war of 1914–18. Such costs were
overlooked, or brushed aside, by later observers inspired by the
The French Revolution

ambitions and achievements of the revolutionaries. The corollary was
that when such enthusiasts triumphed, as in twentieth-century Russia
or China, the carnage was repeated. Nor have the victories achieved at
such cost endured.

A limited legacy
The legacy of the French Revolution to the nineteenth century, we have
seen in this chapter, was momentous, but always partial and often
paradoxical. The regimes of revolutionary Communism established in
the twentieth century have not outlasted it in Europe, and those still
surviving beyond are transforming themselves in ways which would
have outraged their founding fathers. What has defeated the
revolutionary impulse in the long term is the persistence of cultural
diversity. Rationalizing ideologies imposed by state power, and the
intellectuals and administrators who have placed such faith in them
since 1789, have never succeeded in effacing the importance of less
rational sources of identity in habits, traditions, religious beliefs,
regional and local loyalties, or distinct languages. Perhaps the most
ambitious of all the Revolution’s rationalizations was the attempt to
96

restart time itself from the founding of the republic in September 1792.
The very months were rescheduled and renamed, and seven-day weeks
replaced by ten-day ‘decades’. It never caught on, and the revolutionary
calendar was ofﬁcially abandoned by Napoleon at the end of the year
XIV (1806). It was a portent of many other failures of reason in the face
of human resistance or indifference. And with the collapse since the
mid-1980s of most of the world’s regimes of Communist universalism,
these forces have re-emerged with renewed vigour. Even in countries
where Communism never triumphed in the twentieth century,
including France, decentralization and devolution, acknowledgement
of linguistic diversity, and abandonment by the state of obligations too
readily assumed or acquired, marked the last two decades of the
twentieth century. As the bicentenary of 1989 recedes, what was
intended as a celebration of the enduring values launched by the
Revolution begins to seem more like their funeral.
What it started

97

Chapter 6
Where it stands

‘The whole business now seems over’, wrote the English observer
Arthur Young in Paris on 27 June 1789, ‘and the revolution complete.’
People would repeatedly make the same observation, usually more in
hope than conviction, over the next ten years until Napoleon ofﬁcially
proclaimed the end of the Revolution in December 1799. Even then all
he meant was the end of a series of spectacular events in France; he was
to continue to export them for another sixteen years. Besides, the
Revolution was not simply a meaningless sequence of upheavals. These
conﬂicts were about principles and ideas which continued to clash
throughout the nineteenth century, and would be reinvigorated by the
triumphs of Marxist Communism in the twentieth. Thus it still seemed
outrageous to many French intellectuals when, in 1978, the historian
François Furet proclaimed, at the start of a celebrated essay, that ‘The
French Revolution is ﬁnished’ (terminée).

A historical challenge
What he meant was that the Revolution was now, or ought to be, a
subject for historical enquiry as detached and dispassionate as that of
medievalists studying (his example) the Merovingian kings. Whereas
the history of the Revolution as it has been written in France for much
of the twentieth century had been more a matter of commemoration
than scholarly analysis, its legitimacy monopolized by a succession of
98

Communists or fellow-travellers entrenched in the university hierarchy.
Furet’s attack was suffused with personal history. Though a Sorbonne
graduate, he had always despised the university world, and had built a
career in the rival Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes (later EHESS). A
Communist in youth, like so many others he was disillusioned by the
Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, and renounced the party. And when
he and a fellow apostate, Denis Richet, wrote a new history of the
Revolution in 1965, they were unanimously denounced by leading
specialists in the subject as intruders, not qualiﬁed in the subject, who,
in offering an interpretation suggesting that it had ‘skidded off course’,
had traduced the Revolution’s essential unity of purpose and direction.
By 1978 Furet had abandoned this view, but not the enmities it had
aroused. For the rest of his life (he died in 1997), he pressed home
his attack, particularly during the debates of the bicentenary.
As that year came to an end, he cheerfully proclaimed that he had
Where it stands

won.

The classic interpretation
What had he defeated? He called it the ‘Jacobino-Marxist Vulgate’. His
opponents called it the ‘classic’ interpretation of the Revolution. Its
basis was (and is, since despite Furet’s triumphalism it retains many
adherents) the conviction that the Revolution was a force for progress.
The fruit and vindication of the Enlightenment, it set out to emancipate
not just the French, but humanity as a whole, from the grip of
superstition, prejudice, routine, and unjustiﬁable social inequities by
resolute and democratic political action. This was the ‘Jacobin’ bedrock,
differing little from the professions of countless clubbists in the 1790s.
As a historical interpretation, it built on the work of nineteenth-century
custodians of revolutionary traditions, most famously perhaps Jules
Michelet, that apocalyptic idolizer of ‘The People’. Conﬁdent and
complacent, the Jacobin perspective was disturbed only by the terror,
which it did not seek to defend except as a cruel necessity and a reﬂex of
national defence.
99

Around the turn of the twentieth century, this historiographical
Jacobinism began to acquire a new political overlay. From 1898 the great
left-wing politician Jean Jaurès began to produce a Socialist History of the
French Revolution which emphasized its economic and social dimensions
and introduced an element of Marxist analysis. Marx himself had written
little directly on the Revolution, but it was easy enough to ﬁt a
movement which had begun with an attack on nobles and feudalism
into a theory of history that emphasized class struggle and the conﬂict
between capitalism and feudalism. The French Revolution from this
viewpoint was the key moment in modern history, when the capitalist
bourgeoisie overthrew the old feudal nobility. The fundamental
questions about it were therefore economic and social. At the very
moment when Jaurès was writing, a ﬁerce young professional historian,
Albert Mathiez, was beginning a lifelong campaign to rehabilitate
The French Revolution

Robespierre, under whose terroristic rule clear ‘anticipations’ of later
socialist ideals had appeared. Mathiez set out to stamp his own
viewpoint on the entire historiography of the Revolution, and his native
vigour was redoubled from 1917 by the example and inspiration of the
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, which seemed to revive the lost promise
of 1794. Robespierre’s Republic of Virtue would live again in Lenin’s
Soviet Union. Mathiez only belonged brieﬂy to the Communist Party,
but he established a parallel historical party of his own in the form of a
‘Society of Robespierrist Studies’. Its journal, the Annales Historiques de
la Révolution française, is still the main French-language periodical
devoted to the Revolution. Apart from the years of Vichy, when it was
silenced, from the death of Mathiez in 1932 until the advent of Furet this
society and its members dominated teaching and writing about the
Revolution in France, and its successive leading ﬁgures occupied the
chair of the History of the Revolution at the Sorbonne. When Furet
launched his polemics, the incumbent of this apostolic succession was
the lifelong Communist Albert Soboul (d.1982), against whose
convictions the waters of what he naturally called ‘revisionism’ broke in
vain.

100

Revisionism
But revisionism had not begun with Furet. It originated in the Englishspeaking world in the 1950s – in England with Alfred Cobban, in the USA
with George V. Taylor. Although many of the great minds of nineteenthcentury anglophone culture had been fascinated by the French
Revolution and Napoleon, interest lapsed during the ﬁrst half of the
twentieth century. The handful of historians still attracted to the subject
worked little in France and achieved almost no recognition there. After
the Second World War, however, as Western democracy appeared
threatened by Marxists both domestic and foreign, it seemed urgent to
rescue the great episodes of modern history from tendentious
distortions. Both Cobban and Taylor chose to confront what they called
the French ‘orthodoxies’ head-on. It was a myth, Cobban claimed, that
the revolutionaries of 1789 were the spokesmen of capitalism; the
landowners. In any case, Taylor argued, most pre-revolutionary wealth
was non-capitalist, and such capitalism as there was had no interest in
the destruction of the old order. That destruction, indeed, so far from
sweeping away the obstacles holding back a thrusting capitalist
bourgeoisie, proved an economic disaster and drove everyone with
money to invest in the security of land. Taking their cue from the vast
range of questions raised by these critiques, throughout the 1960s and
1970s a new generation of scholars from English-speaking countries
invaded the French archives to test the new hypotheses. By the 1980s
they had largely demolished the empirical basis and the intellectual
coherence of the ‘classic’ interpretation of the Revolution’s origins.
Initially the French maintained their traditional disdain for the ‘AngloSaxons’, dismissing Taylor and Cobban as cold warriors who had read
too much Burke and wished only to disparage the Revolution as a
continuing threat to the hegemony of the Western bourgeoisie. But
when Furet and Richet challenged the classic interpretation from within
the introverted world of French culture, the Robespierrists were forced
101

Where it stands

deputies who destroyed the ancien régime were ofﬁce-holders and

onto the defensive. Furet, who had no problems with the English
language, had by the early 1970s begun to incorporate the ﬁndings and
arguments of the foreigners into his own interpretations; as well as
those of a compatriot long neglected in France but always taken
seriously by English speakers, Alexis de Tocqueville (d. 1859). Tocqueville
saw the Revolution as the advent of democracy and equality but not of
liberty. Napoleon and his nephew, whom this aristocrat of old stock
hated, had shown how dictatorship could be established with
democratic support, since the Revolution had swept away all the
institutions which, in impeding the relentless growth of state power,
had kept the spirit of liberty alive. These insights persuaded Furet that
the Revolution had not after all skidded off course into terror. The
potential for terror had been inherent right from the start, from the
moment when national sovereignty was proclaimed and no recognition
The French Revolution

given to the legitimacy of conﬂicting interests within the national
community. For all its libertarian rhetoric, the Revolution had no more
been disposed to tolerate opposition than the old monarchy, and the
origins of modern totalitarianism would be found in the years between
1789 and 1794.

Post-revisionism
This was more than revisionism. The approach of Cobban, Taylor, and
those who came after them has largely been empirical, undermining the
sweeping social and economic claims of the classic interpretation with
new evidence, but seldom seeking to establish new grand overviews.
The most they claimed was that the Revolution could be more
convincingly explained in terms of politics, contingency, and perhaps
even accident. This is largely the approach adopted in earlier chapters of
this book. Such suggestions did not satisfy bolder minds. As Furet
began to depict a Revolution in the grip of attitudes and convictions
which propelled it inevitably towards terror, others, mostly in America,
sought wider explanations for revolutionary behaviour in cultural terms.
They saw a number of ‘discourses’ emerging from the political conﬂict
102

between 1770 and 1789, which laid the foundation for much of the
uncompromising language and arguments of the revolutionaries.
Borrowing from the speculations of the German left-wing philosopher
Jürgen Habermas, they argued that in the generation before the
Revolution public opinion escaped from the king’s control, and that in
the process respect and reverence for the monarchy ebbed away. Furet
found these interpretative trends even more congenial than those of
early revisionism, and spent increasing amounts of time in America
and at conferences abroad, where yet another generation of young
scholars committed to the cultural approach treated the triumphs
of revisionism as yesterday’s battles. By 1987, these trends were
crystallizing into a new orthodoxy, and were being labelled as
post-revisionism.

The bicentenary
coherent and comprehensible. By contrast, the ‘linguistic turn’ of
post-revisionism, increasingly inﬂuenced by philosophers and literary
theorists, produced much abstruse material that could barely be
understood outside specialist circles. When, therefore, the Socialist
president of France decreed, some years in advance, that the
revolutionary bicentenary of 1989 must be celebrated, he entrusted the
academic side of the festivities to the still well-entrenched defenders of
what Soboul had called, just before he died, ‘our good old orthodoxy’.
Soboul’s successor at the Sorbonne, Michel Vovelle, was given a
worldwide mission of coordinating academic commemoration. He
worked so hard at it that eventually doctors instructed him to stop.
But the learned bicentenary proved just as unmanageable as the more
public one. While both Vovelle and Furet toured colloquia in every
continent, they never appeared together on the same platform, and
Furet and his cohorts boycotted the biggest conference of the year
organized by Vovelle in Paris. This was scarcely the attitude of scholarly
detachment for which Furet had seemed to be calling in 1978. As a
103

Whatever might be said against the classic interpretation, it was at least

11. Scholarly overload: The reaction of reviewers to the bicentenary
(Daily Telegraph, 3 June 1989)

subject arousing sectarian passions, the Revolution was clearly far from
ﬁnished, even for those claiming it was.
The bicentenary, in fact, released a torrent of vituperative publishing,
most of it denouncing one aspect or another of the Revolution and its
legacy. Particularly vocal in France were defenders of the Vendée rebels,
the most persistent contemporary French enemies of the Revolution,
and in consequence victims of the most savage repression. The heroism
of devout peasant guerillas, long derided as superstitious fanatics, was
now lovingly chronicled. Catholic clergy reminded their ﬂocks of when
modern impiety had begun. In the English-speaking world, meanwhile,
while hundreds of learned gatherings picked over the debris of a
generation of scholarly clashes, and publishers and the media felt
obliged to mark the bicentenary in one way or another, the sensation of
the year was the publication of Simon Schama’s Citizens, a vast
entirely in the interests of telling a colourful and lurid story. The overall
message was the folly of undertaking revolutions (one fortunately lost
on the East Europeans who were at that moment defying Soviet satellite
regimes). Yet there was an intellectual stance behind Schama’s
Dickensian narrative, and it was basically the same as Furet’s. The terror,
declared the most famous sentence in the book, was merely 1789 with a
higher body count; and ‘violence . . . was not just an unfortunate side
effect . . . it was the Revolution’s source of collective energy. It was what
made the Revolution revolutionary’. Signiﬁcantly, Schama’s tale ended
abruptly in 1794 with the fall of Robespierre and the end of the terror.
One of the favourite mantras of the Revolution’s classic interpreters was
taken from Georges Clemenceau, the statesman of the Third Republic
who gloried in the achievements of the First. The Revolution, he
declared, was a bloc. It had to be accepted in its totality, terror and all. It
could not be disaggregated. Revisionism, with its emphasis on the
contingent, the accidental, and the reality of choices facing those
involved, suggested otherwise – as had the young Furet when he and

Richet spoke of the Revolution skidding off course. Only by approaching
events as contemporaries had to, without an awareness of horrors to
come, could regicide, dechristianization, and the guillotine be
prevented from throwing their shadows over what preceded them, as
they did over everything that followed. Post-revisionists, however,
turned against this approach. In emphasizing the cultural constraints
that determined what history’s actors could or could not think or do,
they opened the way to a determinism not unlike that of the economic
and social factors emphasized by the classic historians in their
Marxist-inspired heyday. And in insisting that terror was inherent in
the Revolution from the start, Furet made it the central issue by which
to judge the movement’s entire signiﬁcance. For post-revisionists of all
stamps, in fact, the Revolution was as much a bloc as it was for those

The French Revolution

they claimed to have vanquished.
It was, of course, a different sort of bloc. And while the post-revisionist
emphasis on the centrality of terror encouraged blanket denunciations
not only of the Revolution but also of the very attempt to
commemorate it, there were also plenty of celebrations throughout
France, as Mitterrand intended, of two hundred years of human rights.
Vovelle, for his part, while reiterating his commitment to left-wing
values traceable back to Jacobinism, refused to accept that there had
been any sort of contest with Furet, observing meekly that scholarly
enquiry was open to all viewpoints. But, apart from a few hard-line
Communists, the adherents of the once-hegemonic classic tradition
emerged from the bicentenary chastened. In the 1990s, the Annales
Historiques de la Révolution began gingerly to open its pages to nonmembers of the Robespierrist studies circle, and to review their books
for purposes other than denunciation. The chair of Mathiez, Soboul, and
Vovelle is now occupied by a historian of the Vendée. And although
since the death of Furet new sympathetic analyses of Jacobinism have
begun to appear, they have been anxious to deny that terror was part of
its mainstream. The heaviest blows, however, were not delivered by
scholarly revisionists or post-revisionists. They came from the
106

spectacular collapse of Soviet Communism, and the repressive attempts
of its Chinese variant, just a few weeks before 14 July 1989, to shore up
its authority against students calling for liberty and singing the
Marseillaise.

The end of a dream?
Awareness of the full repressive record of Soviet Communism had been
growing at least since Krushchev had begun to denounce Stalin in 1956.
But so long as the Soviet Union continued apparently ﬂourishing and
powerful, it could be argued that its Marxist ideology worked and that
its bloody past had been a worthwhile price to pay to secure popular
democracy. Similar arguments had been used to justify terror in 1793–4,
and by later pro-Jacobin historians. When the rule of Gorbachev
revealed the whole Soviet ediﬁce to be unviable, and incapable of
A regime invested for seventy years with all the hopes and dreams
repeatedly frustrated since the fall of Robespierre had proved scarcely
more successful, and at far heavier human cost, than the prototype
which it and its friends held in reverence. The Chinese, whose historical
loyalties were similar, had no answer to their own domestic critics other
than to shoot or imprison them. If such regimes were the true heirs of
the French Revolution, then Tocqueville and Furet were right in their
perception that its signiﬁcance lay not in the enhancement of liberty but
in the promotion of state power. Faith in the benevolent potential of a
rationalizing state was the ﬁrst, and perhaps the last, illusion of the
Enlightenment; and in this sense the French Revolution, and all the
others that followed over two hundred years, were its authentic heirs.
The illusion died whilst historians in the West squabbled about how, or
even whether, to mark the Revolution’s second centenary.
But of course totalitarian peoples’ democracy was not the only legacy of
ways of thinking that ﬁrst triumphed in the 1790s. François Mitterrand’s
decision to celebrate the rights of man at the bicentenary was more

than a doomed attempt to dissociate the memory of the Revolution
from the terror. It was also a recognition that the ideology of human
rights was, if anything, more important than it had ever been. Regimes
of tyranny and massacre have no monopoly in the heritage of the
Revolution. Citizens of modern constitutional democracies whose civil
and political rights are guaranteed, and whose life chances are equal
before the law, can ﬁnd much in it to celebrate. The ambition of the
French Revolution was so comprehensive that almost anyone living
since can ﬁnd something there to admire as well as to deplore. Nor are
all the battles it launched yet over. If the collapse of Communism can be
seen as defeat for Jacobins, the European Union looks very like a
Girondin project to bring the liberal beneﬁts of 1789 to Europe as a
whole. In turn, this aspiration meets most resistance from national
reﬂexes ﬁrst fully aroused by the challenges emanating from

revolutionary France. ‘The barest enumeration of some of the principal
consequences of 1789’, wrote an eminent literary critic in 1987, even
before the full symbolic signiﬁcance of the bicentennial year had
emerged,
enforce the realisation that the world as we know it today . . . is the
composite of reﬂexes, political assumptions and structures, rhetorical
postulates, bred by the French Revolution. More than arguably, for it
entails subsequent, so often mimetic revolutionary movements and
struggles across the rest of the planet, the French Revolution is the
pivotal historical-social date after that of the foundation of Christianity . . . Time itself, the cycle of lived history, was deemed to have
begun a second time . . . 1789 continues to be now.
G. Steiner, ‘Aspects of Counter-Revolution’, in G. Best (ed.)
The Permanent Revolution

The last word, however, should perhaps be left to the author with whom
this book began. ‘That, my dear Algy’, says Ernest Worthing, ‘is the
whole truth pure and simple.’ ‘The truth’, his friend replies, ‘is rarely
pure and never simple.’
