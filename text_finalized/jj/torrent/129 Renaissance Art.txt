Acknowledgements

For their help and support while planning and writing this book, I
would like to thank my fellow ‘students’ at Christ Church, Oxford,
and especially my colleagues in the Department of History of
Art at the University of Oxford: Martin Kemp, Marius Kwint,
Gavin Parkinson, Katerina Reed-Tsocha, Linda Whiteley, Vicky Brown,
Nicola Henderson, and Laura Iliffe. Staff and colleagues in the Modern
History Faculty and the Sackler Library in Oxford have also been
invaluable in completing this volume, as have my editors at Oxford
University Press, Marsha Filion and Katharine Reeve, and my copy
editor, Alyson Lacewing. My graduate students at Oxford have, perhaps
unwittingly, served as guinea pigs on which to test some of the ideas
presented here, for which I am very grateful.
My wise and wonderful parents, R. Stanley and Ursula Gustorf Johnson,
have always been my greatest champions. In the case of the present
book, they were also the ﬁrst to read the manuscript and very kindly
provided a key illustration, both reﬂections of their own deep
appreciation and understanding of Renaissance art. My family and
friends, both near and far, have given me much enthusiastic support
during the preparation of this book. I am especially thankful to:
Gregoire, Kristine, and Kristof Johnson; Doris and Hans Schmeling;
Peter, Judy, Sarah, and Jane Martin; and Tania String. Last but certainly
not least, my amazing husband, Chris Martin, was absolutely crucial
to my completing this volume, not only by providing much love and

encouragement, but also by patiently listening to my latest half-baked
ideas for the text and making sure that a steady supply of high-energy
snacks was available while it was actually being written. It is to him,
a true Renaissance man for the 21st century, that I dedicate this little
book con tantissimo amore.

Chapter 1
Introduction: whose
Renaissance? whose art?

‘Art’ in the Renaissance
The year is 1768. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, at the time a
mere law student, but soon to become Germany’s most famous
poet-philosopher, steps into Dresden’s new art museum for the ﬁrst
time and describes the scene:
. . . the profound silence that reigned, created a solemn and unique
impression, akin to the emotion experienced upon entering a House
of God, and it deepened as one looked at the ornaments on
exhibition which, as much as the temple that housed them, were
objects of adoration in that place consecrated to the holy ends
of art.

One of the works he would have admired was Raphael’s Sistine
Madonna (Figure 1), acquired in 1754 by Dresden’s ruler, Augustus
III of Saxony, but familiar to us today from countless Christmas
cards, posters, and knick-knacks featuring the painting’s cherubic
pair of plump child-angels. For Goethe, seeing such works in
the hushed atmosphere of Dresden’s picture gallery was a quasireligious experience in which paintings were worshipped as the
aesthetic relics of semi-divine artistic geniuses. Still today, when
we gaze reverentially at paintings, sculptures, and drawings by
Renaissance masters such as Raphael displayed in the temple-like
1

1. Raphael Sanzio, The Sistine Madonna, oil on canvas, c. 1512–14

surroundings of art museums, we continue to treat them like
objects worthy of aesthetic worship and almost mystical visual
contemplation.
The Sistine Madonna’s original 16th-century beholders,
however, did not see religion merely as a kind of metaphor for the
appreciation of art, but rather encountered such paintings within
the context of actual religious rituals. For the Sistine Madonna was
not really a work of art as Goethe or, indeed, any of us today would
understand the term. Instead, it was ﬁrst and foremost a devotional
image with very speciﬁc ritual purposes. It was, in short, an
altarpiece.

3

Introduction: whose Renaissance? whose art?

We will be considering the altarpiece as a genre or type of art
in the second chapter. For the moment, however, it is crucial to
understand that, no matter how familiar such works may seem to
our eyes, we should not simply assume that we can ‘see’ them in
the same way that their Renaissance beholders did. Instead, the
concept of ‘Art’ itself must be contextualized through the ‘period
eye’ of 15th- and 16th-century beholders. As we shall see, many of
the paintings, sculptures, and drawings by Renaissance artists now
displayed in museums or highlighted in tourist guidebooks as
artistic masterpieces would originally have been evaluated not
only or even primarily in aesthetic terms, but rather viewed as
functional objects with carefully selected iconographies produced
for deﬁned sacred or secular purposes that had evolved from
venerable and often still-ongoing traditions. At the same time,
it is precisely during the Renaissance that the modern concept
of ‘Art’ (with a capital ‘A’) ﬁrst began to emerge, together with
related notions about the status of the artist as creative genius,
the importance of originality (rather than craftsmanship) in
assessing the merit of art objects, and the signiﬁcance of using
aesthetic criteria to judge works of art – subjects that we will
consider brieﬂy below and, at greater length, in several of the
following chapters.

Reconsidering the Renaissance

Renaissance Art

However, it is not only the term ‘Art’ that we need to consider
carefully. In fact, the ﬁrst part of this volume’s title, ‘Renaissance’,
is also more complex than may appear at ﬁrst glance. The word
literally means ‘rebirth’, but has come to be associated more
generally with revival and innovation, often in a variety of ﬁelds of
endeavour. So, for example, we speak of the ‘Harlem Renaissance’
when describing the new ﬂourishing of art, music, dance, and
literature in New York City’s African-American community in the
1920s, while everyone from Benjamin Franklin to Apple’s Steve
Jobs has been called a ‘Renaissance man’ thanks to having
multi-faceted interests and innovative ideas.
But if we want to use the concept historically, rather than
metaphorically, we need to ask when and how it was ﬁrst deployed.
Most scholars agree that the notion, if not the word itself, can be
traced back to 14th-century Italy and the rise of humanism. In this
period, writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio began to articulate a
longing for the Classical world of ancient Greece and Rome, with
particular emphasis on reviving the languages and intellectual
traditions of these long-dead civilizations. In the mid-16th century,
the painter and art historian Giorgio Vasari used the Italian version
of the word ‘Renaissance’, rinascita, to refer explicitly to the revival
not only of the artistic standards and literary prototypes of the
Classical age, but also to distinguish the art of the present from
that of the more recent Medieval past. For Vasari, in other words,
‘rebirth’ was not only about reviving the visual culture of ancient
Greece and Rome, but also about differentiating Renaissance art
from its supposedly ‘dark’ and dreary immediate predecessors. In
fact, it is this sense of historical self-awareness, of seeing oneself
and the culture of one’s own time as somehow different and distinct
from that of the past, both near and distant, that is perhaps the
most important hallmark of the humanist Renaissance.
Since the mid-19th century, historians such as Jacob Burckhardt
4

But was the Renaissance only about developing a new sense of
individuality and displaying a conscious preference for revival,
change, and progress? And did everyone throughout Europe really
have a ‘Renaissance’, either literally or metaphorically? Despite the
best efforts of Burckhardt and his many followers to convince us
otherwise, the answer to both questions is ‘no’. In the case of a small
band of elite humanist scholars, patrons, writers, and artists
working ﬁrst in Italy in the 14th century and then, in the 15th and
16th centuries (the time span that will be the focus of this book),
throughout Europe, there clearly was an explicit desire to turn to
the Classical past for inspiration in creating a new intellectual,
artistic, and literary culture in the present. But for by far the vast
majority of people living in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Britain,
and the Low Countries in this period, life went on pretty much as
before on most fronts. It would thus be difﬁcult to speak of a
‘Renaissance’ occurring in any signiﬁcant sense in the lives, beliefs,
and experiences of, say, an Italian silk weaver, an English farmer’s
wife, or a French blacksmith.
5

Introduction: whose Renaissance? whose art?

have popularized the notion of the Renaissance as a distinct and
highly self-aware historical period that was the direct precursor of
our present-day (and even more self-aware) modern world. It was
also Burckhardt, in his inﬂuential book on The Civilization of the
Renaissance in Italy (1860), who ﬁrst made explicit the idea of the
Renaissance as a period in which multi-talented ‘universal men’
consciously sought to use the Classical past as an inspirational
model for creating a new age of enlightenment in ﬁelds as diverse as
science, art, and politics, a subject we will be considering again in
Chapter 4 when we explore the role played by the close observation
of nature and the use of antique models in Renaissance artistic
practices. The Burckhardtian notion of the ideal ‘Renaissance man’
as an uomo universale will also re-emerge in the ﬁfth chapter, when
we explore the rise of individual portraiture as a genre in this
period, while the status of and role played by Renaissance
women in the realm of the visual arts will be considered in the
sixth chapter.

Renaissance Art

The great exception was religion. Until the early 16th century,
the religious life of European men and women was essentially a
continuation of long-standing Medieval rituals and traditions, with
regional variations and shifts of emphasis but generally remaining
fairly constant over several centuries. This was true for the elite
as well as for those of less exalted social and economic status.
But in the early 16th century, the challenges of the Protestant
Reformation, led by charismatic ﬁgures such as Martin Luther,
signalled a radical break in the religious life and outlook of
European society at all levels. One can thus see ‘Renaissance art’
or ‘Renaissance literature’ as consciously encouraging new,
progressive, and often Classically inspired styles and subjects
associated with elite patrons and the artists and writers they
favoured, especially in the secular realm. But it would be
anachronistic to speak of ‘Renaissance religion’ given the general
continuity with the immediate past that existed in this area
until the early 16th century. Instead, it would probably make
more sense to mark a division between ‘late Medieval’ and
‘post-Reformation’ or ‘Early Modern’ culture when considering the
question of religion – with ‘Early Modern’ being a term used by
academics in recent decades to indicate a period stretching from
approximately the 16th to the 18th centuries, and one that is
perhaps less heavily burdened by the associations and assumptions
that have become attached to the word ‘Renaissance’ since
Burckhardt’s day.

Art, artists, and patrons
The tensions between continuity and change in this period can be
seen in the many different types of images and objects produced in
15th- and 16th-century Europe. While many of these items would
not look out of place in a present-day art museum or, indeed, in the
Dresden picture gallery visited by Goethe in the later 18th century,
it is important to keep in mind that none was originally made for
such surroundings. Indeed, the great majority would not have been
viewed as ‘works of art’ in the ﬁrst place, at least not in the modern
6

sense of the phrase. That is, they would not have been understood as
somehow making concrete an individual artist’s personal beliefs,
emotions, and experiences. Instead, it was the taste, desires, and
needs of the patron who commissioned them that were meant to be
expressed in such objects.

Similarly, the majority of objects and images produced in the
Renaissance would not have been assessed primarily as works of
art in aesthetic terms, that is, by considering their style and
composition, as well as how they ﬁt into a grand art historical
narrative organized chronologically around the notion of formal
artistic ‘progress’ and ‘development’. Such criteria, however, are
precisely what have been used when deciding how to display most
7

Introduction: whose Renaissance? whose art?

Likewise, artists were not social outcasts and intellectual rebels,
starving in garrets due to conventional society’s inability to
appreciate their forward-thinking vision and genius. Rather, the
successful Renaissance artist was usually a member of an often
rather conservative trade group known as a guild or, in the later
16th century, was perhaps afﬁliated with a state-approved art
academy, both of which guaranteed the patron a certain level of
competence – as well as guaranteeing the artist a reasonable stream
of income. In order to win commissions from wealthy patrons in the
ﬁrst place – patrons who included individuals ranging from popes
and princes to patricians and well-to-do citizens, as well as larger
organizations such as town councils, guilds, confraternities, and
religious orders – artists had to conform to the social, political, and
devotional expectations of their paymasters. Although, as we shall
see in the ﬁnal chapter, the status of a small number of ‘superstars’
such as Michelangelo Buonarroti and Albrecht Dürer did allow
a new notion of the artist as a visionary and sometimes even
eccentric genius to begin to emerge in this period, the vast majority
of Renaissance artists were successful precisely because they were
considered to be sufﬁciently steady, skilful, and reliable to be
entrusted with executing a particular commission exactly as the
patron had intended.

Renaissance Art

Renaissance paintings, sculptures, and drawings in present-day
museums, where the rooms are arranged chronologically by artistic
‘school’ and the wall labels list only the artist’s name, the date, and
the title of the work, usually to the exclusion of any more detailed
contextual information. As was already the case in Goethe’s day, the
museum itself is silent and devoid of unnecessary distractions, so as
to enhance our ability to worship the art object on its own aesthetic
terms, to appreciate ‘art for art’s sake’, as the 19th-century
bohemian intellectual Théophile Gautier put it.
But in the Renaissance, the situation was very different. Although
over the course of the 16th century, a small number of patrons and
collectors did begin to acquire and display paintings, statues, and
drawings at least in part based on aesthetic criteria that we would
recognize today, such as the reputation of the artist or the
originality and beauty of the work on its own terms, by far the
largest number of objects and images fulﬁlled very different
functions in this period. For instance, altarpieces were part of the
standard ‘equipment’ used for performing the religious rituals
associated with the Mass, while drawings were used primarily as
means to an end in the process of producing a ﬁnished image,
rather than preserved as spontaneous traces of a great artist’s style
or ‘hand’. As we shall see in Chapter 3, in the case of frescos,
narrative altarpieces, and illuminated manuscripts, artistic skill was
deployed to help readers and beholders interpret historical events
and make sacred and secular texts generally more memorable.
Statues displayed in public spaces, such as those we will discuss in
the eighth chapter, were used to glorify the power and potency of
both Church and State, while objects such as decorated furnishings,
ceramics, tapestries, and metalwork, which we will consider in the
seventh chapter, were actively used in the everyday domestic life of
wealthy households.
Of course, this does not mean that Renaissance men and women
were oblivious to the aesthetic qualities of the things that
surrounded them. Indeed, a patron would seek out a famous artist
8

and pay more for one image or object than another precisely
because artistic ability, innovation, and beauty were highly
valued. In most cases, however, especially before the 16th century,
such considerations remained very much secondary to art’s
non-aesthetic functions – whether social, devotional, political,
or practical – and to the iconography or subject depicted.

Art-making in Renaissance Europe

Imagine how difﬁcult it must have been to hack out by hand the
enormous marble block from the mountainside quarries of Carrara
that was used for Michelangelo’s famous statue of David, a ﬁgure
that stands more than ﬁve metres tall with its base (see Figure 34).
After laboriously dislodging the massive block, it had to be dragged
down to the Arno River several kilometres away, loaded onto a
barge, transported up-river to Florence, and then moved again to a
sculptor’s workshop with nothing more than donkeys for assistance.
Although another artist ﬁrst started working on this statue, both he
and Michelangelo had only hand-powered tools available with
which to carve, chisel, and polish the ﬁgure. And any work
undertaken outside daylight hours would have had to be limited
to what could be done safely by candlelight.

Introduction: whose Renaissance? whose art?

It is also important for us, as early 21st-century beholders, to
keep ﬁrmly in mind the very physical, hands-on effort that was
involved in actually producing the art that survives from 15th- and
16th-century Europe. Nowadays, when we are used to artists being
judged for how innovative, ground-breaking, or even outrageous
their ideas and concepts may be, rather than for how skilful or
technically proﬁcient they are, it is easy to forget just how much
craft and expertise – as well as hard, physical labour – was involved
in producing even a small painting on a wooden panel, let
alone an entire cycle of frescos on a massive church wall or an
over-life-sized statue in solid marble or molten bronze, all in an
era before electricity, engines, mass-produced paint and paper,
temperature-controlled furnaces, and photography were available.

Similarly, the hot, sweaty, and often dangerous process of casting a
life-size bronze ﬁgure is brought home to us by Benvenuto Cellini’s
mid-16th-century description of the ﬁnal stages involved in
producing his statue of Perseus (see Figure 35):
Very, very slowly I lowered [the mould] to the bottom of the furnace
and . . . . ﬁlled [it] with a great many blocks of copper and other
bronze scraps . . . and [began] to melt it down . . . . [But soon] the
workshop caught ﬁre and we were terriﬁed that the roof might fall
in on us . . . . and [then] I found that the metal had all curdled . . . .
As soon as all that terrible confusion was straightened out, . . . .
there was a sudden explosion and a tremendous ﬂash of ﬁre, as if a
thunderbolt had been hurled in our midst . . . . When the glare and
noise had died away, we . . . realized that the cover of the furnace had
cracked open and that the bronze was pouring out. [So] I hastily . . .

drove in two plugs. Then, seeing that the metal was not running as
easily as it should, I realized that the alloy must have been consumed
in that terriﬁc heat. So I sent for all my pewter plates, bowls, and
salvers . . . and put them . . . into the furnace . . . . And then in an
instant my mould was ﬁlled. So I knelt down and thanked God with
all my heart.

Although not quite as dramatic, painting a fresco was also a
laborious process that involved producing life-size drawings known
as ‘cartoons’ (from the Italian word for heavy-weight paper, cartone)
which were transferred onto a thin layer of wet plaster trowelled
onto a carefully prepared brick wall. The artist then had to ﬁll in the
outline quickly with paint before the plaster dried. The work also
had to be done very accurately, since there is no way to ‘correct’ a
fresco by painting over it, given the transparency of the colours,
much as is the case with watercolours. Often working well above
ﬂoor level on rickety scaffolding, without the beneﬁt of electric
lights, and forced to hold a paintbrush in an outstretched hand for
hours at a time, it is no wonder that even as famous an artist as
Michelangelo complained bitterly of having an aching back and
neck, not to mention droplets of paint falling into his eyes, while
10

completing the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (see Figure
36). Although popular legend has it that he painted this massive
commission while lying on his back, the actual situation, in
which he had to stand under damp and dripping paint-covered
plaster for literally months on end, seems quite uncomfortable
enough.

Conclusion
While new ideas about ‘Art’ and the status of the artist did begin to
develop during the period, the craft involved in making an image or
object, together with its function and iconography, were often
valued as much, if not more than, its aesthetic qualities by the
patron and original beholders. Renaissance visual and material
culture also comprised a balancing act between a sense of
11

Introduction: whose Renaissance? whose art?

The preparation of wooden panel paintings such as Domenico
Veneziano’s St Lucy Altarpiece, which were covered with a layer
of white plaster-like gesso in order to create a smooth surface
on which to apply the traditional egg-based tempera paint, is
comparatively much less arduous but still demands a high level of
technical expertise (see Figure 3). Beginning in Northern Europe,
the growing popularity of oil paints, ﬁrst used on panels by artists
like Jan van Eyck then later on ever-larger linen canvases,
made the process of painting and, if necessary, correcting what
one had painted somewhat easier, as seen in the size and volume
of canvases Titian and his workshop were able to produce by the
16th century (see Figures 18 and 23). Nevertheless, the process
of making preparatory drawings without the aid of photographs
and the level of skill needed to select wood that wouldn’t warp,
stretch canvas so it wouldn’t sag, and prepare the surface ‘ground’
of a painting so the hand-mixed tempera and oil paints wouldn’t
ﬂake or run off is something that those of us used to relying on
cameras and the mass-produced materials of uniform quality
readily available at our local art supply shop can have difﬁculty
imagining.

continuity with the artistic traditions of the late Medieval period
and a desire to promote innovation through the revival of ideas
associated with the Classical world. Many of these inherent tensions
are demonstrated particularly clearly in what is perhaps the most
important artistic genre of the period, the altarpiece, which is the
focus of the following chapter.

12

Chapter 2
The art of the altarpiece

Altarpieces, old and new
Prior Francesco Ottobon falls asleep in the Venetian church
of Sant’Antonio di Castello while praying to God to protect his
fellow monks from the ravages of the plague. Suddenly, he has
a vivid dream in which ten thousand early Christian martyrs
carrying crosses march into the church to be blessed by St Peter
himself, dressed in full papal regalia (Figure 2). After the
procession ﬁnishes, he hears a mysterious voice, which tells
him: ‘Do not doubt, remain constant, and I decree that by the
intercession of all of these [martyrs] you will be saved from
the imminent peril.’ When, subsequently, none of his colleagues
contract the plague, he asks his nephew to commission a
grand altar with a costly marble frame in thanksgiving for
the martyrs’ intervention. The altarpiece’s central image,
painted by Vittore Carpaccio, shows the death by cruciﬁxion
endured by these very saints in the Holy Land. The prior must
have asked Carpaccio to make another painting in which
both this new altarpiece, completed in 1515, and his original
vision were depicted in a single composition, as seen in Figure 2.
(The new altarpiece is located under the third arch from
the right.)
This interior view of the church also shows other objects known
13

Renaissance Art

2. Vittore Carpaccio, The Vision of Prior Ottobon in Sant’Antonio di
Castello, oil on canvas, c. 1515

as ex-votos commissioned by grateful devotees, such as the two
model ships that were hung from the rafters by sailors saved at sea
after praying for divine assistance. The painting shows as well two
additional altarpieces along the church’s side wall but it is unclear
whether these too were tokens of thanksgiving for past
intercessions or pious donations made in anticipation of their
patrons’ deaths, when prayers would need to be said in order to
ensure the future salvation of their souls. Whatever their speciﬁc
motives, the donors of all three altarpieces did not envision these
works merely as static, decorative images to be admired for their
aesthetic qualities. Instead, these objects were intended to be
actively incorporated into the rituals associated with the Masses
celebrated at regular intervals before them, Masses that were often
sponsored and underwritten ﬁnancially by the patrons themselves.
In other words, donating an altarpiece also implied donating
additional funds to pay for a priest to say a Mass in front of the
image on your behalf in perpetuity – or at least until the money
ran out.
14

Not only did the structure of altarpieces change over the course of
the 15th century but the way in which such works were evaluated
by their contemporaries changed as well. Although the skill of the
artist was clearly important in commissioning and producing
the two polyptychs seen in the prior’s painting, the patrons
and original beholders of these works would probably have been
just as impressed by the costly materials that had been deployed,
such as the sheets of gold leaf used for the gilding or the precious
ultramarine blue made from crushed lapis lazuli imported from the
Middle East used on the robes of individual holy ﬁgures. Indeed,
well into the 15th century, contracts between patrons and artists
often speciﬁed in great detail what quality and quantity of expensive
paint or gold was to be used. But as artists and their patrons
became increasingly eager to depict ﬁgures and settings more
naturalistically, the use of gilded backgrounds began to look more
and more old-fashioned. At the same time, the very abilities needed
15

The art of the altarpiece

The painting of Prior Ottobon’s vision is of particular interest to art
historians because it demonstrates visually the shift that occurred
over the course of the 15th century in the design, although not in the
function, of altarpieces. While the altarpiece commissioned by the
prior’s nephew in the early 16th century shows a single, uniﬁed
narrative scene painted in oil on canvas and housed in an elegant
structure evoking Classical architectural forms, the two earlier
altarpieces, probably produced in the 14th or early 15th century, are
strikingly different. Rather than a single central scene of ﬁgures
positioned within a naturalistic landscape setting, these works
depict instead a number of individual holy ﬁgures in full or half
length against a gold background, each painted on a separate
wooden panel, probably in tempera. And instead of the classicizing
geometry of columns, rounded arches, and triangular pediments
seen in the later altarpiece’s frame, these two earlier polyptychs
(so named because they are many-panelled works) set their ﬁgures
under individual pointed arches similar in shape to those seen in
Medieval buildings like the church in which they were originally
installed.

to paint ﬁgures and backgrounds in a convincingly naturalistic way,
combined with a growing interest in stylistic and compositional
innovation for its own sake, meant that artistic skill and ingenuity
began to be increasingly valued by more progressive patrons over
and above the cost of the materials actually used.
The early 15th-century Florentine architect, sculptor, and art
theorist Leon Battista Alberti clearly articulates this gradual shift
from material to artistic values:
There are painters who use much gold in their pictures because they
think it gives them majesty: I do not praise this. Even if you were
painting Virgil’s Dido – with her gold quiver, her golden hair
fastened with a gold clasp . . . and all her horse’s trappings of gold –
even then I would not want you to use any gold, because to represent
Renaissance Art

the glitter of gold with plain colours brings the craftsman more
admiration and praise.

The artists Alberti most admired did, in fact, use ‘plain colours’
alone to represent the natural world and human anatomy with
increasing precision, as well as to depict buildings and architectural
spaces in a convincingly three-dimensional manner, as we shall
discuss at greater length in the fourth chapter.

The altarpiece in Italy
One interesting early example of the new style of painted altarpiece
is the panel made by Domenico Veneziano in c. 1445–7 for the
Florentine church of S. Lucia dei Magnoli, probably to replace an
older multi-panelled work with a gilded background (Figure 3).
Although the composition’s three-bayed architectural structure
still echoes older arched, three-panelled triptychs, the artist has
clearly sought to present beholders with a single, spatially uniﬁed
scene that seems to be a continuation of the space in which we
ourselves stand. The link between image and beholder is further
heightened by the outward gaze and pointing gesture of the second
16

ﬁgure from the left, John the Baptist, who seems to invite us in
personally to worship the Madonna and Child appearing before our
eyes.
The architectural space depicted in Giovanni Bellini’s San Giobbe
Altarpiece (Figure 4), painted before 1478, is even more
convincing. The work was commissioned to fulﬁl the demands,
devotional as well as social, of its patrons, who were members of
the Confraternity of San Giobbe (St Job), a kind of charitable
organization and social ‘club’ for well-to-do Venetian citizens.
Rather than employing real gold leaf, Bellini used only the ‘plain
colours’ advocated by Alberti (albeit relying on shimmering oil
paint rather than the much more matte tempera used in the St Lucy

Altarpiece) to depict the glittering half-dome of what appears to
be a fully three-dimensional chapel. Indeed, Bellini is so consistent
in producing this illusion that he even includes a hanging
lamp in the upper section of the composition, depicted as if
submerged in dark shadows while apparently dangling between
our space and the ﬁctive chapel, which is lit by a mysterious divine
light.

In Raphael’s Sistine Madonna, which we encountered in the ﬁrst
chapter, the illusion is not of the Virgin appearing to us as if in an
actual chapel, but rather of curtains being drawn aside from an
enormous window, through which we see St Mary coming down
from Heaven to present her precious Child to us (see Figure 1).
Once again, however, one of her saintly sidekicks gestures outwards
as if inviting the beholder to enter the scene. The gesture is
particularly signiﬁcant once one realizes that the bearded ﬁgure
who makes it is St Sixtus, patron saint of Pope Sixtus IV, the
deceased uncle of the then pope, Julius II, the man probably
responsible for commissioning this work for the high altar of a
19

The art of the altarpiece

One explanation as to why Bellini came up with this innovative
design lies in the architectural situation of the Venetian church of
San Giobbe in which the painting was originally hung along one
of the nave’s walls. Thanks to a canal running along one side, the
church could not have accommodated an actual three-dimensional
chapel on this side of the building. But, in any case, no real chapel
could have allowed the artist to link the world of his patrons with
the visionary world depicted in the altarpiece so successfully. Here,
in a heavenly apparition that seems to be a seamless extension of
our own space, we see the Madonna solemnly raising her hand to
bless the devotees gathered before the altar, with the nearly nude
ﬁgure of St Job on the left interceding with clasped hands on our
behalf, and the sympathetic ﬁgure of St Francis (whose order, the
Franciscans, were in charge of the church) on the far left reaching
down with his outstretched hand as if to invite us individually to
join the holy gathering.

convent of Sistine nuns in the Italian city of Piacenza. The
delightful angels at the bottom of the composition, who lean on a
window ledge that seems to exist somewhere between our space and
the heavenly realm depicted in the painting, thus serve a speciﬁc
devotional function: they help to bridge the gap between this world
and the next, thereby allowing the prayers of the nuns for whom the
image was originally made to entreat the Virgin more directly on
behalf of the dead pontiff’s soul. Thus, although the angels are
clearly beautiful beings well suited for our aesthetic contemplation
in the Dresden gallery where the painting hangs today, it is only by
setting them into their original context and trying to see them
through the ‘period eye’ of their original beholders that the non-, or
better, extra-aesthetic aspects of the composition become apparent.

Renaissance Art

Carved and painted altarpieces in the North
An interest in using innovative visual means to enhance the
long-standing devotional, social, and even occasionally political
functions of altarpieces can also be seen in works produced by
artists in Northern Europe. In the 15th and early 16th centuries,
artists and patrons in Germany and the Low Countries began to
develop new visual and iconographic strategies, while at the same
time maintaining traditional altarpiece formats that had their
origins in the Middle Ages. So, rather than a shift from polyptychs
to altarpieces with a single, central painted scene, as was the case in
Italy, artists such as Matthias Grünewald in the Isenheim Altarpiece
of c. 1513–15 and Tilman Riemenschneider in the Altar of the Holy
Blood of c. 1499–1505 continued to use the Medieval winged retable
altarpiece as their basic structural unit. The retable (which comes
from the Latin for ‘behind the [altar] table’), which could be
painted or sculpted, consisted of a central group of individual
ﬁgures or, later, a single image, in either case ﬂanked by shutter-like
wings on each side that usually could be closed, to protect the
interior section, or opened on special religious feast days.
While the structures of these altarpieces broadly recall those of their
20

Rather than using the highly descriptive medium of oil paint,
Reimenschneider’s Altar of the Holy Blood in the southern
German city of Rothenburg engaged its beholders by exploiting the
particular qualities of limewood as a medium and by playing with
the lighting possibilities of the Church of St Jakob in which the
work still stands to this day (Figure 6). Unlike the brightly
painted carved retables of his predecessors and, indeed, many
of his contemporaries, the wooden ﬁgures and reliefs in
21

The art of the altarpiece

Medieval predecessors, the fact that they sought increasingly to be
more physically and psychologically convincing and began to favour
uniﬁed pictorial ﬁelds instead of individually displayed saints has
obvious parallels with developments in Italy. In the case of the
Isenheim Altarpiece, while the innermost central core still consists
of individual gilded statues of saints displayed within an elaborate,
Gothic-style framework, the three sets of wings and two sets of
central panels that cover and surround these ﬁgures are very
different in both style and spirit (Figure 5). In these panels, oil
paints are used to depict key intercessory ﬁgures (including the
Madonna), the resurrected Christ, and, in the central panel of
the outermost ‘layer’ of the altarpiece, an astonishingly gruesome
Cruciﬁxion scene. Here, Christ’s body is covered in oozing,
pus-ﬁlled lacerations, his cracked lips painted in the dry
bluish-white of the dead. However, this shockingly naturalistic
image would probably not have seemed out of place to the work’s
original beholders. These were desperately sick pilgrims who had
travelled to Isenheim (in the Alsace region, located around the
present-day Franco-German border) to seek a miraculous cure
for an excruciatingly painful and deforming fungal disease
known as ‘St Anthony’s Fire’, which made victims’ limbs turn
black and green with gangrene before eventually falling off.
For such beholders, seeing the dead Christ portrayed in horrifying
detail would have perhaps suggested that their Saviour could
empathize with their sufferings and that, like Jesus, they too
would one day be resurrected into perfect, whole, and healthy
bodies.

In addition to the Last Supper in the centre, the altarpiece also
originally housed in its lower section the town’s most precious
sacred relic, believed to be a drop of Christ’s own blood. Of course,
it was at the Last Supper that Christ had instituted the celebration
of the Eucharist, which included having the apostles drink his
blood-as-wine. The subject chosen for the central section of
the retable was thus most appropriate for the altar’s reliquary
functions, which would have been uppermost in the minds of the
work’s patrons, the town councillors of Rothenburg. The innovative
visual and material strategies developed by Riemenschneider in this
work were thus once again deployed in the service of his patrons’
needs, rather than primarily to fulﬁl an abstract aesthetic brief.

23

The art of the altarpiece

Reimenschneider’s Rothenburg altarpiece were painted just in
translucent brown glazes, with the only exceptions to the overall
monochromatic scheme being dots of black paint on the ﬁgures’
pupils and dabs of pale red glaze on their lips. Like Grünewald’s
outermost central panel, the central section of this work also
focuses on a single, uniﬁed narrative scene, in this case a threedimensional rendering of the Last Supper, with the ﬁgure of Judas
in the middle caught in the act of betraying Christ. By avoiding
the thick gesso undercoating that normally had to be used when
painting wooden ﬁgures in bright colours, Reimenschneider
was able to make the most of limewood’s relative softness and
pliability by carving much ﬁner and more psychologically
convincing details than could have been seen under a thick layer
of opaque paint. He further enhanced the scene’s dramatic impact
by using roundels of thick, clear glass behind the Last Supper
rather than having a solid wooden back wall as was usually the
case, thereby allowing the natural light from the tall windows
behind the altar to become an active and ever-changing component
of the narrative scene.

Making and meaning in Raphael’s Entombment
The way in which the innovative formal and iconographic strategies
deployed in such pre-Reformation altarpieces could be combined
with the genre’s long-standing devotional and social functions is
also highlighted by the ﬁnal work we will consider in this chapter,
Raphael’s Entombment of Christ of 1507 (Figure 7). On
a formal level, this painting displays the artist’s extremely
sophisticated compositional skills and his ability to incorporate
almost effortlessly visual references to antique sources, such as
Roman sarcophagi reliefs depicting the dead hero Meleager being
carried away for burial. At the same time, the story of its making
demonstrates the wide range of devotional, personal, and even
political meanings that could be embedded in a single Renaissance
altarpiece, aspects that are often lost when such a work is seen on a
gallery wall, far removed from its original context.

Indeed, it is signiﬁcant that the carpenter who made the shrine-like
structure that housed Riemenschneider’s carvings was initially
supposed to be paid 50 ﬂorins, exactly the same amount as the
sculptor himself. Only after the altar had been completed did the
latter’s fee increase to 60 ﬂorins, thanks to a special bonus payment
given for a job well done. But the fact that ‘mere’ carpentry was
valued nearly as highly as an object that we would today consider a
work of art is very revealing. Indeed, this payment scale conﬁrms
that the councillors’ ﬁrst priority was to produce an attractive and
functional devotional complex that would enhance their city’s
reputation and entice more pilgrim-tourists – and their spending
power – to Rothenburg to worship their prize relic. Seen in this
light, it makes perfect sense that the patrons were as keen to
ensure that the town’s key attraction was properly ‘packaged’
in a wooden shrine as they were to commission moving and
aesthetically pleasing sculptures for the interior sections of
the altar.

Renaissance Art

7. Raphael Sanzio, The Entombment of Christ, oil on panel, 1507

The altarpiece was commissioned by a noblewoman, Atalanta
Baglioni of Perugia. Atalanta had been widowed at a relatively
young age and, having never remarried, she had become the head of
her household. Signiﬁcantly, this meant that she was now in charge
of the family’s wealth and income, an unusual situation for a
woman in this period, but one that would have allowed her to
decide independently to hire the ambitious young artist. At the time
of Atalanta’s commission, Perugia was a city of violence: not only
did the town engage in military skirmishes with its neighbours, but
inside its walls, its powerful ruling clans were frequently involved
in bloody feuds with rival families. In the case of the Baglioni,
the ﬁghts were not just with other families, but also amongst
themselves. One of the most notorious incidents involved Atalanta’s
26

son, Grifonetto, who in 1500 had tried to murder all his senior male
relatives during a family wedding feast. A number of kinsmen were
killed but those who survived the carnage vowed revenge on the
young upstart. Grifonetto managed to escape but only after his
mother had refused to grant him protection inside her own house.
When Grifonetto returned to Perugia, planning to beg his relatives
for forgiveness, he was instead immediately stabbed repeatedly by
one of his aggrieved kinsmen. Atalanta rushed down to her dying
son but, rather than giving him any motherly comfort, she instead
coldly ordered him to forgive his assassins, thus demonstrating very
publicly that she was willing to put family honour ahead of
maternal instinct.

Raphael’s skill and ingenuity in creating such a moving image were
obviously crucial to its success. Indeed, it is likely that, in this work,
27

The art of the altarpiece

However, a few years later, Atalanta decided that something had to
be done to try to redeem the memory of her dead son and, perhaps,
to try to atone for her own rather heartless behaviour in his moment
of need. So, she decided to ask Raphael, who had worked for several
years in Perugia before moving to Florence, to return to the city in
order to paint a splendid new altarpiece on her behalf. Rather than
depicting a group of static standing saints, however, Atalanta’s
altarpiece showed a poignant narrative scene of the dead Christ
surrounded by mourners and about to be carried away to his
grave. Here, in Raphael’s visually complex image, with gracefully
intertwined ﬁgures moving rhythmically across the front plane of
the picture like a Classical relief scene, the tragic death of a son is
ﬁnally mourned by a mother. Indeed, the Virgin Mary is shown
collapsing dramatically under the intolerable weight of her grief on
the far right side of the picture, perhaps a way for Atalanta to atone
visually for her emotionally restrained public response to her own
child’s demise seven years earlier. The altarpiece would, in any case,
have served as the visual focus for the commemorative Masses
Atalanta would have arranged to be said in perpetuity for the soul
of her son – and, implicitly, for her own future salvation as well.

Renaissance Art

Raphael had sought to supercede artistically both his presumed
teacher, the local painter Perugino, who had produced an altarpiece
with a very similar subject a dozen years before, and his own earlier
works, including an altarpiece painted in Perugia for female
members of the Oddi family, great rivals of the Baglioni. But,
ultimately, as we have seen in many of the other examples
considered in this chapter, Raphael’s undoubted artistic abilities
were deployed ﬁrst and foremost in the Entombment to fulﬁl the
demands of his patron, not the demands of ‘Art’ in our present-day
understanding of the word. Seen in their original contexts,
therefore, such altarpieces were much more than just pretty
pictures; instead, they were the visual and material embodiments
of complex webs of devotional, social, and even political demands
that the most successful artists of the 15th and early 16th centuries
would have sought to fulﬁl in new and ever more innovative ways.

Conclusion: sacred images and iconoclasm
The altarpiece tradition, with its roots in Medieval polyptychs
and winged retables, continued throughout the 16th century and
beyond in Italy, France, Spain, and the Catholic areas of Northern
Europe. But the tradition came to an abrupt, even violent, end
in towns and regions engulfed by the ﬂames of the Protestant
Reformation from the early 16th century onwards. Reformers
such as Martin Luther, after carefully considering the Biblical
commandment explicitly forbidding the making of ‘graven images’
(Exodus 20: 4–5), began to argue that pictures of holy ﬁgures and
sacred stories had no place in churches and, possibly, even in the
private devotional practices of believers. Such ideas were given
further support by the long history of very real abuses associated
with religious paintings and statues that, despite repeated warnings
issued over the centuries, had often in practice been worshipped
and adored as though they were themselves holy, rather than merely
representations of the divine. While some Reformers did allow
certain types of religious images to continue to be used in strictly
limited ways as aids to devotion, others not only forbade the making
28

of any new religious artworks but actually sought systematically to
destroy all existing sacred statues and paintings, with altarpieces a
particular focus of their fury. In 1566, a British witness described
one such act of devastation in the Cathedral of Antwerp, one of the
main towns in the Southern Netherlands, in what is known today
as Belgium:
I went into the church . . . . It looked like a hell, as if heaven and
earth had gone together, with falling images and beating down of
costly works . . . all, destroyed! [It was] the costliest church in
Europe; and they have so spoiled it, that they have not left a place
to sit on in the church.

29

The art of the altarpiece

Such virulent iconoclasm, which occurred from the third decade
of the 16th century onwards in different parts of Northern Europe,
according to local religious but also political circumstances, not
only resulted in the wholesale destruction of literally centuries of
religious art of all types, including innumerable altarpieces, but also
severely reduced the working opportunities for artists who had
previously relied so extensively on lavish altarpiece commissions
for their livelihoods. In the Protestant North after about 1520,
art-making was not a particularly good career choice unless one
was willing to concentrate on generally smaller-scale and thus less
well remunerated secular genres such as portraiture, as we shall
see in Chapter 5. But for painters and sculptors working in Catholic
lands, the altarpiece tradition would continue triumphantly for
centuries to come.

Story-telling in
Renaissance art

Ursula’s tale: a very Venetian story
In Britain was a Christian king . . . [with] a daughter named Ursula.
This daughter shone full of marvellous honesty, wisdom, and beauty
. . . . And the King of England [who still worshipped pagan idols] . . .
said that he would be well happy if this virgin might be coupled to
his son by marriage. And the young man had great desire and will to
have her. And there was a solemn embassy [sent] to the father of
Ursula, and promised great promises, and said many fair words for
to have her . . . . And she, that was divinely inspired, did consent . . .
to the marriage [on the] . . . condition: that . . . the young man
should be baptized [and allow her to go on pilgrimage accompanied
by 11,000 virgins. The prince] . . . commanded all that Ursula had
required should be done . . . . [and so] they went towards Rome.

Thus began the tale of St Ursula in the Golden Legend, a collection
of sacred stories compiled by a 13th-century archbishop of Genoa,
Jacopo da Voragine. The book was hugely popular throughout
Europe, perhaps almost as readily available as the Bible itself. By
1500, nearly 75 Latin editions had been printed, not to mention
several more in English, Italian, French, German, and Bohemian. It
would therefore have been quite easy for the Venetian confraternity
known as the Scuola di Sant’Orsola to track down a detailed
description of the legendary life of their patron saint, Ursula, when
30

they decided to commission a new set of paintings for their
clubhouse to replace some old, worn-out frescos.

In this canvas, we see in the distance the ship from which the
ambassadors have disembarked moored at the far end of a grand
square. At the front of the picture plane in the central section of
the canvas, the ambassadors themselves are shown in a ceremonial
procession that unfolds across the painted surface from left to right.
The ﬁgures are depicted almost as if in a sequence of still frames
from a ﬁlm: ﬁrst, just peeking out from the second column from the
left, we see two ﬁgures standing; then two more ﬁgures seem to be
in the process of kneeling down; while the next two ﬁgures are
shown on fully bended knees before the enthroned king. The sense
of an almost cinematic progression in time and space continues in
the far right scene of the canvas, in which the beautiful young
saint is shown standing in a much more private space with a
richly canopied bed, discussing the marriage proposal with her
world-weary father, his head resting in the palm of his upturned
hand. It is here, at this point in the tale, that Ursula makes the
fateful, albeit ‘divinely inspired’, decision to ask her suitor to convert
to Christianity and allow her to go on a pilgrimage to Rome with a
retinue of 11,000 virgin women. In the narrative canvases that
31

Story-telling in Renaissance art

In 1488, the confraternity, which included men as well as women
and true patricians as well as the merely well-off, hired a young,
up-and-coming artist named Vittore Carpaccio, whom we have
already encountered in the previous chapter, to illustrate the
story of St Ursula in a series of large canvases approximately
three metres high and up to six metres long. These paintings,
executed between 1490 and 1500, were hung all around the
interior of the building that served as both the confraternity’s
meeting house and its communal chapel. They depicted the life
of St Ursula in a slowly unfolding narrative sequence, beginning
with the embassy sent by the King of England to bid for the
beautiful Christian princess’s hand in marriage for his son
(Figure 8).

Father, oil on canvas, 1490s

follow, we see the ambassadors’ departure, followed by the princess
bidding farewell to her ﬁancé, travelling to Rome to meet the pope,
and then, tragically, being murdered (and thus martyred), together
with all her female companions, on the trip back to England by a
pagan horde of Huns.

On the days around the annual feast of St Ursula on the 21st of
33

Story-telling in Renaissance art

Despite the dramatic possibilities of the story, the visual emphasis
in many of Carpaccio’s canvases is often on the tale’s ceremonial
moments, with ﬁgures processing to and fro or being ofﬁcially
greeted by kings, popes, and princes. The stress laid on such ritual
behaviour would have reﬂected the ceremonies and rituals in which
the confraternity’s members themselves were regularly engaged.
For instance, once a month, the entire membership of the Scuola di
Sant’Orsola would gather in the meeting house to celebrate a Mass
together, an event that would kick off with each member holding a
candle in his or her hands while processing around the perimeter of
the room. In fact, this monthly procession would very much have
echoed the painted processions depicted on the canvases displayed
on the walls of the chapel-clubhouse. In many of the canvases, the
artist has used a variety of other visual strategies to further break
down the boundaries between actual beholders and Ursula’s ﬁctive
world. In the canvas depicting the arrival of the ambassadors, for
instance, a space is left open in the balustrade at the front of the
picture plane as if to allow us to join the English delegation, while
on the right of the canvas, a staircase guarded only by an elderly
female servant seems to invite us into the bedroom where Ursula
and her father are having their heart-to-heart discussion. Likewise,
just beyond the metal railing separating the ambassadors from the
enormous public square, we see a row of local spectators leaning
on the fence while looking at the events in progress with great
fascination – much as we, also separated from part of the scene by
a railing, do as well. In other words, the spectators inside the scene
on some level seem to mirror the beholders standing in front of
the canvas.

Renaissance Art

October, the confraternity’s members would themselves have been
on public view, with processions and other festivities in honour of
their patron saint taking place not only inside their meeting house,
but also outside on the public square in front of the building, where
fellow Venetian citizens would have observed their rituals and
ceremonies at ﬁrst hand. Carpaccio’s canvases thus told tales that
would have had a very direct relevance for the men and women who
had commissioned them, tales with a visual narrative structure that
in many cases mirrored the actual ceremonial structure of the
confraternity’s own rituals. At the same time, these rituals and the
images commissioned by the Scuola di Sant’Orsola straddled the
sacred-secular divide, much like the confraternity itself, which was
both a religious and a social organization. This is reﬂected in the
fact that the story of St Ursula not only emphasized religious
themes such as devotion to one’s faith even in the face of
martyrdom or the enticing proposals of a pagan king, but also
echoed the social rituals of Venetian ceremonial life and, with its
images of ships sailing to and from distant lands, recalled the
international trade upon which Venice’s economic and political
life depended.

Narrative images: sacred or secular?
In many other examples, it can be equally difﬁcult to decide
categorically whether the stories told by Renaissance artists in their
works should be tied exclusively to either the sacred or secular
realm. For instance, the St Lucy Altarpiece, which we considered
brieﬂy in the previous chapter, originally had small narrative images
known as predella panels positioned directly beneath each of the
ﬁgures in the main scene (see Figure 3). At ﬁrst glance, these
pictures, which depict a signiﬁcant episode in the life of each saint
standing above, might seem to be purely religious paintings.
However, the fact that two of these depicted key events in the lives
of Florence’s most important patron saints, John the Baptist and
Bishop Zenobius (both also depicted in the main scene), suggests
that the person who commissioned the altarpiece might well have
34

wanted to demonstrate political loyalty to his home town as well
as make evident his religious sentiments. In the case of Raphael’s
Entombment, the sacred narrative of the main panel was as
much a product of Atalanta Baglioni’s complicated personal and
political concerns as it was intended to serve as the focus for
pious devotion during the Mass (see Figure 7). Likewise, an early
16th-century collector buying the set of 17 woodcuts illustrating
the Life of the Virgin by Dürer would have appreciated these
images not only for their devotional efﬁcacy in telling a sacred
narrative, but also for the fact that their beautiful compositions
had been devised by one of Northern Europe’s most highly
esteemed artists.

35

Story-telling in Renaissance art

A similar tension between the secular and the religious can be
seen in hand-copied illuminated prayer books known as ‘books
of hours’, an art form dating back to Medieval times but still
very much alive in the Renaissance, even well after Johannes
Gutenberg had invented the modern printing press in the mid-15th
century. Although books of hours were used within the private
devotional practices of devout believers, they were also fantastically
expensive luxury items hand-crafted with precious pigments
and gold leaf on sheets of vellum made from animal hides.
Not surprisingly, only the very rich could afford such objects,
and thus these books inevitably attested to their owners’ wealth,
taste, and prestige as much as to their piety. A particularly ﬁne
example of such a book is the one commissioned for Mary,
Duchess of Burgundy, in about 1480. The frontispiece, or ﬁrst
illustrated page, shows the duchess herself reading an illuminated
manuscript very much like the one that had been made for
her (Figure 9). Beyond her seated ﬁgure, through an open
window, we see the duchess depicted once again, this time attended
by ladies in waiting in a vast church and kneeling before her
namesake saint, the Virgin Mary. The picture within the painting is
presumably meant to make visible the other-worldly scene that
would have been conjured up in Mary’s own mind after reading the
religious tales and reciting the prayers found in her book of hours.

9. Master of Mary of Burgundy, Mary of Burgundy Reading a Book of
Hours, with a Vision of the Madonna and Child in a Church,
illumination on parchment, c. 1480

While it is highly likely that she was a genuinely devout woman,
the expense and effort involved in hand-copying and painstakingly
illustrating such a work in the ﬁrst place would have made a very
clear statement about her social, political, and economic status
in the present world – something further emphasized by the
enormous jewels lying casually on the windowsill and the luxurious
velvets, silks, and brocades worn by Mary and her attendants in
this image.

. . . images of the Virgin and Saints were introduced for three
reasons. First, on account of the ignorance of the simple people, so
that those who are not able to read the scriptures can yet learn by
seeing the sacraments of our salvation and faith in pictures . . . .
Second, images were introduced on account of our emotional
sluggishness; so that men who are not aroused to devotion when
they hear the histories of the Saints may at least be moved when they
see them . . . in pictures. Third, they were introduced on account of
our unreliable memories . . . . because many people cannot retain in
their memories what they hear, but they do remember if they see
images.

37

Story-telling in Renaissance art

Of course, as we saw in the previous chapter, one could argue that it
was sacrilegious to make a concrete image of any religious story or
sacred ﬁgure given that the Ten Commandants explicitly forbade
the production of ‘graven images’ of any kind and, especially, the
veneration of such images. Already in the 7th century, however,
Pope Gregory the Great had decreed that religious images could
be made (although not actually worshipped) in order to enlighten
the illiterate. Looking at images was also considered a more
efﬁcacious means of remembering scripture and being moved
by sacred narratives than was the case for the spoken or written
word alone. These arguments in favour of religious pictures
were summed up in 1492 by Michele da Carcano, a Dominican
friar:

Renaissance Art

A fresco cycle in Florence
One of the most publicly accessible depictions of sacred narratives
were the large-scale fresco cycles that had been painted on the
walls, domes, and ceilings of churches and chapels for centuries. In
the Renaissance, this practice continued, with new visual strategies
such as linear perspective and the use of increasingly accurate
depictions of human anatomy deployed to make the stories ever
more vivid and convincing. For instance, in the Florentine church of
S. Trìnita, we see key scenes from the life and afterlife of St Francis
depicted on the walls of one of the chapels (Figure 10). At ﬁrst
glance, these images painted by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his
assistants in the mid-1480s seem perfectly designed to fulﬁl the
devotional requirements of ‘legitimate’ religious images: by
portraying signiﬁcant events associated with St Francis and
situating some of the scenes in contemporary Florentine settings,
the frescos would have made the stories depicted accessible to
those who could not read and particularly memorable and moving
to all and sundry.
The story of Francis and the miracles he was believed to have
performed after his death are depicted in chronologically
consecutive circles going from top to bottom. So, on the uppermost
level of the chapel’s walls, we see (moving clockwise) the young
Francis renouncing his inheritance in order to lead a life of holy
poverty, the Pope ofﬁcially approving the new Franciscan order he
had founded, and Francis miraculously surviving a trial by ﬁre while
visiting a sultan’s court. On the middle level, Francis is shown
receiving the stigmata (that is, having the wounds of Christ appear
on his own body) on the left wall, and his funeral is depicted on the
right wall, while in the centre we see the miraculous resurrection of
a dead child after prayers were addressed to the deceased saint.

altarpiece, and Giuliano da Sangallo (attr.), black marble tombs of
Francesco Sassetti and Nera Corsi (in niches on side walls), 1483–6
38

Renaissance Art

However, the fact that this last event, which is hardly ever seen
in other cycles dedicated to St Francis, is shown so prominently
above the chapel’s altarpiece and slightly out of chronological
order (that is, this posthumous miracle is depicted before the
scene of the saint’s funeral on the right wall) suggests that
the chapel was perhaps not made exclusively to transmit
accurately and vividly key aspects of a holy narrative to illiterate
devotees.
Instead, this scene and the entire lower level of the chapel conﬁrm
that something other than pure piety was involved in this project.
For it is here, at the level closest to the visitor to the chapel, and in
the prominently placed frescos set directly above the altarpiece, that
the demands of the patron, Francesco Sassetti, become evident.
Sassetti was the general manager of the Medici family bank and
thus his fortunes were closely tied to the ﬁnancial and political
success of this powerful Florentine clan. Not only did he choose to
make his namesake saint, Francis, the main subject of his family
chapel’s frescos, but he also made sure that his Medici bosses and
their allies were favourably represented as well, speciﬁcally, by
including their individual portraits in the two central wall’s main
frescos. In the uppermost fresco, the head of the family, Lorenzo de’
Medici, is shown standing by Francesco in a setting clearly intended
to recall Florence’s main townhall square. The next scene down, in
which a child is miraculously resurrected, is also set in Florence,
this time in the square in front of the church of S. Trìnita itself.
Given that Francesco’s own eldest son had died at the time that
Ghirlandaio began designing the fresco cycle, with another male
child miraculously born just a few months later, it is likely that an
image of a resurrected boy set above an altarpiece depicting the
Nativity of Christ (also painted by Ghirlandaio) might have been an
act of thanksgiving on the patron’s part for the birth of his new son.
Indeed, it has even been suggested that the resurrected boy is
actually a portrait of Francesco’s youngest son.
Finally, just to make the personal motivations absolutely clear,
40

Francesco not only installed black marble tombs (possibly made by
the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo) with classicizing motifs for
himself and his wife, Nera Corsi, in the two niches on the left and
right lower level of the chapel, but he also had himself and his
spouse depicted kneeling in prayer on either side of the altar,
participant-witnesses at the Nativity portrayed in the altarpiece
and at all the Masses said on behalf of their souls at the altar
itself. So, while prayer and piety were certainly important motives
for commissioning the fresco cycle, enlightened self-interest both
in this world and the next played an important part as well.
The story told here, in other words, was as much Francesco’s
as St Francis’s.

The practice of depicting a sacred story while at the same time
commemorating, or even glorifying, a patron is also evident
in the sculptor Guido Mazzoni’s Lamentation, a life-size,
three-dimensional tableau of painted terracotta ﬁgures of grieving
mourners surrounding the dead body of Christ (Figure 11).
The group was completed in the early 1490s and installed in the
Church of Sant’Anna dei Lombardi in Naples. Here, the beholder is
literally able to enter into the sacred narrative that is enacted by
fully in-the-round sculpted beings. Signiﬁcantly, however, one of
the mourners, the man kneeling at the far left, and thus closest to
the visitor as he or she approaches this three-dimensional tableau,
is a portrait of the project’s patron, King Alfonso II of Naples. Not
only was Alfonso trying to guarantee his spiritual salvation by being
depicted for all eternity in perpetual prayer and adoration before
Christ, but such an ensemble, originally installed in his own family
chapel, and a project in which he was not just a witness but
an actual participant in the sacred drama, would clearly have
enhanced his personal and political reputation as well. Once
again, a personalized sacred narrative seems to have been
deployed to smooth the way for a patron both in this world and
the next.

Although the lack of a clearly demarcated division between the holy
and the profane in such projects can seem somewhat confusing to
present-day viewers, Renaissance patrons, artists, and beholders
might not have felt obliged to make such distinctions in the ﬁrst
place, seeing instead a continuum between the sacred and the
secular. Nevertheless, some stories told by Renaissance artists
were clearly of a purely secular nature, with no discernible hint of
religious piety to muddy the waters from our point of view. In these
cases, however, the tales told were once again designed to enhance
the reputation of the person who had commissioned them. This can
be seen in the mythological and allegorical images commissioned by
the French king François I for his château, or country palace, in
Fontainebleau, not far from Paris. Here, employing mainly artists
imported from Italy, such as Rosso Fiorentino and Primaticcio, the
king sought to bafﬂe and amaze elite visitors though the use of
complex visual iconographies for the elegant paintings that were set
within elaborate, highly mannered stucco frames and displayed in
42

12. Giovanni Battista Rosso Fiorentino, Danae visited by Jupiter disguised as a Shower of Gold, fresco with
surrounding stucco reliefs, 1530s

the château’s main public rooms and galleries. Only the king
himself was fully apprised of the precise meaning of each painting.
In fact, the ‘narrative’ aspects of these works were not just found in
the stories depicted within the paintings, but also enacted in the
guided tours or, better, performances given by the king himself for his
visitors, as he elucidated each picture’s signiﬁcance to the amazement
of the onlookers. One of the more straightforward tales depicted was
that of Danae, the beautiful girl impregnated by the pagan god Zeus
who had appeared to her in a cloud of golden rain (Figure 12). But
the exact iconographic signiﬁcance of other images commissioned
by François are still the subject of scholarly debate to this day.

Renaissance Art

Conclusion
Renaissance art, whether sacred, secular, or somewhere in between,
was full of stories. Indeed, one of the primary functions of art in
general in this period was to communicate stories and ideas by
visual means to contemporary beholders in ways that were often
more enticing, vivid, and memorable than was possible in a text,
sermon, or speech alone. As Alberti put it in the 1430s, the most
successful visual narrative, or istoria, was one that was ‘so agreeably
and pleasantly attractive that it will capture the eye of whatever
learned or unlearned person is looking at it and will move his soul’.
In the public realm, narrative altarpieces (both painted and
sculpted in three dimensions), predella panels depicting saints’
lives, paintings for confraternities, grand fresco cycles in churches,
and Classically inspired palace decorations not only helped
beholders remember particular stories through their attractive
imagery, but also inevitably reﬂected the personal, political,
and social agendas of the people or organizations that had
commissioned them. Sometimes, as in the case of illuminated
manuscripts or a set of narrative prints, story-telling could be a
more private, even intimate, activity involving just one person
holding a book or sheet of paper in his or her hands. But even in
such instances, how a particular story was told pictorially, and how
it was interpreted, depended very much on the interests, beliefs,
and priorities of the patron and his or her contemporary beholders.
44

Chapter 4
The challenge of
nature and the antique

Fictive ﬂies
We see before us a portrait of a well-to-do husband and
wife posing behind a table-ledge on which a variety of meticulously
depicted objects are displayed (Figure 13). On the lower edge
of the frame, the date 1496 is visible, along with the ages of
the couple, indicating that he was 36 and she 27 when the image
was completed. The coat of arms at the top of the composition,
cradled by a bull, symbol of the Evangelist Luke, was associated
with the Antwerp painters’ Guild of St Luke, as were the delicate
buds, known as stock-gillyﬂowers, displayed in the vase and
held in the woman’s hand. This, combined with the male
sitter’s direct outward gaze, has suggested to many scholars
that the panel may, in fact, be a self-portrait of a painter with
his wife. Interestingly enough, if the artist had been looking
into a mirror while painting this work with his right hand, it
would be this hand that would correspond to the one hidden
beneath the ledge in the picture, a common strategy in artists’
self-portraits given that it is very difﬁcult indeed to depict one’s
own hand while it is in use.
The artist usually linked with the painting on stylistic grounds is the
Master of Frankfurt, so called because one of the most important
works associated with this ﬁgure was made for a church in that city.
45

13. Master of Frankfurt (active in Antwerp; possibly Hendrik van
Wueluwe?), Portrait of an Artist and His Wife, oil on panel, 1496

However, from the coat of arms and the general style of the
painting, it is highly likely that the artist was actually based in
Antwerp. Documentary evidence suggests that this anonymous
painter may, in fact, have been one of the most active and
prominent artists in Antwerp in the ﬁrst decades of the
16th century, one Hendrik van Wueluwe, who, among other
positions, served as dean of the Guild of St Luke for an
unprecedented six terms of ofﬁce and who, in the same year
in which this portrait was painted, was recorded as buying a stone
house and marrying Heylwich Thonis, daughter of a fellow artist
who had also served as dean of the guild.

But suddenly, we realize that something has unexpectedly disturbed
this perfect vision of marital peace and prosperity: on the pure
white painted surface of the panel that depicts the demure
headdress of the lady of the house, a big, black, ugly ﬂy has dared
to land. However, when we try to swat it away, we realize that the
artist has fooled us with his artistry, for this is not a real ﬂy perched
on the surface of the painting, but rather a ﬁctive one depicted
47

The challenge of nature and the antique

Art historians have tended to focus on trying to conﬁrm the
painter’s identity and to decipher the symbolic meanings of the
various objects depicted. For instance, some observers have linked
the cherries (known as the ‘fruit of paradise’) scattered on the
centrally placed plate to the iconography of the Virgin Mary, the
mystical bride and mother of Christ and thus a most appropriate
model for a newly wed wife. Indeed, the fairly intimate pose of the
couple, along with the tantalizing fact that van Wueluwe was
married in 1496, has led to the suggestion that this painting may
have been made to commemorate the couple’s marriage. The fact
that hunks of bread and a cup of wine, symbols of the Eucharistic
rituals associated with the Mass, are prominently displayed
enhances the sense that solemn vows have been exchanged
and implies that this image may have been intended as a visual
guarantee that God’s blessing had indeed been bestowed upon the
new couple.

Renaissance Art

within the composition itself. As if to further demonstrate
his mimetic skills, the artist has not only included another
entomologically correct ﬂy crawling beside the plate of fruit –
although this time clearly ‘inside’ the painted scene – but he
has also precariously balanced a sliver of bread on the front of the
table-ledge, an object that, like the ﬂy on the headdress, seems to be
positioned somewhere between our space and the ﬁctive space of
the portrait.
It is the ﬂy that appears to have just landed on the panel’s surface,
however, that suggests that something more than a mere visual
gag is in progress. Indeed, one could argue that this insect and,
especially, the deliberately illusionistic way in which it has been
painted tell us something important about the professional
ambitions of this particular artist and, more generally, about the
aspirations of art (or rather, ‘Art’) itself in this period, for a ﬂy that
can fool a beholder is a visual trope with a long history. Already in
the mid-15th century, the Italian artist Antonio Filarete had used
just such an example to demonstrate the outstanding abilities of
Giotto, perhaps the most famous artist of the later 13th and early
14th centuries. In his treatise, Filarete claims that, while still a mere
apprentice, Giotto had painted ﬂies which his master Cimabue had
tried to ﬂit away with a rag, thus demonstrating just how much skill
the younger artist must have had if he could fool even a fellow
professional painter.
Much more venerable was the story told by the ancient Roman
writer Pliny the Elder in his 1st-century collection of anecdotes
about famous artists, a text ultimately based on even older sources.
According to Pliny, two of antiquity’s greatest painters, Zeuxis and
Parrhasios, had a competition to see who was better at replicating
the real world in his art. First up was Zeuxis, who produced a
painting of a bunch of grapes that was so convincing that birds ﬂew
up to it and tried to eat the fruit. Then Parrhasios decided to go one
better and invited his rival to see the result. Zeuxis impatiently
dashed to Parrhasios’s workshop to see the new picture and, in his
48

haste, tried to pull off the curtain that the latter had apparently
hung over the painting. At that very moment, however, Zeuxis
realized that he had lost the competition, for the curtain
covering the painting was in fact a ﬁction, merely an illusionistic
representation along the lines of the curtains that seem to be
being drawn open in Raphael’s Sistine Madonna (see Figure 1). But
this time, it was not just a ﬂock of birds that had been fooled; rather,
Parrhasios had fooled one of the greatest artists of the ancient
world, thereby demonstrating his own superior skills as a painter.

Whether any or all of these tales are actually true is irrelevant, since
it was by the very act of repeating such topoi, or stock themes, most
probably initially inspired by Pliny’s well-known tale, that we begin
to appreciate just how highly Renaissance culture valued an artist’s
ability to mimic the real world accurately and convincingly. Thus,
choosing to depict a ﬂy as if it had just landed on the surface of a
painting in which he had very probably portrayed himself was a
highly appropriate way for the Master of Frankfurt (whoever he
may have been) to allude visually to both his artistic skill and his
prestigious Classical predecessors.
49

The challenge of nature and the antique

In the 16th century, similar anecdotes were repeated again and
again with slight variations. For instance, the Italian writer Pietro
Aretino described a mother ewe bleating joyfully when she saw a
lamb in a painting by Titian, while another writer claimed that a
dog had barked at a portrait of its master painted by Dürer. In his
Lives of the Artists published in two editions in the mid-16th
century, Vasari implied that, as in Pliny’s tale, not only animals but
people too could be fooled by such trompe l’oeil paintings. In one
such anecdote, Vasari described passersby paying homage to what
they thought was the pope himself, but actually was just a portrait
left by Titian to dry in a window. The art theorist Zuccaro similarly
described not just random pedestrians, but an actual cardinal
who mistakenly had tried to hand a pen to another pontiff’s
portrait, this time by Raphael, in order to obtain a signature on
a document.

Renaissance Art

Competing with the Classical and natural worlds
In general, Renaissance artists sought not only to imitate nature
and evoke the Classical age, but actually to surpass them both.
Indeed, competing with the prestige of antiquity and the reality
of the natural world became a touchstone for some of the most
self-consciously innovative art of the Renaissance. For instance,
Dürer’s superb 1504 engraving of Adam and Eve (Figure 14)
used as models for its ﬁgures two of the most famous antique
statues known in the Renaissance, the Medici Venus and the
Apollo Belvedere (so named because the former belonged to
the Medici family and the latter was displayed in the Belvedere
courtyard in the Vatican). Here, in a very precisely imagined
vision of Eden where even a cat and a mouse (both in the
foreground) are still able to live in peaceful co-existence in a
pre-Lapsarian world, the perfect bodies of Adam and Eve,
as yet free from sin, are literally embodied by two icons of
Classical art, but now set within an explicitly Judaeo-Christian
context. In this image, which as a print could be distributed to
discerning collectors far and wide, Dürer demonstrated to his
contemporary beholders that, despite his German pedigree,
he felt just as much at ease with deploying such Classical
prototypes as any Italian artist, who would have had the beneﬁt
of literally being surrounded by the remains of the ancient
Roman world.
The marble statue of the Apollo Belvedere, which was itself a
Roman copy of an even older Greek original, also served as the
model for a superbly crafted, partially gilded dark bronze
statuette by the north Italian sculptor Piero Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi,
known by the nickname ‘Antico’ precisely for his afﬁnity to such
antique prototypes (Figure 15). This small-scale work not only
demonstrated the sculptor’s ability to absorb and reinterpret
Classical art in a particularly skilful manner, but also attested to his
patron’s exquisite taste and intimate familiarity with Classical
learning. In this particular case, the patron in question was the
50

Marchesa of Mantua, Isabella d’Este, one of the most famous
collectors of actual ancient objects in this period, as well as a patron

for ‘new’ works of art as well. For both Isabella (who we will
consider again in Chapter 6) and Antico, ancient models, both
visual and literary, were not only aesthetically pleasing and
dramatically satisfying in and of themselves. Rather, these models
51

15. Antico (Piero Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi), Statuette of the Apollo
Belvedere, partially gilded bronze with silver inset eyes, c. 1497–8

were also valued simply because they were ancient, such was the
prestige of the long-lost ‘golden age’ of Rome and Greece
worshipped by Renaissance humanists and their followers. Indeed,
this sense of yearning for a lost past and a desire to reawaken it in
body and spirit in the present day can even be seen in the motto
adopted in the later 15th century by Lorenzo de’ Medici, head of one
of the most inﬂuential families in Renaissance Italy: le temps
revient – literally, ‘time [or, better, the past] returns’.

Leonardo’s proto-scientiﬁc approach to exploring phenomena
from limbs to landslides in the later 15th and early 16th centuries
may have been inspired, at least in part, by the highly precise
renderings of nature seen in Northern European painting already
in the ﬁrst half of the 1400s. Northern artists such as Jan van
Eyck, whom we will consider in the next chapter, concentrated
primarily on depicting with minute accuracy all aspects of the
real world, from fruit and ﬂies to fabrics and furnishings, a kind
of detail-oriented painting perfectly suited to the oil-paint
medium that seems to have been developed ﬁrst in the
Netherlands in the early part of the 15th century. In Italy,
artists like Leonardo, perhaps inﬂuenced by such Northern
53

The challenge of nature and the antique

One of the qualities most admired in the Classical statues, coins,
and gems that were the most common surviving ancient artefacts
known in this period was their ability to represent in a realistic
and convincing manner the human body. Artists in both the
North and South sought to rival and then surpass the ancients
in this respect, as well as by depicting illusionistically other
natural phenomena not generally seen in the Classical art
available to Renaissance beholders, such as ﬂora, fauna, and
even entire landscapes. In the case of Leonardo da Vinci, page
after page of drawings attest to his desire to unravel the mysteries
of the natural world through close studies of plants, animals,
and the human body, as seen in his splendid sketch of a dissected
human chest, shoulder, and arm in four slightly different
positions (Figure 16).

16. Leonardo da Vinci, Four sequential studies of the superﬁcial
anatomy of the arm, shoulder, and chest, pen and ink with wash on

examples, also sought to observe nature ever more carefully.
However, in comparison to artists working in the North, Italian
practitioners were somewhat more concerned with accurately
depicting human anatomy in particular through drawings of living
models and dissections of dead ones, as seen in Leonardo’s almost
cinematic rendering in pen and ink of the human arm viewed as if
in slow motion.

Perfecting perspective

In his book De Pictura (On Painting) ﬁrst published in Latin in
1435, Alberti, whom we have already encountered in previous
chapters, sought to codify mathematically the principles of linear
perspective, a technique that allowed both solid objects and
architectural spaces to be depicted systematically and convincingly
on a ﬂat painted or sculpted surface through the use of orthogonal
lines receding to a single vanishing point ideally coordinated to the
eye level of the beholder. Alberti himself apparently did not use
the technique he described in any paintings or sculptures of his
own, instead relying extensively on the experiments of others
when writing his book. First and foremost among these was the
sculptor and architect Filippo Brunelleschi, who had ingeniously
completed the great octagonal dome of Florence’s Cathedral, a
project ﬁnally ﬁnished in 1436, the same year Alberti published an
55

The challenge of nature and the antique

Equally important to Italian artists, however, was the accurate
and convincing depiction of buildings and architectural spaces.
While in the North, precisely rendered objects were what was
crucially needed to suggest that an artist had captured the ‘real’
world in his or her art, in Italy, convincingly realistic objects
and people had to be positioned in equally illusionistic spaces.
Although, ever since Giotto, artists had been intuitively
perfecting the depiction of three-dimensional structures and
spaces by a process of trial and error, in the early 15th century,
it suddenly became possible to do so with mathematical
precision.

Renaissance Art

Italian-language edition of his treatise dedicated to (among others)
Brunelleschi. Already in about 1424–5, Brunelleschi had used local
Florentine architectural landmarks, including the Baptistry located
in front of the Cathedral, to demonstrate his mathematically based
technique of depicting buildings and urban spaces illusionistically.
Soon, other artists working in paint, fresco, and even relief
sculpture also began to use Brunelleschi’s approach, especially once
Alberti’s treatise became available. However, given that the majority
of the surviving copies of this text are in Latin, the language of elite
humanist scholars and patrons, it seems likely that most practising
artists learned to use linear perspective by word of mouth and by
looking closely at early 15th-century works such as the highly
illusionistic Trinity fresco painted by Masaccio or the perspectival
marble and bronze reliefs produced by the sculptor Donatello.
The painter Domenico Veneziano was one such artist, although he
may also have beneﬁted from discussions with his colleague Piero
della Francesca, a painter who wrote mathematical treatises of his
own later in the century, including one on perspective. Domenico’s
St Lucy Altarpiece of c. 1445–7 (see Figure 3), discussed brieﬂy
in the second chapter, demonstrates not only a thorough
understanding of the principles of linear perspective, but only a
decade after Alberti’s treatise ﬁrst appeared, shows that he was also
trying to manipulate the technique for his own ends. Although the
altarpiece’s main central panel is clearly intended to show a single,
uniﬁed scene, Domenico’s decision to set his ﬁgures within a
tripartite architectural structure consisting of an arcade with
slightly pointed arches harks back visually to earlier triptychs.
Nevertheless, at ﬁrst glance, the space seems to be constructed
according to the rules of linear perspective. Indeed, if one
approached the altarpiece from the position of a kneeling devotee
or priest at the altar, the ﬁrst thing one would have probably noticed
from this position was the intricate and highly detailed ﬂoor tiles
along the bottom edge of the painting, just above the predella.
Almost like a diagram in a mathematical treatise, these tiles are
foreshortened and recede convincingly from the panel’s lower edge
56

to the base of the Madonna’s throne. The arched arcade and shell
niches in the background appear to be equally carefully constructed
along strictly mathematical principles.

The very precisely rendered ﬂoor tiles conﬁrm that Domenico was
well versed in the practice of linear perspective. His apparent
‘errors’, therefore, should be seen instead as consciously willed
subversions of the mathematical principles involved, subversions
intended to allow the painting to best achieve its main purpose,
namely, to be a successful devotional image and a work that would
glorify both the church in which it was originally installed, S. Lucia
dei Magnoli in Florence, and the wealthy patron who had paid for
it. So, although Domenico’s patron clearly wanted an altarpiece that
looked ‘up-to-date’ thanks to perspectival elements such as the ﬂoor
tiles and the use of a single uniﬁed scene for the main panel, a very
traditional and hierarchical devotional structure nevertheless
57

The challenge of nature and the antique

But appearances can be deceiving: although the ﬂoor tiles are
indeed correctly depicted according to the rules of linear
perspective, the rest of the architecture and the ﬁgures set within
it are profoundly ambiguous. For instance, while the face of the
arcade along the top edge of the painting seems to be at the very
front of the imaginary picture plane’s surface, in the middle and
lower areas of the painting, it becomes evident that this cannot be
the case since the four side saints are clearly supposed to be
standing in front of this structure, not underneath its arches.
Likewise, while the Madonna seems at ﬁrst glance to be enthroned
within the central shell-topped niche, the position of the columns
makes it apparent that she must actually be seated quite some
distance in front of the niche, with the lower edges of her robe
suggesting that she may even be positioned slightly in front of the
ﬁrst row of columns. One soon realizes that the Madonna must also
be enormous in comparison both to the architecture and the other
ﬁgures. Indeed, were she to stand up, not only would she dwarf the
saints beside her, but she would probably be almost as tall as the
columns that ﬂank her throne.

Renaissance Art

remained embedded in the painting’s composition. This was
achieved by using architectural elements to fence off visually the
central Madonna and Child from the side saints (who included
the church’s namesake, St Lucy, and two of Florence’s patron
saints, John the Baptist and Bishop Zenobius) as had been
the case in earlier triptychs, and by having the Virgin tower
physically and symbolically over all the other ﬁgures. Likewise,
the panel’s somewhat hallucinatory spatial and inter-ﬁgurative
relationships would have emphasized the visionary aspects of
the scene for the devout beholders who originally gazed upon the
painting.
From the early 15th century onwards, the technique of linear
perspective described by Alberti was used by artists in highly
imaginative ways in order to create visually convincing spaces for
sacred and secular subjects, thereby turning paintings and reliefs
into windows onto imaginary worlds that could seem to rival reality
itself. Perhaps the culmination of this approach is another work by
Leonardo, his much-reproduced and much-damaged fresco of the
Last Supper (Figure 17). This work had already started to ﬂake
and peel off the wall of the refectory of the Church of S. Maria delle
Grazie in Milan shortly after Leonardo had ﬁnished painting it in
the later 1490s using an experimental oil-on-plaster technique that
was almost immediately deemed a failure from a technical point of
view. The enduring success of the work in the public imagination,
however, is due to a combination of the artist’s great sensitivity
in depicting naturalistically the varied emotional states of the
participants at this Eucharistic drama and his equally convincing
spatial setting.
The painting’s patron was Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, whose
attachment to the monastery of S. Maria delle Grazie was such that
he dined with the monks twice a week in the refectory, that is, in the
very room where Leonardo’s rendition of history’s most famous
17. Leonardo da Vinci, The Last Supper, mural painting, 1495–7/8
58

Renaissance Art

meal was located. Looking only at a photographic reproduction of
the composition, one might assume that the ﬁctive dining room is a
seamless continuation of the real refectory’s space. However, once
again, as in the case of the St Lucy Altarpiece, the artist has actually
manipulated the rules of linear perspective for his own purposes.
Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the single vanishing point that this
technique requires is set, like the painting itself, well above the
eye level of the beholder standing or seated in the refectory, thus
making it impossible to ever see the work from its ideal viewing
position. Similarly, the table that dominates the foreground of the
composition, while appearing to be properly foreshortened on its
own, is actually positioned extremely ambiguously in relation to the
ﬁgures and the ﬁctive architectural space, for which it appears to be
much too long and narrow upon closer inspection. And, once again
like the St Lucy Altarpiece, the central sacred character of Christ
himself is actually painted on a much larger scale than any of the
surrounding apostles. Leonardo’s Last Supper, therefore, subverts
the strict rules of linear perspective and relative proportionality in
order to achieve a particular effect, namely, a sense of narrative
urgency and dramatic tension swirling all around the ﬁgure of Jesus
seated calmly and serenely at the very centre of the sacred scene – a
scene that seems to be both part of, yet mysteriously separate from,
our own physical world.

Conclusion
Linear perspective, like the close observation of nature, the human
body, and Classical models, was seen by Renaissance beholders as
something worthy of careful study and theoretical contemplation in
its own right. However, when it came to deploying such approaches
in actual works of art, painters, sculptors, and their patrons were
perfectly willing to modify and adapt ‘reality’ – whether past or
present, spatial or natural – for their own purposes, artistic and
otherwise. As we shall see in the following chapter, such tensions
between the real and the ideal also haunted one of the
Renaissance’s most popular genres, the portrait.
60

Chapter 5
Portraiture and the
rise of ‘Renaissance man’

Images of individuals
According to the inﬂuential mid-19th-century Swiss historian Jacob
Burckhardt, whom we encountered brieﬂy in the ﬁrst chapter,
the Renaissance was the moment when the modern notion of
‘individuality’, indeed, the very concept of the self as an autonomous
entity, ﬁrst fully manifested itself, eventually giving rise to an ideal,
multi-talented ‘Renaissance man’ or uomo universale. Since
the publication of Burckhardt’s The Civilization of the Renaissance
in Italy in 1860, scholars have vigorously debated the merits
of such broad and sweeping claims and have pointed out that
well-rounded, self-aware individuals can be found in earlier
periods as well.
Although it is notoriously difﬁcult to prove or disprove theories
about a paradigm shift in the Weltanshauung, or ‘world view’, of a
particular age, there is no doubt that the Renaissance did see an
explosion in the production of painted and sculpted portraits of
recognizable individuals. Of course, independent painted portraits
of a very small number of kings and pontiffs had existed long before
the Renaissance, with even some slightly lower-ranked members
of the elite, such as bishops or high nobles, portrayed in efﬁgy on
their tombs. Likewise, donor portraits, in which the wealthy and
powerful patron of a work such as an altarpiece would be depicted
61

Renaissance Art

within or at the edge of a sacred scene, had also existed since the
Middle Ages.
Similar portrayals of the sacred and secular elite certainly
continued to be produced throughout the 15th and 16th centuries.
But beginning in the early 1400s, other categories of sitters, such as
women, well-to-do merchants, and even artists, also began to be
represented in ever-greater numbers in independent portraits.
And even in portraits of the traditional elite, a growing interest in
individual psychology and physiology is evident, thereby reﬂecting
the period’s new approaches to depicting space, nature, and
human anatomy increasingly naturalistically. The very interest in
individual portraiture also reﬂected the Renaissance revival of
Classical antiquity, since ancient writers had focused on the
biographies of famous individuals, while ancient coins and marble
busts of Roman emperors and their less exalted citizen-subjects still
existed to be studied, admired, and used as models for new
commissions by Renaissance patrons, collectors, and artists.
We have already encountered several portraits in this book,
suggesting just how varied this genre could be. As in centuries
past, a king is portrayed as a participant-donor in the Lamentation
commissioned by Alfonso II for a Neapolitan church, but now the
patron is included as a fully three-dimensional and emotionally
engaged being, demonstrating the sculptor’s sophisticated
understanding of the human body (see Figure 11). Similarly,
an elite noble is shown on a page of an illuminated manuscript
produced in the later 15th century, but now the aristocrat is a
woman, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and the objects, fabrics, and
spaces that surround her exhibit an appreciation of the new taste
for naturalistic depiction (see Figure 9). However, it is in the double
portrait of an artist and his wife that we discussed at length in the
previous chapter that we see just how far portraiture had expanded
its reach by the later 15th century (see Figure 13). In this image, we
see a well-to-do, but certainly not aristocratic, artist-craftsman and
his wife portrayed with as much care as would have been demanded
62

by a pope or prince in centuries past. Although poorer men
and women were still resolutely excluded from the growing
fascination with the individual that Burckhardt identiﬁed as a
key characteristic of the Renaissance, there is no doubt that a focus
on the self and on projecting one’s own image to the wider world
had begun to express itself across a much broader spectrum of
society than had previously been the case.

In fact, it is helpful to assess Renaissance images of individuals
in terms of their qualities as portraits versus their success as
likenesses, with the two categories not necessarily always
overlapping. So, for instance, we know that Leonardo used
preparatory drawings he had made of living models’ faces and
bodies as the basis for his very convincing likenesses in the Last
Supper (see Figure 17), but we could not really, strictly speaking, call
these images ‘portraits’. Similarly, we know from documents that, in
her old age, Queen Elizabeth I of England allowed only a limited
number of pre-approved templates to be used by artists when
63

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

When we look at a Renaissance portrait, we often assume that the
image is a straightforward depiction of what the person portrayed
‘really’ looked like, as though we were gazing upon a kind of painted
or sculpted version of a photograph. However, as we well know,
even photographs can be highly manipulated images rather than
transparent representations that faithfully mirror reality. Just as a
21st-century photographic portrait can involve the use of ﬂattering
lighting, specially selected clothing, and a bit of make-up – not
to mention the services of a programme such as PhotoShop to
airbrush any unattractive wrinkles or blemishes from the digital
image ﬁle before we hit the ‘print’ button – so too was a Renaissance
portrait a very deliberately crafted and carefully constructed thing.
In the portrait of the artist and his wife, for instance, we see the
couple dressed in their best clothes, with the things that surround
them, from the stock-gillyﬂowers and cherries to the suggestive
ﬂies, all assiduously considered for their visual and symbolic
signiﬁcance.

Renaissance Art

painting her image. These authorized models depicted the Queen as
being still young and beautiful, with the resulting works clearly
intended to be understood as portraits, but certainly not to be
considered accurate likenesses of the ageing monarch (see Figure
24). Similarly, Titian painted a portrait of Isabella d’Este, a patron
and collector we discussed brieﬂy in the previous chapter, at the age
of 60 as though she were still little more than a teenager.
Even in portraits that seem to be less obviously ﬂattering ﬁctions,
one needs to be wary of trying to separate reality from idealization.
Indeed, only in a very small number of cases where several portraits
exist of the same sitter painted by different artists can we even
begin to try to sift the one from the other. But ‘ﬂattery’ was not
just about making ladies of a certain age look young and perky;
rather, it was also about putting the best possible ‘spin’ on the social,
economic, and political status and aspirations of the individuals
portrayed.

Portraiture in Italy
For instance, Titian’s later 1530s portrait of Francesco Maria della
Rovere, Duke of Urbino, shows him as a mature man, with a slightly
receding hairline and some furrows lining his brow (Figure 18).
But the Duke’s steady, steely gaze peering out from a light-coloured
face that stands out against a generally dark background is clearly
meant to attest to his courage and determination, with his wrinkles
simply conﬁrming that he must be wise and experienced as well.
Such attributes would, of course, have been exactly what a man who
was a famous condottiere, or professional army general, as well as
a titled noble, would have wanted to project when commissioning
this portrait. In fact, the writer Pietro Aretino assumed that the
portrait as a whole and the various objects depicted within it were
a kind of visual summary of the Duke’s entire career as seen, for
instance, in the deluxe imported German suit of armour he wears
and the feather-topped helmet displayed on the red velvet-covered
shelf behind him, or in the various batons seen on this same ledge
64

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

and in his right hand, each representing one of the separate
commands he had held with the armies of Venice, Florence, and
the papacy.
Interestingly enough, the Duke’s wife, Eleonora Gonzaga, daughter
of Isabella d’Este, was also painted by Titian in a pendant portrait
presumably intended to be hung beside her husband’s image.
But in contrast to the ideal manly attributes of a Renaissance
warrior-prince standing haughtily to attention, she is shown in a
65

Renaissance Art

much more relaxed, seated pose dressed in ﬁne velvet brocade and
frilly lace wearing a tasteful selection of jewellery, her hair tucked
into a luxurious embroidered cap, all most appropriate for a rich,
discerning, yet demure nobleman’s wife. To make the point
absolutely clear, while the objects that surround the Duke seek
to portray him as the ideal military man, the Duchess’s most
prominent attribute is a little dog, traditional symbol of marital
ﬁdelity.
Almost exactly a century earlier, Alberti had written that art
should strive to show the ‘movements of the soul’ through the
‘movements of the body’; in other words, to depict the inner
person through outward signs. But it is impossible ever to discern
with any conﬁdence from paintings like those of the Duke and
Duchess of Urbino what they ‘really’ looked like, let alone what
they were ‘really’ like as individual personalities. Instead, from
their carefully considered poses and attributes, we can only
determine how they hoped and wished to be seen by their
contemporaries and, crucially, by their descendants, since
portraiture almost always served a commemorative and dynastic
function as well.
Although famous Italian artists such as Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci produced portraits throughout their careers – including, in
the latter case, the iconic Mona Lisa – the genre of portraiture
itself was often seen by Italian Renaissance art theorists as lower on
the artistic scale than, say, major religious paintings or historical
narratives. Michelangelo, for instance, only ever drew one proper
portrait, so much did he distain a genre that he believed required
only the ability to copy reality mechanically rather than demanding
true artistic innovation or ingenuity. Indeed, Michelangelo
famously told a contemporary who had complained of his sculpted
efﬁgy of a Medici duke looking nothing like the sitter that, in
a 1,000 years, no one would know or care about the man’s
appearance, whereas all would still marvel at the artist who
had so skilfully carved his statue.
66

Portrait-painting in the North
In Northern Europe, in contrast, portraiture was more generally
appreciated as an art form, especially after the Reformation,
when commissions for religious images and objects had all but
disappeared in Protestant regions, to be replaced by an ever-greater
number of commissions for secular works such as portraits. In
fact, given the genre’s higher status in the North, it is no surprise
that some of the most famous and intriguing portraits of the
Renaissance were painted by artists working in England, France,
Germany, and the Low Countries.

67

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

One of the best-known Renaissance portraits is by the
Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck who, with his brother
Hubert, had produced one of 15th-century Europe’s most
remarkable altarpieces, a multi-panelled winged retable known
as the Ghent Altarpiece. In 1434, two years after completing
this work, Jan painted a much more humbly scaled, but
equally memorable double portrait depicting a couple standing
hand-in-hand in a domestic interior (Figure 19). This panel
is known as the Arnolﬁni Portrait since documentary evidence
suggests that the man depicted may be Giovanni Arnolﬁni,
a wealthy merchant from the Italian city of Lucca who made
his fortune as an expatriate in Bruges, a town in present-day
Belgium, and who was married to Giovanna Cenami. The panel
is not only an important early example of a work in the new
medium of oil paint ﬁrst developed in the North and then later
taken up by Italian artists, but also possibly the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
portrait made of sitters who were not part of the traditional
sacred or secular elite. Although the couple were clearly
well-to-do, as suggested by the expensive fabrics, furnishings,
and ﬁttings displayed throughout the composition, they were
certainly not aristocrats, but rather a self-made man and his
wife. The couple are shown in full-length, a pose previously
reserved almost exclusively for the very elite of the elite.
Moreover, they are shown within their own home, surrounded

19. Jan van Eyck, The Arnolﬁni Portrait, oil on panel, 1434

by their own possessions, rather than as donors within a larger
religious scene.

But who exactly has witnessed this legally binding ritual? In
the convex mirror in the background, we see two small ﬁgures,
presumably the people to whom the man is gesturing and who,
implicitly, must be standing in front of the scene portrayed. In fact,
the ﬁgures may well be intended to represent the artist, Jan van
Eyck, and one of us, as the implied beholder standing beside him.
This suggestion is given further support by the fact that directly
above the mirror we see written on the wall the date 1434 and the
words ‘Jan van Eyck has been here’, a phrasing that is as much a
kind of conﬁrmation of his presence as a witness as it is a signature.
So, this portrait may well commemorate ofﬁcially the couple’s
marital union, as well as attest visually to their economic and social
success and material prosperity.
By possibly including a miniature self-portrait within the mirror,
Jan may have also wanted to make a statement about his own
abilities as an artist: not only was he able to depict convincingly an
exceedingly complex object such as a convex mirror, but he could
69

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

Like Titian’s portrait of the Duke of Urbino a century later, however,
the couple in Jan’s portrait also use their surroundings to attest to
their circumstances and aspirations. But, apart from documenting
their wealth, what exactly is going on in this image? The couple
seem to have entered the room only very recently, since we see in the
foreground that the man has just kicked off his shoes. The dog at
the lady’s feet presumably alludes once again to her wifely ﬁdelity,
while the ceremonial laying of one hand on the other, combined
with the man’s solemnly raised right hand, gives us the sense that
we are witnessing some kind of pledge or oath. Not surprisingly,
scholars have in fact suggested that the painting may, like the
portrait of the artist and his wife we saw earlier, have been painted
to commemorate the vows exchanged by the couple at their
betrothal or engagement.

Renaissance Art

portray the entire natural world on the surface of a painting as if
seen in a mirror. Signiﬁcantly, Jan also painted what may be one of
the earliest independent artist’s self-portraits in the year between
completing the Ghent Altarpiece and beginning the Arnolﬁni
Portrait. As we have seen, by the end of the 15th century, other
artists like the Master of Frankfurt were unambiguously depicting
themselves in ways that signalled their professional aspirations.
But just how far the status of elite artists had risen by the turn
of the 16th century is best demonstrated by one of the most
remarkable self-portraits of all time, Dürer’s audacious self-portrait
of 1500 (Figure 20).
In this image, the artist showcases his incredible technical skill
through precisely rendered details such as his shiny, curling hair
and the individual tufts discernible on his luxurious fur-trimmed
collar. Perhaps even more signiﬁcantly, Dürer portrays himself in a
full-frontal pose, which recalls earlier iconic portraits of God the
Father as Salvator Mundi, or Saviour of the World. Combined with
the prominently displayed, semi-millennial date of 1500 painted
above the artist’s initials to the left of his head, this suggests that
Dürer may be trying to forge a deliberate visual link between artistic
and divine creativity. The artist, in other words, has now become a
god and, like God himself, he too can conjure up the world and all
its inhabitants in his art – a theme we will consider at greater
length in the ninth chapter. In the context of portraiture as a genre,
however, this daring display of artistic self-conﬁdence, perhaps even
hubris, highlights the important connections that exist between this
art form and new Renaissance attitudes towards individuality,
originality, and creativity.

The possibilities of portraiture: Holbein’s
Ambassadors
These links are further demonstrated in one of the most spectacular
portraits produced in this period, a work that on the one hand
seems to conﬁrm Burckhardt’s ideal of the multi-talented
70

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

20. Albrecht Dürer, Self-Portrait, oil on panel, 1500

‘Renaissance man’ but, on the other, by its very exceptionality,
reminds us that such ideals were inevitably realized by only
a very limited number of wealthy, elite, and usually male
humanist-scholars, nobles, and clerics. The work in question is
known as The Ambassadors (Figure 21) and was painted by the
German artist Hans Holbein the Younger in 1533, after he had
71

Renaissance Art

moved permanently to England, possibly in response to the
religious iconoclasm he had witnessed in the Swiss city of
Basel, his professional base for many years. Ironically, of course,
by the later 1530s, England too would begin to dismantle its
religious artistic heritage, beginning with Henry VIII’s decision
in 1536 to dissolve all Catholic monasteries and appropriate for
himself, as head of the newly formed Church of England, their
property, including any art that wasn’t ﬁrst destroyed by
iconoclastic mobs.
But this was all yet to come when the 29-year-old patron of
Holbein’s great double portrait, Jean de Dinteville, wrote to his
brother in May of 1533: ‘Monsieur de Lavaur did me the honour of
coming to see me, which was no small pleasure to me.’ Dinteville
was the learned and noble-born French Catholic ambassador to the
English court at the time that the Henry VIII was in the process of
divorcing his wife Catherine of Aragon and marrying in her stead
Anne Boleyn, a Protestant sympathizer the king hoped would
ﬁnally give birth to a male heir. In the portrait, Dinteville stands
on the left, with Georges de Selve on the right. Selve was not only
Dinteville’s close friend, but also the Bishop of Lavaur in the
southwest region of France and a fellow French Catholic diplomat
assigned to various European courts, including the papal court in
Rome. Dinteville’s letter refers to a secret visit by his friend at a time
when the former was intensely homesick for France and, especially,
for his family seat at the Château de Polisy not far from Paris.
Signiﬁcantly, the name of the château is inscribed at the centre
of the terrestrial globe displayed on the lower shelf between
the two men. We also know that, originally, Holbein’s painting
was hung in Polisy, presumably in one of the building’s grand
public rooms.
In addition to the globe, many other meticulously depicted objects
are displayed on the two-tiered shelving unit. On the top level, there
is a celestial globe of the heavens, together with a number of other
scientiﬁc instruments related to astronomical measurements and
72

time-telling, such as two quadrants and a sundial. On the lower
shelf, besides the terrestrial globe, we also see an arithmetic
book, a set of ﬂutes in a case, a lute with one broken string, and a
hymn-book. While this very diverse collection of items conﬁrms
that these are exactly the kinds of ‘universal’ men so admired by
Burckhardt, the objects on the lower shelf in particular suggest that
the image may well be more than just a visual enumeration of the
sitters’ impressively varied interests. In fact, a number of items
appear to evoke the theme of division and discord: the arithmetic
book is open to a page headed with the Latin word for ‘divide’

the fact that one ﬂute from the set stored in the case is missing all
emphasize disruption and disharmony. Interestingly enough, both
men were actively involved in trying to soothe the religious and
political differences that were engulﬁng Europe at the time,
Dinteville through his work as the ambassador of the French
Catholic monarch François I to Henry VIII’s court, and Selve by
giving important speeches at conferences organized on the
Continent to try to heal the ever-growing rifts between Protestants
and Catholics.
However, the most striking – and certainly the most visually
discordant – element in the entire painting is the strange grey shape
that seems to ﬂoat almost in front of the composition between
the two men. This is actually a very complex anamorphosis, an
intentionally distorted image that only becomes visually intelligible
in this painting if the beholder stands on the right side of the
painting and looks across its surface from a raking angle. From this
position, the shape suddenly and almost magically turns into a
hollow-eyed human skull, a symbolic reminder of death, mortality,
and the brevity of human life. It is, in short, a memento mori.
(You can try to simulate this effect by holding the reproduction in
the present volume at a right angle to your eye and then looking
closely at the shape from this angle.) Other artists, especially those
working in Northern Europe in the 15th and early 16th centuries,
had also included skulls in some of their portraits, either positioned
under a sitter’s hand or painted on the back of a picture. Likewise,
playful anamorphosic images had become quite fashionable in
courtly circles in the early 16th century. But the combination of
these trends in the disturbing, distorted, free-ﬂoating skull seen in
The Ambassadors was unique, a one-off.

Conclusion
The skull in The Ambassadors served as a visual testament to both
Holbein’s skill as an artist and his sitters’ rather morbid fascination
with death at a time of general religious and political unease.

Portraiture and the rise of ‘Renaissance man’

Although from his letters, we know that Dinteville was quite
depressed at having to stay away from his beloved Polisy for so
long when he commissioned the painting, we should not see the
image merely as the product of a gloomy ex-pat’s highly personal
preoccupations. Rather, the positive scientiﬁc possibilities alluded
to by the measuring instruments found especially on the top shelf,
together with the tiny sculpted cruciﬁx that is just visible at the top
left corner of the composition, as if peeping out from behind the
green silk curtained backdrop, are elements of hope – in the former
case, hope that mankind’s ability to be logical and rational might
yet resolve the problems of this world, and in the other, that faith
in the one true God might one day lead to salvation in the next.
However, these exceptional ‘Renaissance men’, like the exceptional
artist who painted this portrait commemorating their friendship, as
well as their hopes and fears, could not know that the trials and
tribulations of this world would only become much worse in the
years to come.

Chapter 6
Did women have
a Renaissance?

Were there ‘Renaissance women’?
In the previous chapter, we considered a small number of
exceptional ‘Renaissance men’ portrayed in exceptional and, quite
probably, highly idealized portraits. According to the historian
Jacob Burckhardt, in this period, ‘women stood on a footing of
perfect equality with [such] men . . . . [and] The education given to
women in the upper classes was essentially the same as that given
to men’. The implication is that there must have been ‘Renaissance
women’ to rival the likes of men such as Jean de Dinteville and
Georges de Selve. But did women actually have a Renaissance? In
an inﬂuential essay on this question published by Joan Kelly-Gadol
in 1977, the answer is a resounding ‘no’. Despite Burckhardt’s
claims to the contrary, even the most intelligent and noble-born
woman could not be considered the social or political equal of
men, and only a tiny minority of elite women received any kind of
formal education. Economically, with very few exceptions, women
were almost entirely dependent on men, unless they happened
to become the widows of wealthy men without subsequently
remarrying, for upon marriage, a woman transferred her social
status and wealth (in the form of a dowry) from her father’s
home to that of her husband. In fact, Kelly-Gadol has argued
that, compared to Medieval women, Renaissance women actually
had fewer legal rights, less economic power, and less political
76

inﬂuence than their predecessors. In her view, the Renaissance
was most certainly not a time of innovation and opportunity for
women.

Images of women
The ways in which attending to questions of gender can help us gain
a better appreciation of Renaissance art is suggested by considering
one of the many portraits of women produced in this period: the
16th-century Venetian-born painter Lorenzo Lotto’s painting of a
richly dressed young woman with an engaging outward gaze
77

Did women have a Renaissance?

Although such provocative conclusions have forced scholars in a
number of disciplines to reconsider many of the basic assumptions
about Renaissance culture that had been widely accepted since
Burckhardt’s day, the situation in the realm of the visual arts is not
nearly as straightforward as Kelly-Gadol implies. It is undoubtedly
true that women in the labouring classes were probably not
better off in material, political, or social terms during the
Renaissance – but then, neither were most men. At the middle
socio-economic level of artisans, craftsmen, and merchants, it is
somewhat less clear whether the majority of women were better or
worse off than in previous centuries. However, at elite levels, a small
number of women patrons did manage to make their presence felt
through their artistic commissions as much, if not more than, any of
their Medieval predecessors. Likewise, it was in the 16th century
that we begin to see for the ﬁrst time in history a very small number
of women forging successful careers as professional artists. At the
same time, much more common than either women patrons or
women artists were the literally thousands of images of real and
ideal women – whether Virgins or Venuses – that were produced
during the Renaissance, primarily for the visual consumption
and delight of male beholders. In this chapter, we will explore the
rubric of ‘women and the visual arts’ in light of all three issues,
namely, women as subjects of art, women as patrons, and women
as artists.

Renaissance Art

22. Lorenzo Lotto, Lucrezia Valier, oil on canvas (transferred from
panel), c. early 1530s

(Figure 22). The tilt of the sitter’s head and her pointing ﬁnger
direct the beholder’s eye to a sheet of paper in her left hand on
which is sketched a nude woman about to plunge a dagger into
her breast. An educated 16th-century beholder would immediately
have recognized this as an image of Lucretia, the young Roman wife
who committed suicide in order to uphold her honour after being
raped. This interpretation is conﬁrmed by the inscription on
another piece of paper on the table beneath the drawing, which
states in Latin: ‘No shame lives in the example of Lucretia.’
Based on the allusions to the ancient tale of Lucretia and other
documentary evidence, scholars have suggested that the painting
is a portrait of Lucrezia Valier, a woman from a wealthy family who
married in 1533.
Most past scholarly discussions of this image have focused on
78

New research over the past few decades along similar lines
has also forced us to look anew at one of the most famous
female images of the Renaissance, Titian’s so-called Venus
of Urbino (Figure 23). This painting of a reclining female
nude was completed in about 1538 for another Duke of
Urbino, Guidobaldo della Rovere, son of the duke whose
portrait we considered in the previous chapter (see
Figure 18). Today, inundated as we are by images of
scantily clad women in everything from beer advertisements
to Baywatch, the shock value of such a painting is
difﬁcult to appreciate. But Mark Twain, writing in the
1880s, was very clear about the dangerous and highly sexual
79

Did women have a Renaissance?

attributing the canvas, examining its iconography, and attempting
to identify the sitter. But by considering the fact that the person
portrayed is a woman, very different kinds of questions come to
the forefront. For example, it has generally been assumed that
the drawing held by the woman must have been made by a man
for an implied male beholder. However, by allowing for the
possibility that the author of the drawing may be the sitter
herself or that its ‘message’ may be intended for female beholders,
new interpretations begin to emerge. For instance, the fact
that the Lucretia in the drawing is shown in an heroic mode,
rather than as a ﬁgure for erotic contemplation, as is the case in
most other images of the subject in this period, suggests that
the sitter may have wanted to assert the young Roman matron’s
suitability as a role model for women, rather than use the
story as an excuse for the sexual titillation of male beholders.
Turning to the sitter’s costume, most scholars have considered
it only as an aid for dating and attributing the painting.
However, by assessing her clothing in light of the lives of
actual Renaissance women, one realizes that the choice
of dress could suggest that the painting was made to
commemorate one of the key events (marriage,
motherhood, widowhood) that shaped women’s lives
in this period.

Gallery:

look your ﬁll upon the foulest, the vilest, the obscenist picture the
world possesses – Titian’s Venus . . . . the Venus lies for anybody to
gloat over that wants to – and there she has a right to lie, for she is a
work of art, and art has its privileges.

There is no doubt that Guidobaldo and the male visitors to his
court, looking at this painting as it was originally displayed in his
palace in Urbino, would have recognized its potent erotic qualities
as much as Twain did.

23. Titian (Tiziano Vecellio), Venus of Urbino, oil on canvas, before 1538
81

Did women have a Renaissance?

But is this really an image of Venus? As Twain implied, giving the
composition a mythological title (which, incidentally, is not found
in any of the documents related to the original commission) that
linked the image to prestigious ancient prototypes, both visual and
literary, and displaying it as a work of Art (with a capital ‘A’) by a
famous painter like Titian, would have provided its Renaissance
and later beholders with a kind of intellectual ‘cover-story’ that
could allow soft-core porn to be admired under the much more
acceptable guise of Classical learning and tasteful art appreciation.
In recent decades, scholars interested in how notions about gender
both shape and are shaped by the wider culture have not only
exposed the underlying male–female power relations implicit in
having male beholders gaze upon such an image, but have also
questioned whether the ﬁgure actually represents Venus in the
ﬁrst place. Indeed, apart from her nudity, there is nothing that
deﬁnitively conﬁrms that this is, in fact, a picture of a Classical
mythological goddess. Instead, the rather grand interior setting
recalls an elite Renaissance palace, perhaps like the one in Urbino,
complete with luxurious bed linens and, in the background, two
female maidservants and a cassone, or storage chest for textiles

and clothing that was usually given to a woman at the time of her
marriage (see Figure 28). This has led some scholars to suggest
that the female ﬁgure could actually be the mistress of the duke, or
perhaps even his wife, rather than Venus. In any case, it is only by
exploring Renaissance attitudes towards women, both real and
ideal, and by examining the visual conventions used to portray
lovers, wives, and goddesses, that one can begin to appreciate the
complexities of such an image from the point of view of its original
beholders, rather than see it merely as a work of ‘Art’ displayed on
a gallery wall.

Renaissance Art

Women as patrons of the visual arts
Women’s roles as patrons have also attracted increasing scholarly
attention in recent years. As discussed in previous chapters, the role
of the patron was crucial to art-making in the Renaissance. Indeed,
one could argue that it was the patron who was the initiator of
almost all signiﬁcant artistic projects, and that it was the patron
who determined an individual artwork’s most important features
and characteristics, including what material it was made from,
where it was displayed, the subject it depicted, its size, and even, to
a certain extent, its style and composition. Although knowing about
a work’s patron can never explain everything about an art object,
understanding a patron’s circumstances can provide us with
important insights into why a particular work was commissioned
and why it has some qualities rather than others. This is of
particular relevance in the case of elite women patrons. Although
many of their habits and concerns as patrons parallel those of their
male contemporaries, there were important differences as well.
First, though, who exactly were the women who commissioned
works of art in the Renaissance? By far the largest number whose
patronage can be documented in this period were widows, like
Atalanta Baglioni who hired Raphael to produce an altarpiece
commemorating her murdered son (see Figure 7), or nuns living in
convents. The prevalence of widows and nuns as art patrons is quite
82

simple to explain: only these women had the ﬁnancial and social
independence to pay for works of art themselves. As a young girl
or a married lady, a woman was legally and ﬁnancially under the
control of ﬁrst her father and then her husband. Indeed, it was only
if a woman outlived her husband that she could ﬁnally decide
whether and how to spend her money on commissioning works of
art. Likewise, until joining a convent, a young nun would have been
unable to exercise any kind of independent artistic patronage
within her family home. Only upon joining a female religious
community could collective decisions about commissioning art be
made, although in many cases it was the abbess who was in overall
charge of such projects.

At the most elite levels, a very small number of women made
much more impressive and longer-lasting marks thanks to their
83

Did women have a Renaissance?

Sticking to the secular sphere, the most common artistic
commissions for women involved the tombs of their deceased
husbands. Renaissance widows were exhorted to follow the
Classical model of Artemisia, a widowed queen whose fabulous
tomb for her husband, King Mausolus, became one of the
seven wonders of the ancient world and has given us the word
‘mausoleum’. Like Artemisia, 15th- and 16th-century widows
were also usually concerned ﬁrst, foremost, and often solely, with
commissioning an appropriate funerary monument for their
husbands. Some, but not all, monuments included an efﬁgy of the
deceased spouse. Sculpted efﬁgies of women were rare, although
wives did sometimes appear as kneeling donors together with their
husbands in painted altarpieces or frescos painted for funerary
chapels as seen, for instance, in the portrait of Nera Corsi in
the Sassetti Chapel – although in this case, the project was
commissioned by her still-living husband (see Figure 10). However,
even if a widow did not make a personal appearance in her
husband’s funerary chapel, she could remind posterity of her role as
its patron through an inscription or by including her own coat of
arms as well as that of her spouse.

Renaissance Art

non-funereal artistic patronage. We have already encountered
Isabella d’Este, the Ferrarese-born patron and collector who was
the Marchesa of Mantua, married to Francesco Gonzaga and
mother of Eleonora, wife of the Duke of Urbino whose portrait
we considered in the previous chapter. In the late 15th and early
16th centuries, Mantua was a small but inﬂuential north Italian
town ruled by the well-respected, if not fabulously rich, Gonzaga
family. Unusually, Isabella’s artistic patronage took place while she
was a wife, not a widow. Her very active patronage of artists, as well
as her insatiable collecting habits, are extremely well documented
by the more than 20,000 letters she wrote in the ﬁve decades before
her death in 1539. From these letters, we know that, like her elite
male contemporaries, she tried to buy the best antiquities she could
afford and tried to hire the most famous artists of the day to work
for her. By the end of her life, she had amassed an impressive
collection of ancient artefacts and more ‘modern’ works such as the
gilded bronze statuette of the Apollo Belvedere that we encountered
in the fourth chapter (see Figure 15), all on what other aristocrats
would have considered a shoestring budget.
Her desire to hire ‘big name’ artists and to collect both Classical and
classicizing objects was very similar to the tastes of her elite male
contemporaries, including her own brother Alfonso d’Este, who
ruled her home town of Ferrara. However, the fact that she was not
just an elite patron, but an elite woman patron does seem to have
had an impact on her artistic commissions. For instance, while her
male contemporaries commissioned portraits that emphasized
their wisdom as well as their military and political power, as seen in
Titian’s portrait of the Duke of Urbino in armour, Isabella’s portrait
by the same artist at the age of 60 makes her look like a pretty young
girl, which suggests that beauty, more than wisdom or courage,
was the most valued trait for a woman in this period.
Gender may also have played a role in the way Isabella interacted
with the artists she hired. In fact, some scholars have criticized
Isabella for being a meddling and overly controlling patron when
84

The problems of devising appropriate images for a female patron
were perhaps even more acute for Queen Elizabeth I of England,
who was neither a wife nor a widow, but rather that most
exceptional thing of all: a single woman who was rich and powerful
all on her own. Elizabeth was nevertheless preoccupied with how to
use images effectively and appropriately to conﬁrm her legitimacy
as the rightful, Protestant heir of her father, Henry VIII, while also
striking the right balance between asserting her power and avoiding
the negative connotations Renaissance culture associated with
women who tried to rule over men. Not surprisingly, some of the
85

Did women have a Renaissance?

working with the artists she hired to decorate her studiolo and
grotta in Mantua’s Ducal Palace, the small rooms in which she
stored and displayed her collection of art and antiquities. From her
letters, we can see that she did indeed try very hard to make sure
that her artists stuck to her very detailed instructions. In the case of
Perugino, Raphael’s presumed teacher, she speciﬁed not only that
the subject of his painting should be an allegorical combat between
Erotic Love and Chaste Love, but also gave extremely precise
instructions and sent the artist a detailed drawing of what the entire
composition should look like, even going as far as sending a piece of
string to indicate exactly how tall the largest ﬁgure in the painting
should be. However, Isabella’s preoccupation with controlling
Perugino’s artistic output was not just the result of unfounded
paranoia. In the case of a painting by Andrea Mantegna showing
Venus and Mars ruling over the muses on Mount Parnassus,
Isabella did not provide such speciﬁc instructions. The result was
that some beholders apparently misinterpreted the painting by
assuming that Isabella herself was portrayed in the ﬁgure of Venus
who, although clearly supposed to be very beautiful, was also
depicted completely in the nude – not at all appropriate for a
high-ranking lady very concerned about her public image. Thus,
Isabella’s concern with keeping her artists on a short leash was
linked to the fact that, as a woman patron, she had to be particularly
careful to commission artworks that would not cause her any
scandal or embarrassment.

Renaissance Art

most important images she commissioned in the ﬁrst part of her
reign after succeeding her Catholic half-sister Mary in 1558 made
very clear references to her father and the Tudor dynasty. For
example, in a painting known as the Allegory of the Tudor
Succession, Elizabeth is led to her enthroned father by goddesses
symbolizing Peace and Plenty, ﬂanked by Henry’s by then deceased
son Edward, thus visually conﬁrming her as Henry’s legitimate
and divinely ordained heir.
Elizabethan imagery changed from the early 1580s onwards,
when it became clear that the Queen, by then in her late 40s,
would probably never marry and, more importantly, would never
produce her own heir to the throne. It was at this time that she
began to encourage her courtiers to commission paintings that
portrayed her more and more explicitly as a chaste, ever-virgin,
and always youthful queen. Like Catholicism’s favorite virgin
saint, the Madonna, whose cult the Protestant Elizabeth in
some ways tried to replace with her own, the Queen is portrayed
in a painting attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger
as a quasi-religious ﬁgure dressed in virginal white and
wearing long strands of pearls, both symbols of chastity
(Figure 24). In this portrait, Elizabeth also literally
stands on a map of England, echoing the commanding,
iconic presence her father had assumed in his own full-length
portraits.
Interestingly enough, in most cases, the Queen herself didn’t
actually pay for or commission such paintings, instead encouraging
her courtiers to serve as paymasters. For this particular portrait, the
courtier in question was probably Sir Henry Lee, owner of a grand
estate in Ditchley in the county of Oxfordshire. Signiﬁcantly,
Elizabeth stands in this portrait with her feet ﬁrmly planted on
precisely this county, and we know from documents that she even
visited Ditchley in 1592, possibly the occasion that sparked her
devoted courtier to commission the painting in the ﬁrst place. In
this image, the patron and painter also made sure they used one of
86

24. Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (attr.), Queen Elizabeth I of
England (The Ditchley Portrait), c. 1592

Elizabeth’s ofﬁcially approved templates for the monarch’s face. So,
even though Elizabeth might not have actually handed out any cash
for this particular portrait, her ultimate control over such projects
in terms of their style and iconography, coupled with the fact that
the Queen encouraged multiple replicas to be made of her favourite
portrait types, suggests that such commissions were part of a
coordinated strategy to use visual means to conﬁrm her power over
her courtiers and over the land she ruled for ﬁve decades.

Renaissance Art

Women as artists
Women, however, were not just the subjects and patrons, directly as
well as indirectly, of works of art in this period. For it is in the later
16th century that we also begin to see for the ﬁrst time professional
women artists working mainly as painters. Perhaps the earliest
known example of this phenomenon is the Bolognese painter
Lavinia Fontana, whose father Prospero was also an artist who
may well have decided to have his daughter follow in his footsteps
because he did not have a son to inherit the family business. As a
woman working in what was very much a man’s world, Lavinia
would have encountered numerous difﬁculties, but she would have
also gained some advantages from this unusual situation. So, while
she was probably unable to study the male nude from life for
reasons of propriety and decorum, thereby missing out on a
key aspect of artistic training in this period, she may well have
compensated for this by copying classicizing statuettes of male
bodies, as suggested by the small sculpted ﬁgures included in one
of her self-portraits. She also seems to have exploited her status
as a ‘wonder’, an exception to the generally held rule of female
inferiority in this period, in order to foster a demand for her skilfully
executed paintings. At the same time that she produced portraits
of male academics, prelates, and aristocrats, as well as some
large-scale religious works, Lavinia seems to have deliberately
created a kind of niche market in images made of and for well-to-do
women patrons who would have felt particularly comfortable
working with an elegant young woman artist, once again suggesting
88

Did women have a Renaissance?

25. Lavinia Fontana, Self-Portrait with a Maidservant, Keyboard,
Easel, and Cassone, 1577

that gender, properly exploited, could sometimes be a positive
advantage for a woman painter in this period.
Lavinia’s success was thus as much about creating a public image
as a unique, reﬁned, and talented woman artist as it was about the
skill and innovation actually displayed in her paintings. This very
conscious self-fashioning was visually documented in her numerous
self-portraits, including one showing her beautifully dressed
and seated like a proper gentlewoman at a clavichord with a
maidservant at her beck and call (Figure 25). This painting
89

Renaissance Art

may well have also played an important role in the preparations
made in anticipation of her marriage in 1577 to a relatively poor but
aristocratic young man. The painting was executed by Lavinia and
sent to her future in-laws in order to assure them of her social
graces, pleasing appearance, and many accomplishments, all
necessary attributes for a bride intended for a gentleman of good
breeding. Furthermore, the self-portrait could have helped to
convince her future husband that she fully intended to uphold her
side of the marriage contract, which entailed her contributing to
the family’s economic well-being through her art. Signiﬁcantly,
Fontana’s self-portrait includes an easel and a cassone – the one a
tool of her trade, the other a piece of furniture generally associated
with marriages and dowries. Without a dowry herself, Fontana was
thus demonstrating to her husband and his family by visual means
that she possessed a valuable talent that could stand in lieu of – and
perhaps could even surpass – a cash dowry.

Conclusion
Looking at such paintings – those of women, both real and
imagined, and artworks commissioned by or for women
patrons – from the point of view of gender allows us to gain a
much more sophisticated understanding of both the images
themselves and the culture in which they were produced. So,
while we can continue to debate whether women in general actually
had a ‘Renaissance’ during the Renaissance, there is no doubt that
considering the art of this period in terms of gender provides us
with new insights, as well as forces us to start asking new
questions.

90

Chapter 7
Objects and images
for the domestic sphere

The Renaissance interior
Although many museums and guidebooks seem to imply that
Renaissance art consists only of monumental masterpieces
by well-known artists, this chapter will remind us that the
vast majority of works produced in this period were actually
smaller-scale objects made by little-known or even anonymous
artists and craftsmen for speciﬁc domestic or devotional purposes.
Inventory descriptions and paintings of interiors such as those seen
in Jan van Eyck’s Arnolﬁni Portrait, Mary of Burgundy’s Book of
Hours, the Master of Frankfurt’s Portrait of an Artist and H’u Wife,
Holbein’s Ambassadors, or on the far right side of Carpaccio’s
Arrival of the English Ambassadors and St Ursula with her Father
remind us that wealthy Renaissance men, women, and children
would have been surrounded in their homes by a wide variety of
more-or-less functional decorated and decorative objects (see
Figures 8, 9, 13, 19 and 21). Listing a few of these belongings gives
us a sense of just how visually and texturally rich the interior of a
Renaissance palace, château, or wealthy citizen’s townhouse could
be: silver cutlery and platters; brightly glazed ceramics; glittering
glassware; luxurious hanging tapestries; colourful rugs imported
from the Orient; ﬁne bed linens and velvet curtains; hand-woven
and embroidered wool, silk, brocade, and lacework clothing;
precious jewels mounted in gold and silver settings; richly
91

Renaissance Art

illuminated manuscripts and, from the later 15th century
onwards, illustrated printed books in textured leather bindings;
painted panels and canvases; elaborately framed mirrors;
bronze and marble statuary (such as the bronze statuette of
the Apollo Belvedere that once belonged to Isabella d’Este
[see Figure 15]); glowing candelabra; ancient coins and newly
minted commemorative medals; beautifully crafted scientiﬁc and
musical instruments; inlaid wooden panels known as intarsia; and
decorated beds, benches, and other types of movable furnishings.
Some homes even had walls covered in embossed leather or painted
with ornamental frescos.
Today, some of the objects originally found in the homes of
wealthy Renaissance patrons are proudly exhibited on the walls
of our galleries as works of ‘Art’, while others are displayed in
special rooms or even separate museums devoted to the decorative
arts and shown as examples of more lowly craft production. But
15th- and 16th-century beholders would probably not have made
such clear-cut distinctions. Sandro Botticelli’s Primavera (Spring)
is a telling example of how what we now think of as an artistic
‘masterpiece’ might have been viewed in quite a different light
by its original Renaissance beholders (Figure 26). Although
today we would consider this painting to be priceless, its later
15th-century beholders might well have seen it instead as a
relatively cheap alternative to much more expensive tapestry wall
hangings, a suggestion supported by the fact that the painting’s
composition recalls Renaissance tapestry designs that likewise had
frieze-like groups of ﬁgures set against ﬂat, decorative backgrounds
ﬁlled with fruit, ﬂowers, and foliage. The fact that the Primavera
may have been commissioned for the wedding of a member of the
Medici family also suggests that its complex iconography may be
related to the long-standing tradition of using appropriate
allegorical and symbolic images on items made for births and
marriages. This was a practice also deployed in the decoration of
26. Sandro Botticelli, Primavera, tempera on panel, c. 1478
92

Renaissance Art

other types of household objects and furnishings, which today
we might not consider as being in the same league in aesthetic
terms as the Primavera, but which Renaissance beholders would
have understood as being part of an iconographic continuum
related to the dynastic concerns implicit in matrimony and
childbirth.
A brief examination of some of the key elements of the Primavera
supports such an interpretation. Near the centre of the composition,
we see the goddess of love, Venus, with blind-folded Cupid ﬂying
above her head, about to shoot an amorous arrow. On the right, a
pale blue male ﬁgure representing the cold North Wind tries to grab
a woman, possibly intended to represent Spring and sprouting
ﬂowers from her mouth. The female ﬁgure beside her may show
Spring once again, but now free from the wintery Wind’s clutches
and positively bursting with ﬂowers. On the left, Mercury,
messenger of the gods in Classical mythology, and the beautiful
Three Graces dancing in a circle complete the scene. Although the
precise meaning of this complicated composition continues to be
debated by scholars to this day, the fact that several of the ﬁgures
seem to be related to the themes of love, fertility, and beauty
suggests that the image may have been specially designed for a
newly wed couple keen to celebrate their marital union and to
ensure that they would produce many beautiful and healthy
children.
Other items in the homes of the wealthy were also ‘customized’ to
reﬂect the interests and concerns of their owners. For instance, the
Medici, patrons of Botticelli’s Primavera, also ordered a splendid
two-handled glazed terracotta jar from an unknown craftsman
working in the Valencia region of Spain (Figure 27). The piece’s
beautiful iridescent ﬁnish, known as ‘lustre’, was made by using a
technique that had originally been developed by Islamic artisans,
but had then been adopted by Spanish ceramicists in the 15th
century and, after 1500, was used in Italy as well. We know that this
particular example dates from the second half of the 15th century
94

since it includes the coat of arms of either Piero de’ Medici (d. 1469)
or his son Lorenzo (known as ‘The Magniﬁcent’, d. 1492) on one
side. On the other side, seen in the present reproduction, additional
Medici family emblems are visible, including a diamond ring,
which alludes to eternity, depicted in the centre of the jar against
a dark blue ground. The rest of the piece is decorated with what
may be vine leaves, most appropriate if the jar was used to
dispense wine at a Medici family feast. Even when not in use,
however, the familial symbols and the jar’s evident cost and
beauty could have been appreciated by visitors, since the object
probably would have been openly displayed in one of the
family’s palaces.
In the case of a richly gilded cassone made in c. 1455–65 (Figure
28), the coats of arms of two other Florentine families can be
seen embedded within the decorative pilasters on the left and
right sides of the chest, speciﬁcally, those of the Spinelli and,
possibly, Tanagli families. This suggests that the object was made
on the occasion of a wedding between members of these two
clans. Such chests often included painted images that attested to
their patrons’ erudition (for instance, by depicting scenes from
ancient history or Classical mythology), had allegorical or
symbolic links to marriage (as seen in illustrations of the
Triumph of Chastity), or familial signiﬁcance (as in the scene
found on the present cassone of a tournament on the square of S.
Croce in Florence, located not far from the Spinelli family’s
palace).

Birth, marriage, and Marian reliefs
Coats of arms of two families joined in marriage were also often
added to the frames or bases of sculpted images of the Madonna
and Child, such as the example shown in Figure 29, possibly designed
by Lorenzo Ghiberti and reproduced in many versions throughout
the 15th century. Marian reliefs in general form one of the largest
surviving categories of art objects from Renaissance Italy. Indeed, it

is estimated that over 1,000 examples survive to this day. Most art
historians have concentrated on using stylistic criteria to categorize
these works primarily in terms of artists’ names and dates of
production in order to establish a reliable corpus of authentic
objects – a serious concern given that many copies, replicas, and
outright forgeries of these types of reliefs were made in the 19th and
early 20th centuries. Such issues were not, however, those that
would have most concerned the original beholders of these works.
Indeed, until the end of the 15th century, most home inventories did
98

not bother to specify the authorship of such objects, which suggests
that questions of attribution were not of primary importance to
their ﬁrst owners. It is only by taking these reliefs out of the context
of traditional art historical scholarship and re-inserting them into
their original viewing circumstances that their full cultural
signiﬁcance can begin to emerge.

This type of empathetic piety, coupled with a proliferation of
humanizing images of the Madonna and Child, were important
inﬂuences on the development of the Marian relief in the
99

Objects and images for the domestic sphere

The most obvious function of such reliefs was clearly devotional.
But devotion itself, including some of its rituals and practices, was
slowly changing in this period. For instance, one can document an
increasing intensity in Marian devotion from the 12th or 13th
century onwards, coupled with a new emphasis on promoting lay
(as opposed to clerical) piety. The cult of the Virgin and growing
interest in lay piety converged in a desire to humanize Christ and
the Madonna in new kinds of texts, images, and devotional
practices. Paintings depicted sacred ﬁgures as increasingly
interactive beings, with the humanity of Jesus and Mary
emphasized through new iconographic types such as the Holy
Family or the Madonna nursing the Christ Child. New devotional
texts also encouraged readers to empathize with Christ and the
Virgin. In some cases, devotees even began to have mystic
experiences in which they actually took on the roles of the
Madonna or Christ himself. Some of these visions may have
been triggered by objects rather than by texts alone, as in the
case of life-size, wooden Christ Child dolls from the early
Renaissance. St Francis, for instance, described a miracle
in which such a doll displayed in a Christmas Nativity scene
seemed to come alive in his arms. Other documents conﬁrm
that women, including nuns, likewise sometimes imagined
that they had turned into the Virgin Mary, with the doll in their
arms similarly transformed into the real Christ Child, suckling at
the breast.

15th century. Although these reliefs took up themes found in
painted images as well, the particular qualities of sculpture as a
medium subtly changed the relationship between image and
beholder. Indeed, compared to a painting, the distance between
sacred ﬁgures and their beholders was reduced since these objects
could now become three-dimensional beings co-existing in the
same physical and psychological space as their beholders. The
fact that some of these works seem to have been handled as
though they were real ﬂesh and blood beings, for instance by
having real clothing or jewellery placed on them, lends further
support to such an interpretation. Brightly painted high-relief
terracottas depicting the Madonna and Child would have been
particularly efﬁcacious in encouraging a very corporeal type of
devotion. It is this type of art that the 15th-century theologian
Fra Giovanni Dominici may have had in mind when he
recommended that parents display sacred images for their
children to contemplate:
. . . in the house [have images] in which your child when still in
swaddling clothes may delight as being like himself . . . . The Virgin
Mary is good to have with the child on her arm . . . . A good ﬁgure
would be Jesus suckling, Jesus sleeping on his mother’s lap, [or]
Jesus standing politely before her.

This suggests that the kind of Marian imagery this particular writer
had in mind was intended primarily for relatively unsophisticated
or even uneducated beholders, including women and children.
Inventories of the 15th century conﬁrm that Marian reliefs in
general were most often displayed in bedrooms. However, in this
period, bedrooms were much more than just places to sleep. Indeed,
in many ways, the bedroom was the symbolic heart of a household,
as seen in the Arnolﬁni Portrait, in which the couple receive visitors
in a room with a canopied bed, or in Carpaccio’s painting of
St Ursula discussing her marriage prospects with her father, which
also features a similar piece of furniture as well as a framed image of
100

the Madonna and Child in paint or possibly low relief. Paintings,
prints, and home inventories suggest that bedroom images of the
Madonna and Child often had holy water receptacles or candelabra
placed before them. Other marks of respect included hanging
real jewellery or clothing on these reliefs, as mentioned above,
as well as concealing them behind protective curtains or shutters.

Renaissance marriage rites in general, as well as the objects
purchased at the time of a wedding, often focused quite explicitly
on symbolically linking a new couple’s families and asserting the
groom’s dynastic ambitions. The bonds between husbands and
wives were given permanent visual form by emblazoning both
101

Objects and images for the domestic sphere

Although the primary function of such objects would have been to
serve as aids to devotion in the domestic sphere, these works also
may have served needs that were less strictly religious. Speciﬁcally,
such images may have played an important role in addressing
Renaissance concerns about birth and marriage. An important clue
to these other functions of Marian reliefs is found in the purchasing
patterns of wealthy Florentines. Like present-day couples
‘registering’ at a big department store in anticipation of their
wedding, Renaissance couples also went on a shopping spree before
their marriage, when the groom redecorated the marital bedroom
in particular by purchasing new furnishings and art objects. Some
of the items bought at this time included cassone decorated with
fashionable historical, mythological, or allegorical subjects; deschi
da parto, or birth-trays used to bring refreshments to new mothers
resting in bed; and, signiﬁcantly, paintings and reliefs of the
Madonna and Child. Such objects obviously had a practical
function in that they could store precious textiles, carry food and
drink, or act as a focus for daily devotional prayers. But they also
could serve less obvious pedagogical or talismanic purposes, such as
seeking to reinforce contemporary beliefs about appropriate female
behaviour, as suggested by images of the Triumph of Chastity painted
on some cassone, or magically ensuring that a healthy male heir
would be born to continue the paternal line, as we shall see below.

Renaissance Art

30. Bartolomeo di Fruosino (attr.), Birth-tray with seated nude boy,

families’ coats of arms on many of the items bought for weddings
and births, including cassone, birth-trays, and Marian reliefs. In
addition to such literal familial iconography, the groom’s dynastic
aspirations may also have been alluded to in the ﬁgurative
components of Madonna and Child reliefs, speciﬁcally, in the ﬁgure
of the Christ Child himself. Renaissance culture generally placed
a very high value on the birth of male children to continue the
paternal line. Perhaps not surprisingly, depictions of male children
are often found on objects related to birth and marriage, for
instance in the Christ Child seen in Marian reliefs or in the images
of young boys painted on birth-trays like the one illustrated in
Figure 30. The talismanic or magical functions of such objects are
102

conﬁrmed by the inscription found on this particular desco da
parto, which alludes to the good fortune of having a male child
and seeks to protect women from the perils associated with
giving birth.

Thus far, we have considered Marian reliefs in terms of
contemporary devotional practices and their use as talismanic
objects associated with birth and marriage. There is, however, yet
another way to approach these images, namely, as works of art.
However, it is only towards the end of the 15th century that one
can begin to detect an interest in judging such works primarily as
aesthetic objects. For example, it is only in an inventory taken of the
contents of the Medici Palace in Florence in 1492 that we ﬁnd for
the ﬁrst time the name of a speciﬁc artist, in this case Donatello,
being associated with speciﬁc Marian reliefs, with such objects
now listed as being stored in the studiolo with other works of art,
books, and ancient artefacts, rather than hung on a bedroom wall
for primarily devotional or talismanic purposes. Even in this
inventory, however, the vast majority of such reliefs continue to
be listed without any attribution whatsoever and continue to be
displayed in bedrooms. Of course, 15th-century patrons were
103

Objects and images for the domestic sphere

How such images were believed to ‘work’ by their original owners is
best explained by contemporary ideas about sympathetic magic and
the power of the maternal imagination, ideas that can be traced
back to antiquity. A 4th-century text neatly sums up the concept:
‘the foetus is formed by the imagination of the woman during
conception; for often images and statues are desired by women, and
they bring forth similar progeny’. So, simply by having a young bride
look at a painting or, even better, a three-dimensional sculpture of
an idealized male child at the moment of conception or during
pregnancy, it was believed that she would then give birth to
similarly perfect and, equally important, male offspring to continue
her husband’s family line. The fact that appropriate images of
beautiful young boys were often located in bedrooms would,
presumably, have been particularly convenient.

certainly not oblivious to the aesthetic qualities of such reliefs.
Indeed, the existence of so many different types of Marian reliefs, in
terms of quality, design, and medium – examples exist not only in
painted terracotta, but also in marble, bronze, plaster, and glazed
terracotta – suggests that many 15th-century beholders were
sensitive to such issues. However, until the last years of the
15th century, most patrons probably would not have seen the
majority of these objects ﬁrst and foremost as works of art in
the way we understand the term today.

Renaissance Art

New genres for the domestic sphere
The growing popularity of Marian reliefs in 15th-century Italy ﬁnds
a parallel in the rise of other new artistic genres in this period that
were also made primarily for display in the domestic sphere.
As we saw in Chapter 5, independent painted portraits became
increasingly popular for an ever-widening clientele in Italy and,
especially, Northern Europe from the early 1400s onwards. A more
expensive option, ﬁrst developed in Italy, was the marble and, later,
bronze portrait bust. The former medium especially would have
reminded contemporary beholders of Classical prototypes, while
at the same time asserting the long-term dynastic ambitions of
families like the Medici and Sassetti, for whom marble portrait
busts were carved to be proudly displayed in their grand urban
palaces and which they must have hoped would survive for as long
as those of their ancient Roman predecessors.
In Northern Europe, other secular art forms likewise intended
primarily for domestic display emerged in the 16th century, in part
in reaction to the pressures of the Reformation, with its hostility to
devotional images of all types. In particular, landscape begins to
emerge as an independent genre in the early 1500s in the work of
artists like Dürer and Albrecht Altdorfer. Slightly later, paintings of
everyday life known as ‘genre scenes’ begin to be commissioned and
31. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, The Fall of Icarus, oil on canvas, c. 1555
104

Renaissance Art

collected as well. Although landscapes and genre scenes with
absolutely no discernible narrative were painted, drawn, and
printed in the 16th century, many such images, especially when
painted in oil, often had a kind of secondary or subsidiary subject
matter that becomes evident only upon closer inspection. For
instance, the mid-16th-century Flemish artist Pieter Brueghel the
Elder painted a work entitled The Fall of Icarus that incorporates
both a typical scene of country life, in which a farmer ploughs a ﬁeld
in the foreground, with a spacious land- and seascape that seems to
continue as far as the eye can see (Figure 31).
If one examines Brueghel’s painting attentively, however, one
eventually notices a tiny pair of white legs ﬂailing about in the
blue-green sea in the lower right corner of the composition,
between the ship closest to the picture plane and the shoreline.
This, as the work’s title suggests, is Icarus, son of the ancient
Greek artist-engineer Daedalus who designed for himself and his
child each a pair of enormous wings, with which they ﬂew out of
captivity on the island of Crete. Despite his father’s warnings,
however, the impetuous Icarus, convinced he could soar up to the
gods themselves, ﬂew higher and higher until, at last, he was so
close to the sun that the wax holding together the feathers of his
wings melted, sending him plunging down into the sea below to
drown, an enduring symbol of overweening ambition and pride
(literally) coming before a fall.
Brueghel’s source for this tragic tale, which gives an enigmatic
narrative focus to his landscape-genre painting, was the ancient
author Ovid. In a poem of 1938 entitled ‘Musée Des Beaux-Arts’
after the Brussels museum where the painting now hangs,
W. H. Auden eloquently described the apparent incongruity
of such epic, mythic events intruding on everyday life:
About suffering they were never wrong,
The Old Masters: how well they understood . . . .
In Brueghel’s Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
106

Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

Conclusion

107

Objects and images for the domestic sphere

In Renaissance Europe, images of mythological ﬁgures such as
Venus or Icarus, and Classical genres like the marble portrait bust
or the bronze statuette, seem to have happily co-existed in the
domestic sphere with the familial and devotional paraphernalia
of everyday life, from Marian reliefs and hanging tapestries to
decorated storage chests and wine jugs. Today, museums generally
tend to keep such ‘high’ and ‘low’ artefacts separate from one
another, but for wealthy 15th- and 16th-century beholders, these
objects would simply have been part and parcel of their daily lives.

Chapter 8
The story of a square:
art and urbanism in Florence

Setting the scene
The study of Renaissance art should not be limited to looking
at a series of autonomous, individual works isolated on the
walls of a museum or on the pages of a textbook, but rather
should be an exploration of the complex interactions between
objects and the places, patrons, beholders, and historical
circumstances that deﬁned their original contexts. In previous
chapters, we have explored Renaissance paintings, sculptures,
and other items of visual and material culture made for churches,
chapels, palaces, and the domestic sphere. In this chapter, we will
step outside into the streets and squares of Florence in order to
consider how large-scale public sculpture could also be actively
integrated into the lives and concerns of 15th- and 16th-century
beholders.
Speciﬁcally, we will focus on one public square in particular,
Florence’s Piazza della Signoria. This square, carved out
of the medieval city centre and dominated by the imposing
town hall, is still one of Florence’s most important civic spaces
and, in many respects, remains essentially unchanged from
how it looked during the Renaissance, as seen in an early
16th-century painting of the piazza by an unknown artist
(Figure 32). Here, we see on the right the town hall with its
108

tall watchtower and the ceremonial raised platform known as the
ringhiera running along its front. Further to the right, a loggia, or
vaulted arcade with three open bays, is depicted, while on the far
left edge of the composition, we can just make out part of the great
dome of Florence’s Cathedral, completed in 1436 by Brunelleschi,
as discussed brieﬂy in Chapter 4. More disturbingly, at the centre of
the square, we see a burning pyre linked by a temporary walkway to
the front corner of the town hall. Above the ﬂames, a few small
ﬁgures dangle from a tall post. These are the radical Dominican
cleric Fra Girolamo Savonarola and his companions, who were
executed at this very spot in 1498. This traumatic event was the
impetus for producing this view of the square, but for our purposes,
the space, architecture, and statuary recorded in this image are of
primary importance, rather than the gruesome end met by the overzealous friar.

Renaissance Art

During the half century between the establishment in Florence of
a patrician-dominated regime in 1382 and the rise of the Medici
family in the 1430s, an ambitious programme of urban planning
and civic statuary was undertaken around the governmental and
religious centres of the city. The streets and squares around both the
town hall and the Cathedral were widened and regularized, the
sculptor Ghiberti produced two massive decorated bronze doors for
the city’s Baptistry, and more than two dozen life-size statues by
artists such as Donatello and Nanni di Banco were prominently
installed on key buildings in central Florence, an enterprise that in
its scope and variety had probably not been seen in Europe since
antiquity. The origins of most of these structural and sculptural
programmes, however, can be traced back to the later 13th and
14th centuries, that is, well before the new oligarchic regime came
to power in 1382.

The lion on the piazza
In contrast, the very ﬁrst statue that this new government seems to
have commissioned was made for an important civic site with no
signiﬁcant pre-existing sculpture, the Piazza della Signoria, where
the recently completed loggia and the town hall that housed the
patrician rulers known as signori were located. This new statue was
a fully gilded stone sculpture depicting Florence’s symbolic lion,
the so-called Marzocco, which was placed on the corner of the
ceremonial platform in front of the town hall. The original, late
14th-century Marzocco is lost, but its appearance can be determined
from later paintings and frescos. In fact, if we look very closely
at the painting of the execution of Savonarola, we can just make
out this sculpture standing at the point where the temporary
walkway joins the ringhiera at the front corner of the town hall.
Such images suggest that the Marzocco’s basic design was quite
similar to a stone statue carved by Donatello in 1419 that eventually
replaced the ﬁrst Marzocco in front of the town hall. Donatello’s lion
crouches on its hind legs proudly holding a shield in its right front
paw decorated with Florence’s symbolic ﬂower, the lily. Instead of a
110

shield, however, the original Marzocco may have crouched over
a wolf, possibly intended to represent Florence’s long-time
rival, Siena.

The principal approach to the Marzocco was from the corner of the
Piazza della Signoria diagonally opposite the statue, where a
beholder coming from the front of the Cathedral by the most direct
route would have entered the square – in the view of the square on
the day of Savonarola’s death, this corresponds to the lower left
corner of the composition where we see a man on horseback
entering the piazza. The importance of this approach to the town
hall is underscored by the concerted efforts made in the later 1380s
to widen and regularize the street connecting the town hall and
Cathedral. Although the street wasn’t fully widened along its entire
length until the 19th century, documentary evidence suggests that
111

Art and urbanism in Florence

The century before the original Marzocco was placed in front of the
town hall was a turbulent era in the political, social, and economic
history of Florence. Bankruptcies, revolts by the labouring classes,
conﬂicts with the papacy in Rome, brief periods of tyrannical rule,
outbursts of religious fanaticism, and, in 1348, the coming of the
great plague known as the Black Death made the 14th century a
time of conﬂict and anxiety for many Florentines. These tensions
culminated in the so-called Ciompi Rebellion of 1378 in which wool
industry workers known as ciompi staged a coup and brieﬂy ruled
the city together with other members of the poorer guilds. This
regime was, in turn, overthrown in 1382 by a new coalition of
wealthier guildsmen and the city’s patrician elite. By the early
15th century, the city was effectively being run by a small inner
circle of patricians and leading members of the wealthiest guilds
that included, among others, the bankers, cloth merchants, and
wool and silk entrepreneurs. It was under the direct and indirect
supervision of this elite that the statue of the Marzocco in front of
the town hall and, in the ﬁrst decades of the 15th century, over two
dozen other large statues were prominently installed in the
governmental and religious heart of Florence.

Renaissance Art

the city’s rulers had originally planned to do so already in the
later 14th century and had hoped to coordinate the style of the
façades of the Piazza della Signoria, the buildings along the
connecting street, and the structures surrounding the Cathedral,
thereby fully integrating the centre of the city into a visually uniﬁed
complex encompassing Florence’s main civic and religious spaces.
By placing the Marzocco at the visual and symbolic focal point, or
apex, of the newly emphasized oblique approach to the town hall,
the signori would have focused the attention of the citizenry on
their own power and authority as symbolized by the lion of
Florence, the town hall behind it, and, implicitly, the rulers
themselves who inhabited this building and who were also
regularly displayed in front of it during ceremonies held on
the ringhiera.
The symbolic links between Florence’s rulers and the Marzocco
also extended well beyond the city walls. In fact, throughout the
15th century, insurgents in Florentine territory and rival powers in
central Italy equated Florence and its rulers with this lion. The
Bolognese, for example, burned straw marzocchi in their central
square to protest against the Florentine government’s interventions
into local affairs, and the Pisans, after retaking control of their city
from Florence, toppled a lion statue installed by the Florentines,
dragged it through the city streets, and then ﬁnally threw it into the
Arno River. The Florentines themselves were well aware of the
signiﬁcance of the Marzocco image and thus placed painted and
sculpted copies of this statue in the main squares of other towns
under their control. The signiﬁcance of this iconography was
appreciated even in the Florentine countryside, as suggested by a
notorious incident in which local villagers decapitated a donkey
dressed up as the Marzocco in order to express their anger towards
their big-city masters. Whether displayed on the Piazza della
Signoria or in towns under Florence’s domination, the Marzocco
thus effectively became a permanently present and ever-vigilant
symbol of the Florentine government, indeed, in certain respects,
interchangeable with the signori themselves.
112

Sculpted idols and ideals

When it was originally displayed in the Medici Palace, the statue
was meant to be understood as a fairly generic allegory of virtue
triumphing over vice. However, once it had been moved into its
new physical and political context, and a new inscription had been
added, its meaning shifted to a pointedly anti-Medicean allusion
to the victory of republicanism over autocratic tyranny. The
iconographic implications of the story of Judith must have
seemed particularly appropriate to the new government given
113

Art and urbanism in Florence

For the rest of the 15th century, no major new statuary was
commissioned for the town hall square, perhaps emblematic of the
fact that this was a period during which the powers of the signori
declined at the expense of the growing dominance of one family in
particular, the Medici, who by mid-century had effectively become
the autocratic rulers of the city. Under Lorenzo de’ Medici – known
as ‘The Magniﬁcent’ for his leadership style and lavish support
of the arts – Florence entered a brief but glorious golden age
in the second half of the century. However, things fell apart
soon after Lorenzo’s death in 1492 and, in 1494, the Medici
were overthrown and expelled from the city by a new coalition
of broadly republican forces. Less than a year later, in 1495,
Donatello’s bronze statue of Judith decapitating Holofernes
(Figure 33), which had once adorned the garden attached
to the Medici family’s grand city-centre palace, was conﬁscated
by Florence’s new rulers and placed in front of the town hall
on the ringhiera, not far from the Marzocco – one can just
make it out in the painting of Savonarola’s execution. The
statue was an immensely ambitious project, given how
complicated it must have been to cast successfully a life-size
pair of ﬁgures mounted on an integrated triangular base
decorated with relief scenes – see, for instance, Cellini’s
dramatic description of the dangers and difﬁculties
involved in casting such a work, as discussed in the ﬁrst
chapter.

33. Donatello (Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi), Judith decapitating
Holofernes, bronze, mid-15th century

But the government’s decision to appropriate the Judith for
its own political purposes soon ran into an important obstacle,
namely, the gender of its newly adopted heroine. Less than a
decade after the bronze had been installed on the ringhiera,
the Judith was literally and metaphorically removed from
the symbolic centre of Florentine civic life and replaced
by Michelangelo’s colossal marble David (Figure 34). In
January 1504, a gathering of citizens debated at length about
where to place the recently completed David, which was
originally made to be set high above ground level on one
of the Cathedral’s buttresses. The ﬁrst speaker at this meeting
was an ofﬁcial representative of the new government, the palace
herald, a certain Messer Francesco. Presumably reﬂecting
the attitudes of at least some members of the government, he
stated that:
. . . the Judith is a deadly sign and inappropriate in this place
because our [that is, Florence’s] symbol is the cross as well as the lily,
and it is not ﬁtting that the woman should slay the man, and, worst
115

Art and urbanism in Florence

the political circumstances of 1494–5. Judith, the chaste Jewish
widow who had saved her people by decapitating the dissolute
tyrant Holofernes, would have been an opportune symbol of the
new government’s claims to moral superiority in comparison to the
corruption and arrogance associated with the last years of Medici
rule in the 15th century. Like Judith, who overcame the perceived
limitations of her sex by acting like a man while slaying her enemy,
the new government had also overcome great odds in order to
triumph over the powerful Medici family and its allies. Signiﬁcantly,
Donatello’s composition shows the very moment when Judith has
triumphantly raised her sword to strike the ﬁnal blow that will sever
the head from the general’s slumped body. By relocating this
dramatic composition to the ringhiera by the town hall’s main
entrance, and by redeﬁning its civic signiﬁcance through a new
inscription, Florence’s rulers had transformed a Medicean idol into
a republican ideal.

34. Michelangelo Buonarroti, David, marble, 1504

of all, it was placed in its position under an evil constellation
because, since then, things have gone from bad to worse, and Pisa
has been lost.

By evoking the familiar Early Modern topos of the dangerous power
of women who seduce and then slaughter unsuspecting men,
Messer Francesco suggested that the town’s recent misfortunes,
including the loss of Pisa, a city it had formerly ruled, could be
blamed on the decision to display an inauspicious image of such a
dangerous woman in a public place.

In 1554, nearly half a century after the Judith had been reinstalled
on the square, she was provided with a pendant ﬁgure also made of
bronze. But this new sculpture, Cellini’s Perseus holding the head
of the Medusa (Figure 35), completely reversed the ‘woman on
top’ theme of Judith decapitating Holofernes. Instead, in the
117

Art and urbanism in Florence

The obvious solution was to reposition the statue that had so
profoundly disrupted the patriarchal order in which man is
assumed to rule over woman. Indeed, the decision to replace
the Judith with Michelangelo’s David would have provided
the new government with a much less disturbing, but equally
appropriate, allegory for the republican triumph over Medicean
tyranny. Like the tale of Judith, the story of David also involved
a most unexpected hero, in this case a mere shepherd boy,
beating the odds to overcome another evil monster, the wicked
giant Goliath. And so, Michelangelo’s iconic sculpture was
installed in front of the town hall, with Donatello’s statue
removed from the eyes of the general public by being placed
inside the building. Two years later, in 1506, the Judith was
once again allowed to be displayed on the Piazza della Signoria,
but now her symbolic deference to the triumphant David
was conﬁrmed by her placement under the far left arch of
the loggia, a much less charged location than on the ringhiera
by the town hall entrance where Michelangelo’s statue
now stood.

Perseus (whose making Cellini described in the passage quoted in
Chapter 1), it was a man who was depicted standing on top of a
decapitated female body holding aloft in one hand the Medusa’s
gory head, which had previously turned any man who dared to look
at it into stone. Cellini’s disturbing composition would therefore
have been much more in keeping with the dominant patriarchal
ideology of the period.
118

Conclusion: the return of the Medici

By effectively turning the Piazza della Signoria into a vast outdoor
sculpture gallery, the troublesome iconographic implications
of the earlier statues would thus have been transformed from antiMedicean republican propaganda into aesthetically pleasing works
of art that attested to Florence’s and, by implication, the Medici
family’s wealth, taste, and artistic brilliance. The square, in other
words, had by the later 16th century itself become a work of art, a
status it maintains to this day, overrun by tourists eager to see some
of the ‘greatest hits’ of Renaissance sculpture gathered in one
compact piazza. However, only by carefully considering the
changing physical and historical circumstances of the square and
the statues displayed within it can we begin to appreciate more fully
the links that inevitably bind the meanings of such works to their
surroundings, both spatial and temporal.

Art and urbanism in Florence

Cellini’s statue, together with several other marble mythological
ﬁgures, had been commissioned by Duke Cosimo de’ Medici after
the family’s enormously successful return from exile in 1512. By
1575, an imposing fountain crowned by a statue of Neptune had
been installed by the Medici at the corner of the town hall that was
still a key focal point of the square, thereby literally replacing the
Marzocco that recalled the pre-Medicean era with a work of the
family’s own choosing. It would have been much more difﬁcult to
remove works such as the Judith or the David, despite their even
stronger republican associations, since, by the mid-16th century,
these statues and the artists who had made them were esteemed far
and wide as some of the most spectacular examples of Florence’s
amazing artistic heritage. So, rather than unceremoniously
removing these sculptures, the Medici chose instead to
recontextualize all the statues on the square by commissioning
numerous new works by other famous artists of the day, including,
among others, Cellini and, later, the Flemish-born sculptor
Giovanni Bologna (also known as Giambologna).

Michelangelo: the birth of
the artist and of art history

New ideas about ‘Art’ and artists
Thus far, we have considered Renaissance art primarily in terms of
its location, medium, function, genre, composition, iconography,
patrons, and beholders. But the man who was probably the world’s
ﬁrst proper art historian, the 16th-century painter Giorgio Vasari,
organized his survey of Renaissance art around the biographies
of individual artists presented in chronological order, thereby
constructing an artistic canon and shaping the very discipline of art
history in ways that are still pervasive to this day. Indeed, it was only
during the Renaissance itself, in large part under the inﬂuence of
Vasari and the artist he most admired, Michelangelo, that many of
our most fondly and ﬁrmly held assumptions about artists, art, and
art history ﬁrst emerged: the concept of art-making as primarily an
aesthetic rather than a functional activity (‘art for art’s sake’); the
image of the artist as a creative and visionary genius; the idea that
art’s goal is to imitate the natural world; and the notion of
inevitable artistic ‘progress’ through the ages.
In many of the previous chapters, we considered ‘Art’ as a culturally
speciﬁc term that ﬁrst began to be used in a way that we would
recognize today during the Renaissance, especially from the later
15th century onwards. Nevertheless, many of the images and
objects that we might now consider works of art would not
120

necessarily have been understood in this way by their original
Renaissance makers and beholders. The same is true of the term
‘artist’. Nowadays, we often simply assume that organizing art
history by the names of individual artists is a perfectly natural and
normal thing to do, whether in the monographic books we buy, the
one-man exhibitions we attend, or the television documentaries we
watch. But, actually, until the Renaissance this was not at all the
norm. Indeed, as we have seen, in this period many of the objects
and images produced would have been viewed ﬁrst and foremost
in terms of their patron, function, medium, or iconography,
rather being associated with the name of the person who had
made them.

However, some aspects of this notion of the artist and, implicitly, of
artistic genius can be dated back to the Renaissance and the rise of
121

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

Our present-day view of artists, much like our current
understanding of ‘Art’, has very much been shaped by the 19th
century, for it was in this period that emphasis decisively shifted
from an artist’s skill or ability to his or her individual creativity. In
other words, there was a change from valuing an artwork as a
carefully crafted object to valuing most highly an artist’s concept or
idea and, inevitably, the related personal, biographical, and even
psychological traits that were believed to have shaped him or her.
So, ‘true’ artists were now most prized for their imagination,
inventiveness, spontaneity, and creative self-expression even if
or, better yet, especially if these traits resulted in artists leading
unconventional lives touched by a kind of creative madness.
The result was that artists were inevitably assumed to be
misunderstood, ignored, and maltreated by most of their
comparatively dull, unimaginative, and conventional
contemporaries. This is, in short, the Romantic ‘starving
artist in a garret’ model of art history – one need only think of
Vincent van Gogh, who famously never sold a single one of his
works during his lifetime and who, in a moment of madness,
cut off his own ear, before eventually committing suicide.

What’s in a name?
As we saw in the ﬁfth chapter, Dürer, the most famous artistic
superstar of the Northern Renaissance, made similar claims in his
audacious self-portrait of 1500 by visually equating his own painted
image with paintings portraying God the Father himself (see Figure
20). Dürer’s prints also highlight another aspect of the changing
status of the artist in the Renaissance. Whereas in past centuries,
artists’ names had generally not been recorded for posterity except
accidentally in contracts and similar workaday documents and had
36. Michelangelo Buonarroti, Creation of Adam, fresco, c. 1508–12
123

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

the ﬁrst art-world ‘superstars’. So, Michelangelo’s melancholic
ﬁts, brooding personality, and temper tantrums (which led to his
nose being broken in a youthful ﬁght with a fellow artist), his
astonishing creativity and artistic innovation, even his eccentric
personal habits, such as wearing his leather boots for so long
that they had to be cut off from his festering skin, all feature in
contemporary biographies and depictions of the multi-talented
artist who worked not only as a painter and sculptor, but also
as an architect and a well-respected poet. Michelangelo himself
saw his own creative powers as being divine and god-like. Not
only was he pleased to be nicknamed ‘The Divine One’ (Il Divino)
during his own lifetime, but many of the sonnets he wrote also
equated the act of artistic creation with God’s creation of Man.
In fact, one can interpret Michelangelo’s fresco of the Creation of
Adam painted in c. 1508–12 on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in
the Vatican (Figure 36) as a kind of metaphorical self-portrait
in which the life-giving touch of God’s hand is made comparable
to the artist’s own creative and generative hand. In the case
of the marble David, Vasari explicitly states that Michelangelo’s
transformation of an old, botched piece of marble begun by
another artist into an incredibly expressive ﬁgure was like
‘a miracle in restoring to life something that had been left for
dead’ (see Figure 34).

Renaissance Art

almost never appeared on individual works of art, by the 15th
century some artists had begun trying to distinguish themselves
from their artisan and craftmen brethren by signing some of their
works, as seen, for instance, in Jan van Eyck’s boldly scrawled name
on the back wall of the Arnolﬁni Portrait (see Figure 19). This trend
becomes even more apparent in the 16th century, when signatures
began to appear much more frequently on paintings, sculptures,
prints, and sometimes even drawings. Signiﬁcantly, Dürer’s name
appears prominently incised in his engraving of Adam and
Eve in the Garden of Eden (see Figure 14). Here, Adam, the ﬁrst
human created by God, holds in his hand a sign very clearly stating
‘made [faciebat in Latin] by Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg’ – but
whether it was the print or Adam himself that had been ‘made’ by
the German artist is left somewhat ambiguous, probably
intentionally so.
Absolutely unambiguous is the role played by Dürer’s name, or
rather his monogram, in one of the ﬁrst-ever incidents of artistic
copyright violation. In this case, the Italian artist Marcantonio
Raimondi copied (or perhaps one should say forged) some of
Dürer’s prints. The legal scufﬂe that ensued resulted in a decision
allowing the copies to continue being printed, but only if they
appeared without the ‘AD’ monogram. So, it was the presence or
absence of the artist’s name or monogram that seems to have been
the key point of contention – for a Renaissance super-artist like
Dürer, his monogram had apparently become something akin to
McDonalds’ golden arches or Chanel’s double ‘Cs’ today, a guarantee
of artistic quality and consistency through what we might call
‘name-branding’.
It was also precisely to eliminate any ambiguity about authorship
that Michelangelo decided belatedly to sign his name on one of his
most important early sculptures, the famous marble Pietà in the
Vatican, completed in 1499. Vasari, in his ‘Life of Michelangelo’,
describes the young artist’s anger upon hearing a loud-mouthed
Lombard claim that the work had been made by a certain Gobbo of
124

Milan. So, later that evening, Michelangelo rapidly chiselled
his name on the sash across the Virgin’s chest, thereby very
prominently and permanently ensuring that his authorship could
never again be denied.

Vasari and the emergence of art history

Vasari’s model raises as many questions as it answers. First of all, by
reading the prefaces to each of the three sections of the Lives, one
realizes that he believed the visual arts could go down as well as up
in terms of their quality, style, and ingenuity. In fact, he describes
the history of ancient art as being like the human life-cycle, in
which youth is followed ﬁrst by maturity and then, inevitably, by
decline and death. A similar trajectory is applied to the art of his
own epoch (broadly deﬁned), which begins with what he calls the
artists of the ﬁrst period, such as Giotto. Vasari believed that,
although these artists were far from perfect, they did mark the
125

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

The very idea of signing one’s work is a reﬂection of a new
understanding of the status of the artist, which ﬁrst began to be
articulated in the mid-15th century by the sculptor Lorenzo
Ghiberti in his Commentaries and was then fully expounded in
perhaps the most inﬂuential history of art ever written, Vasari’s
Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, to give the work its
full title, ﬁrst published in 1550 and then again, in a revised edition,
in 1568. Many of the approaches ﬁrst codiﬁed in Vasari’s Lives have
been, and still continue to be, the basis for how art history is
written. For instance, it is only very recently that scholars have
seriously begun to question the Vasarian notion of artistic progress,
of art apparently progressing teleologically towards some sort of
unstated but implicit goal, ﬁrst of naturalism and then of stylistic or
formal innovation for its own sake. Although Ghiberti had already
begun to develop his own preliminary model of artistic progress in
the Commentaries, it was Vasari’s grand narrative of art’s history
published a century later that became the key source of inspiration
for the next ﬁve centuries of art historical scholarship.

Renaissance Art

beginning of a new era after what he felt had been centuries of
post-Classical decadence and decay. Effectively, Vasari was giving
the artists of this ﬁrst age (who worked primarily in the 14th
century) the equivalent of a ‘best newcomer’ award, even stating
explicitly that they shouldn’t be judged by the highest standards of
art, but rather only in comparison to the ‘barbaric’ art (in Vasari’s
eyes) that had immediately preceded it. His second period covers
most of the 15th century and, although Vasari admitted that
art had improved greatly, nevertheless no artist managed to be
perfect in all aspects of art-making. To continue our school
prize-giving metaphor, then, this age would have received a
‘most improved’ award.
But no such qualiﬁcations were needed for the third period,
which encompassed his own 16th-century contemporaries who,
in Vasari’s opinion, clearly merited ‘most valuable player’ awards
or, in the case of Michelangelo, even a gold medal. Indeed,
Michelangelo, the most ‘super’ of the superstar artists, had not
only triumphed over his contemporaries, but had actually surpassed
Vasari’s two measures of perfection, namely, Classical art and the
natural world:
Michelangelo has triumphed over later artists, over the artists of
the ancient world, over nature itself, which has produced nothing,
however challenging or extraordinary, that his inspired genius, with
its great powers of application, design, artistry, judgement, and
grace, has not been able to surpass with ease.

In his ‘Life of Michelangelo’, Vasari displays both the strengths and
the weaknesses of his approach. Having introduced each of his
three sections with grand overviews of the period in question, he
then states that it was not his intention simply to compile a list of
artists and artworks. But, by using the individual artistic biography
as his basic unit of organization, it is the individual artist who
becomes the focus of attention, rather than, say, the patron or the
original function of a work – a strategy that has remained at the
126

heart of much art historical writing until quite recently, and has
often made it difﬁcult to see beyond an artist’s name when assessing
an art object. But this approach does allow Vasari to make one of
his key points, namely, that artists (including, of course, himself )
should be accorded intellectual respect and high social status by the
culture at large.

In his ‘Life of Michelangelo’, Vasari deploys many of the approaches
that still form the basis for sound art historical scholarship in the
present day by considering issues such as provenance (that is, who
the former owners of artworks were), patronage, iconography,
127

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

The ever more lofty status of the semi-divine artist, whom Vasari
was eager to distinguish from what he saw as lowly artisans and
mere craftsmen, is also suggested in the ‘Life of Michelangelo’ by
the artist’s association from an early age with the great and the good
of his time. For instance, according to Vasari, Michelangelo was
regularly invited to join the ‘Magniﬁcent’ Lorenzo de’ Medici at table
when still a boy, while as a young man, he was willing and able
to confront noblemen, cardinals, and even popes as his equals. In
this important respect, the Renaissance artist differs from his
Romantic successor: while the latter’s biography is usually
characterized by a constant stream of rejection by contemporary
society, in the case of the Renaissance super-artist, it was precisely
by demonstrating that he could interact with society’s ultimate
insiders, the members of the elite, that his high status as an
artist was conﬁrmed. For Renaissance artists like Dürer and
Michelangelo, therefore, there would have been no glory in starving
in a garret, unappreciated by their contemporaries. In fact, recent
documentary research has proven just how rich Michelangelo
actually was by the time he died, while Dürer marvelled at how well
respected he was as an artist while on a visit to Venice: ‘Here I
am a gentleman’. The Renaissance artist could, however, adopt
some of the moody eccentricities, if not the stigma of social
exclusion, associated with the stereotypical modern and, indeed,
postmodern artist.

Renaissance Art

artistic antecedents, and stylistic analysis. So, for instance, he tells
us how fragments of one of Michelangelo’s cartoons ended up in the
collection of a Mantuan nobleman, while the artist’s often stormy
interaction with his elite patrons is a topic returned to again and
again throughout the ‘Life’. Similarly, Vasari describes Michelangelo
copying the works of two of the heroes of the ﬁrst and second
sections of the book, namely, Giotto and Masaccio. Amazingly,
drawings by the young artist after both of these predecessors
survive to this day, conﬁrming Vasari’s story. But Vasari’s account
also highlights some of the potential problems of focusing so
relentlessly on an artist’s life and personality. These fairly awkward
and youthful sketches, like the cartoon fragments and other
surviving scraps mentioned by Vasari, are, the writer repeatedly
tells us, preserved like precious and holy relics. This inevitably
turns the artist into a semi-divine ﬁgure whose every stroke
of the pen or brush or chisel is worthy of quasi-religious
worship.
The problem with being elevated to the status of mortal god, of
course, is that artists can eventually start to believe their own spin.
Indeed, in the case of Michelangelo, he even hired a man named
Ascanio Condivi to write what was probably the ﬁrst ever
authorized artistic biography in order to try to gloss over claims
in the ﬁrst edition of Vasari’s Lives that seemed to undermine
Michelangelo’s own carefully constructed image as an artistic
super-hero whose genius was divinely inspired and completely
innate. Among other things, Michelangelo wanted to deny the
implication in the 1550 edition of the Lives that, rather than being
God’s gift to mankind, Michelangelo had actually had some training
in the workshop of the painter Ghirlandaio, the artist who produced
the altarpiece and frescos for the Sassetti Chapel discussed in
Chapter 3 (see Figure 10). The result was that poor Vasari, without
a doubt completely in awe of the great Michelangelo, was
nevertheless forced to provide archival evidence in the second
edition of the Lives to support his claims. In what might well be the
ﬁrst ever use of documentary evidence in art historical scholarship,
128

Vasari’s 1568 edition quotes at length from a contract signed by
Michelangelo’s father, a document that clearly refutes the artist’s
assertion that he had never had a proper teacher.

Even more common is the topos of the artist who is discovered
while tending sheep by a passerby who notices his untutored but
nevertheless impressive sketches. We see this story for the ﬁrst time
in Vasari’s ‘Life of Giotto’, in which the artist’s talent was ﬁrst
discovered by the painter Cimabue while Giotto was tending
his father’s sheep and drawing pictures of animals on stones and in
the sand. One could just about believe the story of one artistically
129

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

Vasari’s excursion into archival art history ends with the following
phrase: ‘I made this digression for the sake of truth, and it must
sufﬁce for the rest of his ‘‘Life’’.’ But this is precisely one of
the key problems of Vasari’s text, namely, that it is far from a
comprehensively documented collection of historical truths.
Although many students and even some art historians continue to
assume that Vasari’s text can be used with conﬁdence as evidence
for what ‘really’ happened, in many instances it is clear that the
Lives are as much an accumulation of hopes, desires, and myths as
any work explicitly labelled as ﬁction. Obviously, Vasari had an
agenda when writing the Lives, an agenda that centred around
raising the status of the artist and deﬁning the aim of art itself
as being to try to surpass both nature and antiquity. And it is
this agenda that underlies some of the more obviously and
self-consciously constructed elements of the Lives. For instance,
in a topos that can be traced back to Classical writers on art such
as Pliny the Elder, Vasari repeatedly claims that artistic talent can
be discovered by chance in childhood – a strategy that supports
his assertion that artistic talent is something God-given rather than
learned. So, although he insists that Michelangelo received some
training from Ghirlandaio, he also emphasizes that Michelangelo’s
innate genius was already evident long before his apprenticeship
began and that, once in the master’s workshop, he soon surpassed
his teacher.

Renaissance Art

gifted shepherd boy, but in a later section of the Lives, Vasari
tells the story of the Sienese painter Beccafumi, who is once
again described as the son of a peasant, discovered this time by a
Sienese nobleman while making drawings in the sand of the ﬂock
he was tending. Vasari gives nearly identical accounts about the
early life and discovery of Andrea Sansovino and Andrea del
Castagno as well, which simply must be more than mere
coincidence!
In a more subtle way, Vasari also employs certain motifs that echo
from one super-artist’s biography to the next. So, he tells the tale of
a young Michelangelo, who, while copying a German print of St
Anthony attacked by devils, went out and bought strangely coloured
ﬁsh to help him draw the monstrous malign spirits. Similarly, in the
‘Life of Leonardo’, Vasari claims that, again as a young boy, the
artist painted a horrible monster after gathering everything from
lizards and newts to snakes and maggots. According to Vasari,
therefore, as boys both artists used local fauna to produce
monstrous images – although, in Leonardo’s case, Vasari provides
a pungent additional detail by telling us that he became so
engrossed in drawing from his creepy-crawly models that he
didn’t even notice the disgusting stench that developed as their
carcasses started to rot.

The myth of Michelangelo
Most telling, though, is the example of Michelangelo, the
undisputed hero of Vasari’s Lives. As we saw in the ﬁfth chapter,
Michelangelo addressed a critic’s complaint that his statue of a
Medici duke did not resemble the sitter by asserting that, in a
1,000 years, no one would care what the duke had looked like,
whereas all would remember the name of the man who had carved
the sculpture. And, looking back at the Renaissance from the dawn
of the 21st century, one has to admit that he may have been right:
the cult of artistic genius and of the artistic masterpiece has
continued to grow ever since Vasari’s day. The often vicious
130

polemics generated by the recent restoration of Michelangelo’s
Sistine Chapel frescos suggest that the myth of the Renaissance
artist, ﬁrst and most fully embodied by this artist and so evocatively
described by Vasari, is alive and well and still inﬂuencing how we
assess the artworks produced in this paradigmatic period in the
history of art.

‘Before’ and ‘after’ photographs of the restored frescos, which also
included Michelangelo’s Last Judgment on the chapel’s back wall,
document the dramatic changes that took place, with the artist
transformed from the mad, bad, proto-Romantic genius of old into
a very different kind of ﬁgure indeed. A number of prominent
artists, including everyone from Andy Warhol to Robert
Rauschenberg, joined by a vocal band of art historians, argued
that the restorers were actually removing a ﬁnal set of dark glazes
Michelangelo himself had supposedly applied to the frescos in order
to increase their sense of shadowy mystery. But the very thorough
technical analysis undertaken by the restorers made it clear that the
only glazes to be found were those applied by previous restorers
who, among other things, had tried to clean the frescos centuries
earlier with stale bread and sour Greek wine.
The new Michelangelo revealed by the restoration really shouldn’t
131

Michelangelo: birth of the artist and art history

The Sistine Chapel was perhaps the most bitterly contested
programme of restoration in recent memory. There is no doubt that
some areas of paint had started to ﬂake off by 1980, when the
project got underway, and that the paintings needed to be
conserved, but the decision by the Vatican’s art curators to
undertake a complete restoration of the chapel’s mural decoration
went much further. The ﬁnal result was that, rather than the
dark, brooding genius familiar to centuries of art lovers and art
historians, a new and improved Michelangelo emerged as a much
brighter and lighter artist – literally as well as metaphorically, as
seen in the cleaned Creation of Adam reproduced in the present
volume.

Renaissance Art

have been such a great surprise. In fact, the clear, bright colours that
emerged not only would have compensated for the fact that the
frescos would have been seen from far below by beholders standing
on the ﬂoor of the chapel, often under dark lighting conditions,
but they were also very similar to those found in later 15th-century
frescoes by Florentine painters such as Ghirlandiao, the artist to
whom, as we have seen, Michelangelo himself had been apprenticed
as a boy, despite his later denials. Indeed, although the colours
aren’t exactly the same, the general palette of Michelangelo’s
cleaned Sistine Chapel frescos is quite similar to that seen in the
Sassetti Chapel. The problem, however, is that the ﬁrst glimpse
most late 20th-century beholders had of the restored frescos was
not in situ, standing on the ﬂoor of the Sistine Chapel looking up,
but rather in photographs, often taken from very close up, by the
Japanese television company that had sponsored the restoration.
This, of course, merely emphasized the almost ﬂuorescent
qualities of Michelangelo’s colours when seen completely out
of their original context.
If one keeps in mind how unrepresentative such photographs are of
the experience of actually seeing the cleaned frescos in situ, then we
can perhaps better understand just how shocking they must have
seemed to those who suddenly saw long-familiar images like the
Creation of Adam change so radically and so rapidly before their
eyes. But whatever one’s view may be of the Sistine Chapel
restoration, the very fact that it caused such controversy and
widespread public debate suggests just how enduring the Vasarian
myth of Michelangelo as a dark, mysterious, and brooding artistic
genius continues to be.

Conclusion
Clearly, it can be very difﬁcult to really ‘see’ the artists as well as the
art of 15th- and 16th-century Europe as Renaissance beholders
would have done. However, by trying to reconstruct the original
‘period eye’ that would have gazed not only on a relatively small
132

number of works by the great Michelangelo, but also on many more
images and objects produced by much less well-known or even
anonymous artists and craftsmen, we can begin to move beyond
considering only who produced a particular work of art, and instead
start to understand why and how such works were made, used, and
understood by their original Renaissance beholders.

Glossary

For artworks with unfamiliar subjects, whether religious or
mythological, readers should consult an iconographic dictionary such
as James Hall’s Subjects and Symbols in Art (John Murray, 1974).
altarpiece: a devotional image showing one or more holy ﬁgures or a
sacred narrative scene that serves as the visual focus of a Mass; some
altarpieces have wings that can be opened and closed; see also retable
altarpiece, triptych, polyptych, and predella.
anamorphosis: a deliberately distorted image that looks ‘correct’ from
one particular point of view, usually to the left or right of the
composition.
book of hours: a prayer book, often illuminated, used for private
devotion.
buttress: a supporting structure built against a wall to hold up a roof
or vault
cartoon: a full-scale drawing on a sheet of sturdy paper (known in
Italian as cartone) used to transfer the outlines of a ﬁgure or
composition onto the prepared surface of a wall, panel, or canvas.
cassone: a decorated wooden chest given to women on their marriage
and used to store clothing, bed linens, and other objects associated
with dowries.
casting: the process of making a bronze or other metallic object by
pouring molten metal into a mould; in the case of larger statues, these
are often cast as a thin shell, rather than as a solid piece of metal.
145

Renaissance Art

Ciompi: a nickname for wool industry labourers in Florence in the
14th century.
condottiere: a professional soldier-general who hired out his
services to the highest bidder.
confraternity: a club or organization based on professional or
neighbourhood ties that focuses on communal devotional activities,
social events, and charitable acts.
desco da parto (plural: deschi): literally, a ‘birth-tray’; these objects
were usually circular in shape, often decorated with scenes related to
childbirth, and used to bring food and drink to new mothers
resting in bed.
Early Modern: the historical period that began after the late Middle
Ages and extends from the Reformation in the early 16th century to
the 18th century; often used as an alternative to Renaissance.
ex-voto: an offering (often in the form of a symbolic object, small
painting, or plaque) made in thanksgiving for or in the hope of
miraculous divine assistance.
fresco: a painting on wet lime-plaster on a wall or ceiling; full-scale
designs are often transferred onto the plaster via cartoons.
frontispiece: the title page or ﬁrst illustrated page of a book or
manuscript.
gender: this term is used in the present volume to denote the social,
political, and cultural differences between the masculine and the
feminine at a particular historical moment; ‘gender’ encompasses a
wider range of meanings than does the term ‘sex’, which refers only to
biological differences between men and women.
genre: a generic type or form of art, such as an altarpiece, portrait,
landscape, or still-life painting; also used in the phrase ‘genre
paintings’ to refer to images of everyday life.
gesso: a thin, white, plaster-like layer put down as a ground on a
wooden panel or sculpture before it is painted in oil or tempera.
grotta: literally, ‘grotto’, but can also refer to a small room.
guild: an organization of merchants or craftsmen in the same
profession; artists’ guilds became less common at elite levels in Italy
in the 16th century, when they began to be superceded by ofﬁcially
sanctioned art academies.
146

147

Glossary

humanism: in the context of Renaissance Europe, an interest in
studying and reviving the art and literature of ancient Greece and
Rome; also, a focus on human individuals in general rather than on
the Divine.
iconoclasm: the deliberate destruction of images for personal, political,
or religious motives.
iconography: the subject or meaning of an image; the ‘story’ that is
being told in a narrative scene.
in situ: literally, ‘on site’; in the original location.
intarsia: wooden panels inlaid with variously coloured pieces of
wood, often forming an illusionistic still-life scene or spatial
setting.
istoria: Italian term used by Leon Battista Alberti in the mid-1430s
to refer to the narrative or story depicted in an image.
linear perspective: see perspective.
loggia: a vaulted arcade with bays open on one or more sides.

memento mori: a symbolic image or tableau designed to remind
beholders of death and their own mortality.
nave: the main body of a church, running from the entrance to
the altar and often subdivided by columns into three or more
aisles.
panel painting: a painting on wood in which the surface has been
smoothed out by a layer of gesso; either tempera or oil-based paint
can then be applied.
patron: the person who commissions and pays for a work of art or
architecture; he or she will often negotiate a detailed contract with an
artist for a particular project.
pediment: triangular structure positioned over a building’s façade (as
in Classical temples) or, on a smaller scale, over a doorway or frame;
often supported by columns or pilasters.
perspective: one-point linear perspective is a mathematically based
technique in which objects and architectural spaces are depicted on a
ﬂat surface as if seen three-dimensionally through the use of
orthogonal lines that recede to a single vanishing point; ideally, the
vanishing point is at the eye level of the beholder.

Renaissance Art

pilaster: a decorative feature that looks like a ﬂattened column and
projects only slightly from its supporting surface.
polyptych: an altarpiece with more than three main sections or panels.
predella: a series of small images, often depicting narrative events,
which is displayed below an altarpiece’s main panel(s).
pre-Lapsarian: literally, ‘before the Fall’, referring to the fall of Adam
and Eve from a state of sin-free grace once they ate forbidden fruit
from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden.
provenance: an artwork’s past owners, whether institutions or
individuals.
quadrant: an instrument that takes angular measurements of the
position of the stars and other celestial bodies, and thus can be used
in navigation.
refectory: dining room in a convent or monastery where meals are
eaten in common.
Reformation: the religious movement that began in the early 16th
century as an attempt to reform the papacy and the Rome-based
(Catholic) Church.
Renaissance: the historical period that began with the 14th-century
humanist revival in Italy and then incorporated elite culture
throughout Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries; sometimes used
interchangeably with Early Modern.
retable altarpiece: from the Latin for ‘behind the [altar] table’; a type
of painted or sculpted altarpiece generally found in Northern Europe
that consists of a central group of individual ﬁgures or, later, a single
image, in either case ﬂanked by shutter-like wings that can usually be
opened and closed; often mounted above predella-like image(s) or
reliquary containers.
ringhiera: the raised ceremonial platform in front of Florence’s
town hall.
signori: the patrician rulers of Florence in the later 14th and
15th centuries.
stigmata: according to Christian tradition, the miraculous appearance
of Christ’s wounds on the body of St Francis.
studiolo: a small room in a palace or urban town house used by elite
patrons as a study and to display and store their collections of
148

small-scale artworks, Classical artefacts, books, and exotic specimens
from the natural world.
tempera: a matte, egg-based paint applied to gesso-covered
wooden panels or sculptures; over the course of the 15th and early
16th centuries, generally replaced by oil-based paints.
topos (plural: topoi): a stock, oft-repeated subject or theme.
triptych: an altarpiece with three main sections or panels, usually
depicting one or more saintly ﬁgures.
trompe l’oeil: French phrase meaning to ‘trick the eye’; used to describe
illusionistic paintings that appear to be real.
