Preface

This book is the fruit of several years’ reﬂection about the revivals
that seem to be occurring in all the major religious traditions and
the capacity these revivals have for generating highly charged social
and political conﬂicts in a shrinking globalized world where people
of differing and competing faiths are having to live in close
proximity with each other. While recognizing that fundamentalism
is a fact of life in the 21st century – one that was illustrated in the
most spectacular way on 11 September 2001 – this introduction
seeks to untangle some of the meanings associated with the term,
despite its obvious drawbacks.
Fundamentalism originated in the very speciﬁc theological context
of early 20th-century Protestant America, and its applicability
beyond its original matrix is, to put it mildly, problematic.
Nevertheless, as I hope to show through numerous examples and
parallels, there are compelling family resemblances between
militancies or fundamentalisms in different religious traditions.
They may not add up to a coherent ideological alternative to the
triumph of liberal democracy as described by Francis Fukuyama in
his celebrated 1992 essay The End of History and the Last Man. But
they are symptomatic, I believe, of the spiritual dystopias and
dysfunctional cultural relationships that characterize the world of
what some contemporary commentators are choosing to call ‘Late
Capitalism’.

Many people, students, friends, and colleagues, contributed to this
book during its gestation. Students at Dartmouth College,
Aberdeen University, the University of California, San Diego, and at
the Colorado College helped to focus my thinking with their
questions and essays. Academic friends and colleagues, including
the late Jim Thrower, the late Albert Hourani, Hans Penner, Gene
Garthwaite, Philip Khoury, Arthur Droge, Robert Lee, Charles
Tripp, Sami Zubaida, Max Taylor, David Weddle, Ketil Volden,
Efraim Inbar, and Fred Halliday, helped stimulate my thinking by
inviting me to conferences, lectures, and seminars. I would like to
express my thanks to them all, and to Martin Marty and Scott
Appleby for inviting me to two meetings of the Fundamentalism
Project in Chicago in 1990 and 1993 which ﬁrst aroused my interest
in the subject and gave me the opportunity to meet and talk with
scholars from several disciplines and countries.
Elﬁ Pallis kindly supplied some of the information on Jewish
fundamentalism that appears in Chapter 6.

Chapter 1
Family resemblances

‘Heave an egg out of a Pullman window’, wrote H. L. Mencken, the
famous American journalist, in the 1920s, ‘and you will hit a
Fundamentalist almost anywhere in the United States today’.
‘Fundamentalism’ is a word with which everyone is familiar now.
Hardly a day passes without news of some terrorist atrocity
committed by religious militants or fundamentalists in some part
of the world. On 7 July 2005 an acquaintance was actually reading
this book on the London Underground, when a nearby carriage
exploded, killing dozens of commuters in the worst-ever terrorist
atrocity committed on British soil. Altogether, the suicide bombers
– three young British Muslim men from Leeds – succeeded in
killing 53 people in addition to themselves, while wounding
hundreds more, many of whom will be maimed for life.
‘The fact that I was reading your book when the bomb went off on
the train profoundly conditioned my thoughts in retrospect about
that experience, and much else besides’, Jonathan Williams, a
curator at the British Museum, would later write in an e-mail.
Crucially, it allowed me to realize that whatever the motive cause
was that drove these young men to kill themselves and take too
many others with them, the key context where we need to look for
understanding is not ‘Islam’, but the failure of traditional religion to
encompass modernity.
1

My views on lots of things have changed in consequence – the
exclusive truth claims of my own Christian religion for instance,
which I am still struggling with, and more parochial matters like the
Anglican Communion’s utterly distasteful obsession with issues of

Fundamentalism

sexual orientation.

The most spectacular fundamentalist atrocity of all was the suicide
hijacking on 11 September 2001 of three airliners by Islamist
militants belonging to the al-Qaeda network, whose titular head is
the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden. Nearly 3,000 people were
killed when the planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New
York and the Pentagon near Washington. The atrocity was a classic
example of the ‘propaganda of the deed’: the image of imploding
towers, symbols of Western capitalism, has been etched into public
consciousness as an icon of Islamist terror or resistance to
American hegemony, according to one’s point of view. But there
have been dozens of other atrocities blamed on fundamentalists
which have caught the headlines.

Most of them have been attributed to Muslim terrorists whose
hostility to the West, and to the United States in particular, is widely
presumed to be the outcome of their fundamentalist views. Though
far from being exclusive to Islam – Jewish, Sikh, and Hindu
extremists have been responsible for assassinating three prime
ministers – the world of Islam seems particularly prone to
religiously inspired violence at this time.

Religious fundamentalism, as it is broadly understood, has been a
major source of conﬂict since the late 1980s and early 1990s, when
the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union collapsed,
bringing the Cold War to an end with its attendant spin-offs in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. The death-toll from modern religious
conﬂicts, or conﬂicts involving religion, is formidable. Not all
these conﬂicts, perhaps, can be laid at the door of religious
fundamentalism. Local factors, including ethnicity and
nationalism, come into the picture. But religion, as a source of
motivation and identity, seems to have replaced the old ideologies of
Marxist-Leninism, national socialism, and anti-colonialism as the
principal challenge to a world order based on the hegemonic power
3

Family resemblances

Foremost among the conﬂicts attributable to fundamentalist
intransigence is the Arab-Israel dispute, still the world’s most
dangerous ﬂashpoint. For the rationally minded person, whatever
their religious background, the Middle East impasse illustrates the
pitfalls into which fundamentalist politics is driving the world.
Monotheists (who include most Jews, Christians, and Muslims)
may worship the same single transcendental deity, whether known
by the name of Jehova, the Trinity, or Allah (‘The God’ as Muslims
know Him). But when it comes to understanding His will, or
intentions, His self-proclaimed followers invariably adopt opposing
standpoints. For the secular non-believer, or for the liberal believer
who takes a sophisticated view of religious discourse, the god of
fundamentalism must be mischievous, if not downright evil, a
demonic power who delights in setting humans at each other’s
throats.

Fundamentalism

of the liberal capitalist West. Just as the contradictions within
liberalism (for example, between the universal rights of man and
the pursuit of imperial trade) gave rise to the anti-colonial
movements of the post-Second World War era, so the earliest shoots
of fundamentalism (semantically, if not as an age-old phenomenon)
came to fruition in the United States in the very heart of the
capitalist West.
Academics are still debating the appropriateness of using the Fword in contexts outside its original Protestant setting. Islamic
scholars argue that since all observant Muslims believe the Koran,
the divine text of Islam, to be the unmediated Word of God, all are
committed to a doctrine of scriptural inerrancy, whereas for
Protestants biblical inerrancy is one of the hallmarks that
distinguishes fundamentalists from liberals. If all believing
Muslims are fundamentalists in this sense of the word, then the
term is meaningless, because it fails to distinguish between the
hard-edged militant who seeks to Islamize his society and the
quietist who avoids politics completely. Higher criticism of the
Bible, based on close textual study – the original cause of the
Protestant fundamentalist revolt against liberalism and modernism
– challenged traditional teachings by claiming, for example, that
the Book of Isaiah has more than one author and that the
Pentateuch, the ﬁrst ﬁve books of the Old Testament, was not
authored by Moses himself. Higher criticism of the Koran, by
contrast, which would challenge the belief that every word
contained in the text was dictated to Muhammad by God through
the agency of the Angel Gabriel, has not been a major issue in the
Muslim world to date, though it may become so in due course, as
literary-critical theories gain ground in academic circles. The
present concerns of most Muslim fundamentalists are largely of a
different order: the removal of governments deemed corrupt or too
pro-Western and the replacement of laws imported from the West
by the indigenous Sharia code derived from the Koran and the
sunna (custom) of the Prophet Muhammad. On slightly different
grounds, scholars of Judaism point out that ‘fundamentalist’ is
4

much too broad a term when applied both to ultra-orthodox groups
known as Haredim (some of whom refuse to recognize the
legitimacy of the State of Israel) and the religious settlers of Gush
Emunim (the Bloc of the Faithful) who place more emphasis on
holding on to the Land of Israel than on observing the Halakha
(Jewish law).

Words have a life and energy of their own that will usually defy the
exacting demands of scholars. The F-word has long since escaped
from the Protestant closet in which it began its semantic career
around the turn of the 20th century. The applications or meanings
attached to words cannot be conﬁned to the context in which they
originate: if one limits fundamentalism to its original meaning one
might as well do the same for words like ‘nationalism’ and
‘secularization’ which also appeared in the post-Enlightenment
West before being attached to movements or processes in nonWestern societies. Whatever technical objections there may be to
using the F-word outside its original sphere, the phenomenon (or
rather, the phenomena) it describes exists, although no single
deﬁnition will ever be uncontested. Put at its broadest, it may be
described as a religious way of being that manifests itself in a
strategy by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their
5

Family resemblances

Fundamentalism, according to its critics, is just a dirty
14-letter word. It is a term of abuse levelled by liberals and
Enlightenment rationalists against any group, religious or
otherwise, that dares to challenge the absolutism of the postEnlightenment outlook. Other scholars argue that fundamentalism
is a caricature or mirror-image of the same post-Enlightenment
outlook it professes to oppose: by adopting the same rational style
of argument used by the secular enemy, fundamentalists repress or
bleach out the multifaceted, polysemic ways in which myth and
religions appeal to all aspects of the human psyche, not just to the
rational mind, with fundamentalists exposing what one
anthropologist calls ‘the hubris of reason’s pretence in trying to take
over religion’s role’.

Fundamentalism

distinctive identities as individuals or groups in the face of
modernity and secularization.
Bruce Lawrence, a scholar who believes that the F-word can be
extended beyond its original Protestant matrix, sees the connection
with modernity as crucial: fundamentalism is a multifocal
phenomenon precisely because the modernist hegemony, though
originating in some parts of the West, was not limited to Protestant
Christianity. The Enlightenment inﬂuenced signiﬁcant numbers of
Jews, and because of the colonization of much of Africa and Asia in
the 19th and early 20th centuries, it touched the lives and destinies
of many Muslims. In his view, the modernist hegemony did not end
with the attainment of political independence by so-called Third
World countries. Indeed, given the far-reaching consequences of
the scientiﬁc revolution that ﬂowed from the Enlightenment, the
modern predicament against which fundamentalists everywhere
are reacting has been extended to every corner of the planet.
Rather than quibbling about the usefulness of fundamentalism as
an analytic term, I propose in this book to explore its ambiguities, to
unpack some of its meanings. The word may be less than
satisfactory, but the phenomena it encompasses deserve to be
analysed. Whether or not we like the term, fundamentalist or
fundamentalist-like movements appear to be erupting in many
parts of the world, from the Americas to South-East Asia. No one
would claim that these movements, which occur in most of the
world’s great religious traditions, are identical. But all of them
exhibit what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein called ‘family
resemblances’. In explaining his analogy, Wittgenstein took the
example of games: board games, card games, ball games, Olympic
Games, and so forth. Instead of assuming that all must have a
single, deﬁning feature because of the common name applied to
them, games should be examined for similarities and relationships.
Such an examination would reveal a complicated network of
features that criss-cross and overlap: sometimes overall similarities,
sometimes similarities of detail such as one ﬁnds in different
6

members of the same family, in which build, features, colour of eyes,
gait, and temperament criss-cross and overlap in the same way.

Like many conservative American Protestants, technically known as
premillennial dispensationalists, the Stewart brothers believed that
the End Times prophecies contained in the Old Testament books of
Ezekiel and Daniel, and the Revelation of St John, the last book of
7

Family resemblances

Before proceeding to explore these resemblances, it would be useful
to recapitulate the history of the F-word and its burgeoning
semantic career. Its origins are quite revealing. Although the word
has acquired negative connotations in much of the world, it did not
begin as a term of abuse or even criticism. It appeared early in the
20th century not, as might have been expected, in the Bible Belt of
the Old South, but in southern California, one of America’s most
rapidly developing regions (in the same area and at about the same
time that one of fundamentalism’s principal bug-bears, the
Hollywood ﬁlm industry, made its appearance). In 1910 Milton and
Lyman Stewart, two devout Christian brothers who had made their
fortune in the California oil business, embarked on a ﬁve-year
programme of sponsorship for a series of pamphlets which were
distributed free of charge to English-speaking Protestant pastors,
evangelists, missionaries, theological professors, theological
students, YMCA secretaries, Sunday School superintendents,
religious lay workers, and editors of religious publications
throughout the world. Entitled The Fundamentals: A Testimony of
Truth, the tracts, written by a number of leading conservative
American and British theologians, were aimed at stopping the
erosion of what the brothers and their editors considered to be the
fundamental beliefs of Protestant Christianity: the inerrancy of the
Bible; the direct creation of the world, and humanity, ex nihilo by
God (in contrast to Darwinian evolution); the authenticity of
miracles; the virgin birth of Jesus, his Cruciﬁxion and bodily
resurrection; the substitutionary atonement (the doctrine that
Christ died to redeem the sins of humanity); and his imminent
return to judge and rule over the world.

Fundamentalism

the New Testament, refer to real (not symbolic) events that will
soon take place on the plane of human history. Drawing on a
tradition of prophecy interpretation developed by an Anglo-Irish
clergyman, John Nelson Darby (1800–82), they argued that since
many Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah were
fulﬁlled with the coming of Christ as documented in the New
Testament, other predictions, concerning the End Times, will soon
come to pass. Expecting the world to end at any moment, they saw
it as their duty to save as many people as possible before the coming
catastrophe, when sinners would perish horribly and the saved
would be raptured into the presence of Christ.
Being successful businessmen, the Stewarts wanted, and expected,
results. As Lyman wrote to Milton after learning that the American
Tobacco Company was spending millions of dollars distributing free
cigarettes in order to give people a taste for them: Christians should
‘learn from the wisdom of the world’. Theological motives were
complemented by business competition. Lyman’s principal agenda
in the oil business was ﬁghting his rival John D. Rockefeller’s
attempts to monopolize the industry. It may or may not be
coincidental that one of the ﬁrst preachers he hired came to his
attention after preaching against ‘something that one of those
inﬁdel professors in Chicago University had published’. Chicago
Divinity School, a hotbed of liberalism, had been founded and
endowed by John D. Rockefeller.
Some three million copies of The Fundamentals were circulated, on
both sides of the Atlantic. The -ist was added in 1920 by Curtis Lee
Laws, a conservative Baptist editor: Fundamentalists, he declared,
were those who are ready to do battle royal for The Fundamentals.
About half the American contributors to The Fundamentals,
including such leading lights as Reuben Torrey and Cyrus Ignatius
Scoﬁeld, were premillennialists. Before endowing The
Fundamentals, Lyman Stewart had been a major sponsor of
Scoﬁeld’s Reference Bible, ﬁrst published in 1909, and still the
preferred commentary of American premillennialists.
8

The number of premillennialist Protestants (who believe that the
Second Coming will be followed by the thousand-year reign of
Christ on earth) has been estimated conservatively at eight million.
Most American fundamentalists are premillennialists, although
there are many variations in their approaches to the Second
Coming: many of them, in the course of time, have actually become
postmillennialists, who argue that the world must be put to rights
by people before Jesus’s return. In no tradition does one ﬁnd a
complete consensus about what the fundamentals of the faith really
are. Fundamentalists are nothing if not selective about the texts
they use and their mode of interpretation. They are also much more
innovative in the way they interpret the texts they select than is
9

Family resemblances

The belief that Jesus would return to rule over an earthly kingdom
of the righteous after defeating the Antichrist dates back to the
earliest phase of Christianity, when the apostles lived in the daily
expectation of his return. Dismayed by its revolutionary potential,
which challenged the renovated imperial cults, common to both
Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Catholicism, that conferred divine
legitimacy on the Holy Roman and Byzantine emperors, the early
church fathers, notably St Augustine (354–430) allegorized and
spiritualized the coming Kingdom of God. Christian apocalyptic
became part of the everyday fabric of Christian life and belief, and
to that extent reinforced eschatological awareness by embedding it
in liturgy and preaching while distancing Catholic thought from
literalistic readings of prophecy, and especially notions of an earthly
millennium. The seal on Augustine’s teaching was set by the Council
of Ephesus in 431 which condemned millennialism and expurgated
works of earlier church fathers thought to be tainted with the
doctrine. After the Reformation loosened the Church’s grip on
Christian teaching, millennialist ideas resurfaced in such
apocalyptic movements as the Anabaptists of Münster in Germany
and Fifth Monarchy Men who took part in the English Revolution.
Transplanted to America, where constitutional separation of church
and state encourages religious innovation, millennialist ideas took
root in fertile soil.

often supposed. In this respect they may be contrasted with
traditionalists.

Fundamentalism

‘Tradition’, like ‘fundamental’, can be understood in more than one
way. Among Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and other religious
communities, the word conveys the sense of a cumulative body of
ritual, behaviour, and thought that reaches back to the time of
origins. In Catholicism especially, tradition embodying the
accumulated experience and knowledge of the Church is seen as a
source of authority equal to scripture. Tied to the exclusive
authority of the Church, tradition was afﬁrmed at the Council of
Trent (1545–63), the Church’s ofﬁcial response to the challenge
posed by the sola scriptura doctrine of the Protestant reformers.
In the Islamic tradition similar considerations apply: tradition here
means the accumulated body of interpretation, law, and practice as
developed over the centuries by the ulama, the class of learned men
who constitute Islam’s professional class of religionists or clerics.
Throughout Islamic history there have been renovators or
reformers who, like Luther, challenged the authority of the ulama
on the basis of their readings of the Sources of Islam, namely the
Koran and the Hadiths – the latter, sometimes confusingly
translated as ‘Traditions’, are canonized reports about Muhammad’s
deeds and teachings, based, it is supposed, on the oral testimony of
his contemporaries and passed down by word of mouth before
being collated into written collections. In this sense, the medieval
scholar Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1326), who ended his life in prison for
challenging the authority of the ulama and rulers of his day, was a
fundamentalist. Signiﬁcantly, his writings are extremely popular
among today’s Islamist militants.
A less specialized meaning of tradition, however, is also relevant
here. In a broader context, tradition is simply what occurs
unselfconsciously as part of the natural order of things, an
unreﬂective or unconsidered Weltanschauung (world view). In the
words of Martin Marty, most people who live in a traditional culture
10

do not know they are traditionalists. Tradition, in this sense, consists
in not being aware that how one believes or behaves is traditional,
because alternative ways of thinking or living are simply not taken
into consideration. In traditional societies, including the mainly
rural communities that formerly constituted the American Bible
Belt, the Bible was seen as comprehensively true, a source of
universal wisdom, knowledge, and authority deemed to have been
transmitted to humanity by God through the prophets, patriarchs,
and apostles who wrote the Bible. The latter was not thought of as a
scientiﬁc textbook; but nor did the ordinary pastor or worshipper
consider it unscientiﬁc. For most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the
Bible was considered compatible with reason, or at least with that
version of reason conveyed by the common-sense philosophy which
spread to North America from Scotland, along with Calvinist
theology and more or less democratic forms of church governance.

In all religions, but especially in Protestantism, the active defence of
tradition demands selectivity, since the text of the Bible is too vast
and complex to be defended in all its details.

Like any military commander, the fundamentalist had to choose the
ground on which to do battle royal with the forces of liberalism and
Higher Criticism. The Fundamentals was part of the process that
11

When Higher Criticism, originating in Germany, began to challenge
the received understandings of the Bible, for example by using
sophisticated methods of textual analysis to argue that books
attributed to Moses or Isaiah show evidence of editorial changes,
textual accumulations, and multiple authorship, or that the
doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ depended on a mistranslation
of the original Greek text, unreﬂective tradition (the received
knowledge of generations) was converted into reactive
defensiveness. From this perspective, fundamentalism may be
deﬁned as tradition made self-aware and consequently defensive. In
Samuel Heilman’s words, traditionalism is not fundamentalism,
but a necessary correlate to it:

Fundamentalism

galvanized this reaction. In America it split the more democratically
organized denominations, including Presbyterians, Baptists,
Lutherans, and Methodists, generating bitter culture-wars inside
their churches. In most of the American denominations it
represented the grass-roots reaction to the elitism of the seminaries,
perceived as being out of touch with the culture and beliefs of
ordinary believers. Yet, as Marty and Appleby point out, the very
idea behind the project revealed the distance that had already been
travelled along the path of secularity: designating
‘fundamentalisms’ automatically places the designator at a
considerable remove from the time when religion thrived as a total
way of life. To identify any one thing or set of beliefs or practices as
essential is to diminish other elements of what was once an organic
whole.
The most famous of the battles royal which tore many American
churches apart in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century was the Monkey
Trial in Dayton, Tennessee in 1925. As Garry Wills, one of
America’s best-known commentators, has explained, the trial was
something of a put-up job, engineered, in effect, by the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to challenge an obscure and
little-used Tennessee state law banning the teaching of evolution
in schools.
Many Southern states had such laws early in the 20th century. A
biology teacher, John Scopes (who subsequently admitted that he
had missed teaching the classes dealing with evolution), claimed
(rather shakily) to have broken the law. It was an early example of
what would later be known as a media event, in which the coverage
itself was more important than what actually occurred in court.
Hundreds of journalists attended, including the most famous
reporter of the day, H. L. Mencken of the Baltimore Sun. Radio
lines were brought into the courtroom, and the judge held up
proceedings to allow photographers to get their shots. The
fundamentalist defenders of the state law won the trial on points.
With a fundamentalist jury, three members of which testiﬁed that

conclusion. The state law was upheld, but Scopes had his conviction
quashed on appeal, which prevented the ACLU from pursuing its
original aim of bringing the case to a higher federal court. He went
on to become a geologist after winning a scholarship to the
University of Chicago.

2. The Scopes trial, Dayton, Tennessee, 1925

Culturally, the media battle was a devastating defeat for
fundamentalism. In a famous cross-examination before the trial
judge, William Jennings Bryan, former secretary of state and three
times Democratic candidate for the presidency, suffered public
humiliation at the hands of Clarence Darrow, the ACLU lawyer.
Cleverly drawing on literalistic interpretations of the Bible
approved of by conservatives, Darrow showed that Bryan’s
knowledge of scripture and fundamentalist principles of
interpretation was fatally ﬂawed. Afﬂicted with diabetes, Bryan
died shortly after the trial, a broken man. In the media treatment
sight was lost of the moral issues that had been his primary concern.
As a Democrat and populist, Bryan believed that German
militarism, the ultimate cause of the First World War, had been a
14

by-product of Darwin’s theory of natural selection combined with
Friedrich Nietzsche’s ideas about the human Will to Power. Given
the way in which ideas of Social Darwinism were subsequently put
to use by the Nazis, he deserves more credit than he has been given.
Shortly before the Second World War, Adolf Hitler would state in
one of his speeches: ‘[Anyone] who has pondered on the order of
this world realizes that its meaning lies in the warlike survival of the
ﬁttest.’

As Susan Harding explains, the regime of public religiosity that
prevailed in America during the mid-20th century was secular in
the limited sense, at least, that at the national-level signs of
religious partisanship were voluntarily suppressed – though it
remained for the most part incomplete, fragile, and, at times and
places, seriously contested. The triumph of liberalism in the
mainstream churches was at ﬁrst tacitly endorsed by the
fundamentalists who, for the most part, opted for the strategy of
separation from the world. Logically, premillennialists should not
care if the world goes from bad to worse, though they are charitably
enjoined to rescue as many souls as they can. According to the Book
of Revelation, the reign of the Antichrist preceding the Second
Coming will be accompanied by all sorts of portents and signs of
evil. As the saved remnant of humanity, true Christians (that is,
fundamentalists) should even welcome these signs as proof that
15

Anti-evolution laws remained on the statue books of several
American states, and indeed were extended in some cases. But for
the American public at large, fundamentalists were exposed as rural
ignoramuses, rural hillbillies out of touch with modern thought.
One of the major cultural events of 20th-century America, the
Monkey Trial precipitated what might be called the ‘withdrawal
phase’ of American fundamentalism – a retreat into the enclaves of
churches and private educational institutions, such as Bob Jones
University in South Carolina. In the mainstream academies,
seminaries, and denominations, liberal theology, which accepted
evolution as God’s way of doing things, swept the board.

Fundamentalism

salvation is imminent. ‘The darker the night gets, the lighter my
heart gets’, wrote Reuben Torrey, one of the editors of The
Fundamentals.
Fundamentalists therefore saw the contempt to which they were
exposed in the popular media after the Scopes trial as conﬁrmation
of their beliefs. The trend towards withdrawal did not mean,
however, that American fundamentalism remained static. Despite
its exclusion from the mainstream, the half-century from 1930 to
1980 saw a steady institutional growth, with numerous (mainly
Baptist) churches seceding from national denominations in order to
create an impressive national infrastructure of pastoral networks,
parachurch organizations and superchurches, schools and colleges,
book and magazine publishing industries, radio, television and
direct-mail operations that built on older institutions created during
the 19th-century revivals, such as the famous Moody Bible Institute
in Chicago. Whilst mainstream America, abetted by an increasingly
centralized media, remained unaware of what Jerry Falwell would
call the ‘sleeping giant’ in its midst, the giant itself became
progressively alarmed and annoyed at the encroachments of
permissiveness and the growing assertiveness of mainstream
secular culture.
The United States Constitution in its First Amendment
disestablishes religion and creates what would become known, in
Thomas Jefferson’s famous phrase, as ‘a wall of separation’ between
church and state. Whatever their political ambitions, American
fundamentalists are constrained by this wall, which, for historical
reasons, they are more likely than not to accept. As refugees from
what they conceived to be the religious tyrannies of the Old World,
the Protestant colonists who founded the United States in 1776 and
won its independence from Britain were opposed to any alliance
between state power and religious authority. Churches should be
self-governing, autonomous institutions free from taxation and
government interference. Nevertheless, since all of the Founding
Fathers were Protestants, modern fundamentalists can plausibly
16

argue that the United States was founded as a Christian –
speciﬁcally, Protestant – nation. For them, the wall of separation
does not mean that the state is atheist or even secular in the fullest
sense of the word: merely that it maintains a posture of neutrality
towards the different churches or denominations. However, with
waves of Catholic migrants from Ireland arriving from the 1830s
and Jewish immigration from Eastern and Central Europe from the
latter part of the 19th century, denominational pluralism was
extended far beyond what many people would have imagined
during the 1780s (though not Thomas Jefferson, who believed in
religious freedom for ‘the inﬁdel of every denomination’).

17

A landmark Supreme Court decision in 1961 extended to secular
humanists (non-believers) the legal protection accorded to
followers of religious faiths. Ironically, this is the decision which
fundamentalists now use in order to argue that secular humanism
qualiﬁes as a religion, for example when values associated with it
appear in school curricula. They argue mischievously that it should
be curbed by the state in order to maintain the ‘wall of separation’.
American fundamentalists are therefore constrained by the
pluralistic religious culture in which they must operate. Rather than
forming a religious party aimed at taking over the government, they
lobby for power and inﬂuence within the Republican Party.
Legislative successes at state level have included the reinstitution of
daily prayers in some public schools, equal time rules for the
teaching of evolution and creationism, or ‘intelligent design’ (a
thinly disguised version of creationism that appears to be more
scientiﬁc), and the overturning by a dozen or more states of the
1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade judgment repealing state bans on
abortion. At the local level, fundamentalists have lobbied for the
banning of books deemed irreligious from public school libraries or
curricula. The banned titles have included such classics as
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, William Golding’s Lord
of the Flies, and books by Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and John
Steinbeck, all of which have been seen as promoting the ‘religion’ of
secular humanism by questioning faith in God or portraying

Fundamentalism

religion negatively. These successes, however, have often been
reversed by the courts after actions by organizations such as the
ACLU and PAW (People for the American Way), a liberal lobby
group. At the national level, fundamentalism is further constrained
by the need to ﬁnd conservative partners from beyond the ranks of
Protestants.
On single issues such as abortion or the proposed amendment to
the US Constitution granting Equal Rights for women (ERA), and
the teaching of creationism or ‘intelligent design’ in schools,
fundamentalist lobbying can be efﬁcacious. (ERA failed after
‘Christian’ women were bused in their thousands to Washington.)
In the wider political domain, however, American fundamentalists
are faced with a dilemma. To collaborate with other conservative
groups they must suppress or even abandon some of their
theological objections to those – such as Mormons, Jews, or
Catholics – whose religions they regard as being false.
The world of Islam presents a somewhat different perspective. The
earliest reference to ‘fundamentalism’ in English I have found in
relation to Islam is in a letter written in May 1937 by Sir Reader
Bullard, British Minister in Jeddah, who stated that King Abd alAziz Ibn Saud has been ‘coming out strong as a fundamentalist’ by
condemning women who mix with men under the cloak of
progress. Bruce Lawrence suggests that the term ‘Islamic
fundamentalism’ was coined by H. A. R. Gibb, the well known
orientalist, in his book Mohammedanism (later retitled Islam),
with reference to Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, the pan-Islamic
reformer and political activist. Both the movements headed by Ibn
Saud and Afghani could be said to have exhibited some of
Wittgenstein’s family resemblances: both involved a radical, in
some cases an armed, defence of a religious tradition that felt itself
to be challenged or threatened by modernity. But in both cases, the
modernity in question was complicated by international politics.

Taymiyya, and Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century

Fundamentalism

Arabian reformer, were certainly fundamentalists in the way they
sought to return to the 7th-century scriptural roots of Islam,
unsupplemented by the accumulated customs, doctrines, and
traditions of subsequent centuries. Afghani, a masterful
conspirator, polemicist, and political activist, can similarly be seen
as fundamentalist in his desire to return to Islam’s pristine roots,
and in the efforts he made throughout his life to galvanize the
Muslim rulers of his day into combating British imperialism. But
far from unequivocally opposing the Enlightenment (one of the
family traits ascribed to most fundamentalist movements),
Afghani’s attitude to modernity was thoroughly ambiguous. Hating
imperialism, he nevertheless acknowledged the need for wholescale
reforms of the Muslim religion, which he saw as decadent, decayed,
and corrupt. His spirit is much closer to that of Martin Luther than
to, say, a contemporary scriptural literalist such as Jerry Falwell.
The problems of deﬁnition are compounded when so-called Jewish
fundamentalism is taken into account. As with Arabic, there is no
indigenous Hebrew word that corresponds to ‘fundamentalism’.
The term usually employed for Jewish extremists by the Israeli
media is yamina dati, the ‘religious right’. Far from rejecting
modernity, fundamentalists of the religious right such as Gush
Emunim (the Bloc of the Faithful), are religious innovators.
Whereas some traditionalist or orthodox groups known as the
Haredim regarded the establishment of Israel as an impious
pre-empting of the Messiah’s role, Gush Emunim and other
right-wing religious Zionists see the secular state as a stage towards
Redemption. If Jewish fundamentalism can embrace such
divergent alternatives, can the term be meaningful or useful?
The question, of course, is theoretical. By now it should be clear that
the meanings, or possible applications, of the F-word have strayed
far beyond the umbrella of the Abrahamic monotheisms (Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam). For example, Sikh ‘fundamentalists’ took
control of the Golden Temple of Amritsar in the Punjab, and when
Indira Gandhi sent the troops in, they murdered her in revenge.
20

Hindu ‘fundamentalists’ demolished the Babri Masjid Mosque
at Ayodhya, south-east of Delhi, in 1992, believing it to be the
birthplace of the deity Rama (Lord Ram), setting off communal
rioting that cost many thousands of lives (see Chapter 6). Buddhist
monks in Sri Lanka have taken up arms against Tamil separatists,
breaking with centuries of paciﬁsm. For their part, the mostly
secular Tamils, who developed the tactic of suicide bombing a
decade before the Palestinians, sometimes require their vanguard
squads to take an oath to the Hindu god Shiva.

Similar tensions between ideological purists who stick to the
fundamentals of their cause without compromising their principles,
21

Family resemblances

‘Fundamentalism’ now encompasses many types of activity, not all
of them religious. Critics of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) such as George Soros, the ﬁnancier, and
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Laureate, have accused the doctrinaire
policies of ‘market fundamentalism’ dominant in Washington, for
making global capitalism ‘unsound and unsustainable’ by forcing
deregulation and tight ﬁscal restraints on the economies of
developing nations, with dire consequences for the poorest sections
of society. The wing of the Scottish National Party least disposed to
cooperate with other parties in the Scottish Parliament has been
described as fundamentalist by its opponents. In Germany,
members of the Green Party who supported Joschka Fischer in
joining former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s Red-Green
coalition were described as realos (realists), in contrast to the fundis
(fundamentalists) who held true to the Party’s ideology of paciﬁsm,
opposition to nuclear power, and radical environmentalism. The
tension between the two wings was brought to breaking point when
Fischer, as Germany’s foreign minister, supported the NATO
bombing of Serbia in 1999 while his Green Party colleague,
environment minister Jürgen Trittin, was pressured into
abandoning a scheme to make car manufacturers pay for the cost of
recycling old vehicles and forced to make painful compromises in
his plans for phasing out nuclear power.

Fundamentalism

and the realists who argue that real gains can be achieved through
bargaining and compromise, exist in all political and cultural
movements; indeed, they are the very stuff of democratic politics –
the energy of political life is most often released when the ideals of
party activists are pitted against the realities of power. Virtually
every movement, from animal rights to feminism, will embrace a
spectrum ranging from uncompromising radicalism or extremism
to pragmatic accommodationism. For feminist ultras such as
Andrea Dworkin, virtually all penetrative sex is deemed to be rape.
For some animal liberationists, every abattoir, however humane its
procedures, is an extermination camp, while in the rhetoric of
radical pro-lifers such as Pat Robertson, the 43 million foetuses
‘murdered’ since Roe v. Wade are an abomination comparable to the
Nazi Holocaust.
At the borders of the semantic ﬁeld it now occupies, the word
‘fundamentalism’ strays into extremism, sectarianism,
doctrinairism, ideological purism. It seems doubtful, however, if
these non-religious uses of the word are analytically useful. There
may be some similarities in political and social psychology between,
say, anti-abortionists, animal rightists, Green Party activists,
Islamist agitators, and the Six Day Creationists (now modulated
into ‘intelligent designers’) who sit on school boards in Kansas or
southern California. A reluctance to compromise with one’s deeply
held principles is an obvious common trait. Such usages, however,
seem to me to stray beyond Wittgenstein’s family resemblances into
something closer to mere analogy. Similarity does not necessarily
imply kinship. The genetic bond that deﬁnes fundamentalism in its
more central, and useful, meaning – the fundamentalist DNA, as it
were – is sharper and more distinctive than extremism. The original
Protestant use of the word anchors it in the responses of individual
or collective selfhoods, of personal and group identities, to the
scandal or shock of the Other.
Although many religious activists (especially the evangelical
movements within Christianity and Islam) believe they have a
22

23

universal mission to transform or convert the world, all religious
traditions must face the problématique of their parochial origins,
the embarrassing fact that saviours and prophets uttered divine
words in speciﬁc languages to relatively small groups of people in
certain localities at particular moments in time. The late John
Lennon was correct in stating that the Beatles were more famous in
their time than Jesus was in his. The original social context of the
Bible, or the Koran, can never be recovered: modern Christians will
never be Galilean peasants; Muhammad’s Arab Bedouin have all
but disappeared. Religious pluralism is an inescapable feature of
modernity. It implies choice, inviting the suspicion that there may
be more than one path to salvation (perhaps even a non-religious
path). The surge of fundamentalist movements, or movements of
religious revitalization, we are witnessing in many parts of the
world is a response to globalization and, more speciﬁcally, to the
crises for believers that inevitably follows the recognition that there
are ways of living and believing other than those deemed to have
been decreed by one’s own tradition’s version of the deity.

Chapter 2
The scandal of difference

The Egyptian historian Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti (1754–1822)
wrote an account of Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 which
perfectly expresses the disdain as well as the fear experienced when
a traditional society is exposed to the brutal and outlandish
manners of outsiders. Al-Jabarti was no reactionary bigot. He
visited the Institut d’Egypte, and the outcome, the massive
23-volume Description de l’Egypte, is a monument to the science
of the Enlightenment. He was impressed by the dedication and
scholarship of the savants whom Napoleon had brought with his
train. He admitted, after observing experiments conducted by
French scientists, that ‘these are things that the minds of people like
us cannot grasp’. But their religion, or lack of it, appalled him. In his
mind, French irreligion was assimilated to that of the zindiqs
(Manichaeans) and other enemies of Islam in its earliest phases.
A similar mood, intensiﬁed by bitterness at Western support for
Israel and the suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood by the
Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdul Nasser, pervades the writings of the
Islamist ideologue Sayyid Qutb. Imprisoned and tortured by
Nasser’s police and executed in 1966 on what were almost certainly
trumped-up charges, Qutb concluded that Muslim society in the
Arab world and beyond had ceased to be Islamic, having relapsed to
the condition of jahiliyya, the paganism of the period of ignorance
that preceded the revelation of Islam. Just as God had authorized
24

The French follow this rule: great and small, high and low,
male and female are all equal. Sometimes they break this
rule according to their whims and inclinations or reasoning.
Their women do not veil themselves and have no modesty;
they do not care whether they uncover their private parts.
Whenever a Frenchman has to perform an act of nature
he does so wherever he happens to be, even in full view
of people, and he goes away as he is, without washing his
private parts . . .
(Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, Napoleon in Egypt)

More than a century and a half separates al-Jabarti’s chronicle and
the prison writings of Sayyid Qutb. Jabarti was a scholar at the
University of al-Azhar trained in the traditional Islamic sciences:
the manners and customs of the French disturbed him in the same
way that the Taliban, religious students raised in the rural madrasas
(seminaries) of northern Pakistan and southern Afghanistan, were
shocked by the appearance of unveiled women in the streets of
Kabul when they took over the city in 1996. Qutb, however, was a
member of the Egyptian intellectual elite. A protégé of the writer
Taha Hussein and the poet Abbas Mahmud al-Aqqad, leading lights

The scandal of difference

Muhammad to ﬁght the Meccan pagans before they eventually
submitted to Islam, so Qutb in his prison writings provided the
rationale that would later be used to justify the assassination of
President Anwar Sadat in October 1981, as well as the Islamist
attacks on the Egyptian and other nominally Muslim governments,
on Western personnel and tourists, and the atrocity that killed
nearly 3,000 people in New York and Washington on 11 September
2001. Though Qutb himself never explicitly advocated violence
against individuals, the myth of the jahiliyya state, supported by
the West, sustains Islamist militants from Algeria to the
Philippines.

Humanity today is living in a large brothel! One has only to
glance at its press, ﬁlms, fashion shows, beauty contests,
ballrooms, wine bars, and broadcasting stations! Or observe
its mad lust for naked ﬂesh, provocative postures, and sick,
suggestive statements in literature, the arts and the mass
media! And add to all this the system of usury which fuels
man’s voracity for money and engenders vile methods for its
accumulation and investment, in addition to fraud, trickery,
and blackmail dressed up in the garb of law.

Fundamentalism

(Sayyid Qutb)

in Egypt’s liberal Western-oriented intelligentsia, he received
government funding to study in America, where he attended
universities in Washington DC, Colorado, and California. It was
exposure to Western (particularly American) culture, not
ignorance, that led to his revulsion. His is the paradigmatic case of
the born-again Muslim who, having adopted or absorbed many
modern or foreign inﬂuences, discards them in his search for
personal identity and cultural authenticity. The term ‘fundamentalist’
may seem appropriate, but in Qutb’s case it is still problematic. Far
from espousing received theological certainties or defending
Muslim society against foreign encroachments, Qutb’s
understanding of Islam was almost Kierkegaardian in its
individualism: his authentic Muslim was one who espouses a very
modern kind of revolution against ‘the deiﬁcation of man’, against
injustice, and against political, economic, racial, and religious
prejudice.
Behind both these responses, Jabarti’s and Qutb’s, lies a particularly
Islamic response to the loss of cultural hegemony. Islam, whose
formative institutions were created during a period of historic
triumph, may be described as being ‘programmed for victory’ or
‘hard-wired for success’. Outside the Shia minority tradition which,
26

like Christianity, has myths and theologies for dealing with failure,
Islam has been a triumphalist faith. Non-Muslims were tolerated
on condition that they accepted their subordinate status. Jabarti’s
perplexity and Qutb’s rage are both responses to the scandalous fact
that the Enlightenment, with all the consequences it held for human
progress, occurred not in the Muslim world, whose scientiﬁc and
humanistic culture prepared the ground for it, but in the West, a
barbarous and, to Muslim minds, backward region whose primitive
Christian faith had been superseded by Islam, God’s ﬁnal revelation.

The fundamentalist impulse in Islam thus takes a different form
from its counterpart in Protestant Christianity, where the struggle
between fundamentalism and liberalism was for the most part
27

The scandal of difference

The crisis that normative Islam faces in its relation with the
contemporary world is partly historical. It ﬂows from the
contradiction between the collective memory of the triumphal
progress of Islam under Muhammad and his immediate successors
and the experience of recent political failure during the colonial and
post-colonial periods, when most of the Islamic world came under
Western political, cultural, and commercial domination. Outside
the Arabian peninsular, most of the world that had lived and
prospered for centuries under the imperial faith of Islam became
subject to European imperialism in some form, prompting
reformers such as Sayyid Ahmed Khan in India and Muhammad
Abduh in Egypt to ally themselves to European power in order to
try to accommodate the scientiﬁc and humanistic knowledge of the
West within the cultural norms of Islam. The result was a de facto
separation of religious and secular culture contrary to the stated
nostrums of Islamic tradition, which denied any formal distinction
between religion and the world (Arabic, din wa dunya).
Modernization (including political modernization) proceeded along
the secular path, whilst religion remained for the most part in the
custody of traditionalist ulama who (unlike their counterparts in
Protestant seminaries) avoided the challenge of modernizing the
religion from within.

Fundamentalism

waged inside the churches and the teaching institutions that served
them. In the majority Sunni tradition it is driven mainly by the
secular elites, beneﬁciaries of modern scientiﬁc and technical
educations, who wish to reintegrate the religious, cultural, and
political life of their societies along Islamic lines: the shorthand for
this aspiration is the ‘restoration of the Sharia’ (Islamic law).
Scholars make a distinction between those Islamists who put more
emphasis on voluntary Islamization from below, through preaching,
the building or taking over of state mosques, the creation of
charitable and social welfare networks, and cultural activities
including women’s halaqas (circles) or discussion groups; and
Islamization from above, involving the exercise of inﬂuence at state
level, including the take over, by revolutionary or military means, of
state power. The family resemblance to Protestant fundamentalism
may seem tenuous: but there is an underlying similarity. This is the
holistic, even totalitarian, idea of a political order governed by God.
Underlying both these visions lies a myth of the golden age when
the norms of the tradition are presumed to have held sway. Many of
the fundamentalist groups investigated by scholars subscribe to this
mythical idea of a time when the problems and conﬂicts that beset
modern society (such as drug and alcohol abuse, unregulated
sexuality, criminal behaviour, and child abuse) were deemed to be
much less prevalent than they are today. Muslim fundamentalists
tend to trace this golden age to the era of the Prophet Muhammad
and his immediate successors, the Rightly Guided Caliphs, though
in the collective imagination this era of innocence and tranquillity is
also predicated on pre-colonial times. American fundamentalists
tend to idealize the 1950s, just after the American victory in the
Second World War, before the disillusionment occasioned by the
Vietnam War and the youth rebellion of the 1960s (along with sex,
drugs, and rock and roll) set in. But like the Islamists, they also look
back to the time of origins, in this case to the American Revolution,
whose founding fathers are deemed to have been God-fearing
Christians. Hindu and Jewish fundamentalists also subscribe to
myths of a golden age. Hindus venerate the Kingdom of Ayodhya,
28

Most of the Haredim accept that it is pointless to try to impose the
Halakha on the rest of society: the state of the Jews can become a
Jewish state only when the Messiah comes. The attitude
corresponds to that of the premillennial Protestants, who see
themselves as the saved remnant of humanity pending the Return
of Jesus. Since the condition of exile is an existential one, an
alienation from the godhead which cannot be overcome by human
action, some of the Haredim do not even recognize Israel as the
Jewish homeland, although, pragmatically, they have made their
accommodations with it. Instead, they reconﬁgure themselves as
the real Jews, now in exile within the secular Zionist state. Gush
Emunim, by contrast, are future-oriented: like some radical
Islamists and postmillennial Protestants, they seek to establish
utopian society based on the rule of God.
29

The scandal of difference

whose ruler Lord Rama they wish to restore to his temple on the site
of the Babri Masjid, the mosque built by Babur, the ﬁrst Moghul
conqueror, which militants demolished in 1992. Some Jewish
fundamentalists hark back to the era of David, and to Solomon,
builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. Its restoration, like that of
Ayodhya, would necessitate the destruction of two Muslim shrines,
the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque, from where
Muhammad is supposed to have ascended to heaven. Others, such
as the Haredim and members of Hasidic orders look back to a more
recent era. Wearing the frock coats, broad-brimmed hats, and
ringlets of the 18th-century shtetels of Eastern Europe, they seek to
preserve the close-knit, Halakha-governed, autonomous
communities prior to the Jewish Enlightenment, before the
processes of modernization and secularization began. Orthodox
Jewish groups which strictly observe the Halakha had been
conditioned by a fundamentalist refusal to abandon the condition
of exile long before anti-Semitic persecutions drove them back into
the ghettos of Eastern Europe. Transplanted to Palestine after the
Holocaust by necessity rather than choice, their attitudes towards
the secular Zionist state range from formal non-recognition to de
facto collaboration.

The encounter of the world faiths is still only just beginning,
even today. There are many historical and sociological
reasons for the delay. Chief among them, no doubt, is the
understandable belief that one’s own tradition, after long
centuries of development and diversiﬁcation, contains
within itself resources varied enough to meet the needs of all
types of individual. This argument for staying within one’s
own camp is, however, vulnerable to something that we
might call religion-shock on the analogy of culture-shock.
Religion-shock occurs when someone who is a strong and
sincere believer in his own faith confronts, without evasion
and without being able to explain it away, the reality of an

Fundamentalism

entirely different form of faith, and faces the consequent
challenge to his own deepest assumptions.

In all such cases the vision is monocultural. The group or enclave it
supports rejects the pluralism and diversity which constitute one
the deﬁning characteristics of the modern world. Modernity
pluralizes, introducing choices (including religious choices) where
none existed before. Before modern forms of travel and
communications made people living in different cultural systems
aware of each other, most people assumed that their own way of life
or system of beliefs were the norm. The same considerations
applied to social life and most types of industrial activity.
Everywhere, modernity entails diversiﬁcation and specialization as
well as innovation.
For pre-modern Judaism, the barriers created by religious identity
and external hostility were mutually reinforcing. Similarly,
pre-modern Catholic Christianity enforced strict religious
conformity, and it was only after centuries of conﬂict between
30

Catholics and Protestants (and within Protestantism) – conﬂicts
that assisted the emergence of the Enlightenment – that a modus
vivendi between the two faiths was achieved.

Though fundamentalists, as we shall see, have not been slow to
embrace such aspects of modernity as they ﬁnd congenial,
especially modern technologies (including radio, television,
electronics, and armaments) they consider helpful to their cause,
they do not or cannot fully accept religious pluralism. Islamist
extremists in Upper Egypt have tried to extract the jizya tax from
the Christian Coptic minority, a payment that would symbolize
their inferior status. The Hindu fundamentalists of the BJP
(Bharatiya Janata Party) and RSS (Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh,
or ‘national union of volunteers’) believe that Indian nationhood
must be based on caste, the social categories recognized in classical
Hinduism, thus excluding Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, tribal
peoples, and even non-resident Indians (NRIs) from their notion of
Indian identity. Jewish fundamentalists tend to be narrower in their
deﬁnitions of what constitutes Jewish identity than secular Zionists.
The extremists among them, such as Baruch Goldstein, who killed
some 30 Arab worshippers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron
in 1994, and his mentor, Rabbi Meir Kahane, held views about
31

The scandal of difference

Compared to pre-Enlightenment Christendom, the record of Islam
is impressive. Pre-modern Islam formally tolerated Jews and
Christians as dhimmis, or peoples of the book entitled to Muslim
protection, a status later extended to Zoroastrians, Hindus, and
adherents of other scriptural religions. Protection, however, is not
the same as full religious tolerance. The dhimmis were not accorded
legal equality and in most Islamic societies rules affecting marriage,
legal testimony, house construction, costume, and animal transport
pointedly emphasized their inferior social status. Islamists in Egypt,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh (among other countries) have demanded
the restoration of dhimmi status to non-Muslims (including Coptic
Christians and Hindus), as well as to Muslim groups they consider
heretical, which would limit their rights as citizens.

Fundamentalism

Arabs that were remarkably similar to Adolf Hitler’s views about
the Jews. Premillennial Protestants believe that following the
imminent return of Christ those who accept the Messiah (that is,
born-again Christians, and 144,000 righteous Jews) will be
raptured into Heaven, while the unrighteous majority (including
nominal Christians and unsaved members of other religious
traditions) will perish miserably. Indeed, for many conservative
Protestants, Catholics are not Christians, Episcopalians and
Unitarians are atheists, Mormonism is a dangerous cult, while
Hinduism, Buddhism, and other non-Western religions are Satanic.
As for Islam, Jerry Falwell spoke for many American evangelicals
after 9/11 by describing Muhammad as a terrorist.
In practice, some tactical accommodations with pluralism may be
necessary, and fundamentalists who want to pursue a political
agenda (such as banning abortion or blocking the constitutional
amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women) have found it
expedient to collaborate with religious groups they regard as
heretical. In principle, however, the commands of God as
understood by the faithful are non-negotiable, absolute, and
unconditional. For Jerry Falwell, all who fail after hearing it to
accept the Christian gospel are doomed. In the Islamist view, the
same goes for the Koran and teachings of Muhammad.
Since God is reported to have said different things to the numerous
individuals claiming to speak on his behalf, belief in the truth held
by one tradition necessarily excludes all others. This is especially so
in the Abrahamic tradition of Western monotheism, where
confessions are deemed to be exclusive: in the mainstream,
orthodox versions of these faiths one cannot be a Muslim and a
Christian, or a Christian and a Jew. In a globalized culture where
religions are in daily contact with their competitors, denial of
pluralism is a recipe for conﬂict.
Yet acceptance of pluralism relativizes truth. Once it is allowed that
there are different paths to truth, a person’s religious allegiance
32

The Quran does not claim that Islam is the true compendium
of rites and rituals, and metaphysical beliefs and concepts, or
that it is the proper form of religious (as the word religion is
nowadays understood in Western terminology) attitude of
thought and action for the individual. Nor does it say that
Islam is the true way of life for the people of Arabia, or for
the people of any particular country or for the people preceding any particular age (say, the Industrial Revolution), No!
Very explicitly, for the entire human race, there is only
one way of life which is Right in the eyes of God and that is
al-Islam.
(Sayyid Abu Ala Mawdudi, The Religion of Truth)

From now on no one will leave anyone else alone. When traditional
cultures no longer feel left alone or when they want to intrude on the
other of whom they become aware, tradition ceases to be tradition in
the traditional sense of the word.

Religious pluralism, by which I mean the policy of granting public
recognition to more than one religious tradition, is as integral to
modernity as cars, aeroplanes, television, and the internet: indeed,
it is a consequence of a world where everyone is increasingly aware
of everyone else, where ‘no one leaves anyone else alone’. Since the
Reformation broke the religious monopoly of the Roman Catholic
Church in the West, pluralism has been institutionalized, and
although the process was a gradual one (with Catholics in Britain,
for example, only granted the vote in the 19th century), the spread
of pluralism has become unstoppable. The wars of religion in
Germany, culminating in the Peace of Westphalia (1648),

becomes a matter of choice, and choice is the enemy of absolutism.
Fundamentalism is one response to the crisis of faith brought about
by awareness of differences. As Clifford Geertz once put it:

Fundamentalism

established pluralism under the principle cuius regio, eius religio –
‘religion belongs to the ruler’. This was not yet toleration: rulers
retained the right to impose their religion on their subjects, with
Catholics persecuted in Protestant domains, and vice versa. But it
marked an irrevocable step in its direction. Boundaries being
porous, states acquired minorities. Though religious conformity
was rigorously enforced in countries such as France, England, and
Spain, uniformity proved unattainable. Toleration was the political
consequence of the Reformation’s challenge to the Church’s
monopoly. In due course it became a prerequisite of Enlightenment
thought, ‘an apanage of reason’, as Voltaire would call it.
Superstition and dogma, originally the targets of Protestants,
became the bugbears of all Enlightenment thinkers. For Pierre
Bayle, writing in the 1690s, God was too benevolent a being to be
the author of anything so pernicious as the revealed religions, which
‘carry in themselves the inexterminable seeds of war, slaughter and
injustice’. By the mid-18th century the deists had assimilated God to
pure reason, decoupling the deity from the religions that claimed
to speak on His behalf.
Protestant America, founded by religious refugees from Europe,
developed its own distinctive style of pluralism known as
denominationalism, becoming after the Revolution the ﬁrst polity
in the world with an explicit guarantee of religious freedom. (The
French and Russian revolutions, by contrast, were violently antireligious in their initial phases.) Jefferson’s ‘wall of separation’
between church and state was intended to prevent any one tradition
or denomination from exercising state power over the others.
American churches are privileged self-governing enclaves. They are
self-ﬁnancing, though as non-proﬁt corporations they beneﬁt from
negative subsidies since their earnings are free from tax (though
there are grey areas such as rents and property where their taxexempt status is hotly contested by government). In practice, the
divine supermarket brought into being by religious deregulation
enabled the free churches such as Baptists and Methodists
(minorities in Europe) to expand more rapidly than the more
34

In Europe religious toleration and the secularization of government
occurred more gradually, with historic state churches retaining a
degree of institutional monopoly. In Germany and Scandinavia,
churches are subsidized out of taxation; in Britain, the established
churches (Anglican in England and Wales, Presbyterian in
Scotland) are the beneﬁciaries of endowments built up over
centuries. The Catholic Church in France, Italy, and Spain is
formally separate from the state (with religion in France limited,
since 1905, to the private sphere), but it nevertheless retains a
powerful institutional presence through its educational
establishments and the symbolism of its architecture. Paradoxically,
the closer connections between church and state in Europe seem to
have facilitated the secularization of society, with regular church
attendance (as distinct from formal church membership) in rapid
decline in most European countries. In the United States, by
contrast, deregulation and the ensuing competition between
churches, the absence of an anti-clerical tradition, and the cultural
presence of Protestantism as a civil religion have combined to make
Christianity, the religion of 86% of the population, an important
35

The scandal of difference

tightly ordered churches such as the Anglicans, Congregationalists,
or Presbyterians. The latter had enjoyed state patronage during the
colonial period, with each of the Thirteen Colonies having its own
establishment: Massachusetts was Congregationalist, New York
Presbyterian, Maryland Catholic, Virginia Anglican, and so forth.
As Will Herberg observed half a century ago, the denomination is a
uniquely American creation. It is ‘the non-conformist sect become
central and normative’. It differs from the European idea of the
Church ‘in that it would never claim to be the national institution’,
but it also differs from the sect in being ‘socially established,
thoroughly institutionalised and nuclear to the society in which it is
found’. In American Christendom, the fringe becomes the centre.
Even the Roman Catholic Church became subject to the
democratizing effects of denominationalism, as the Frenchman
Alexis de Tocqueville noted on his famous visit to the United States
in 1825.

Fundamentalism

element in public life, despite (or perhaps because of )
disestablishment. In contrast to Europe, where many of the
educational, pastoral, and social functions once performed by the
church have been taken over by state authorities, America’s
churches still dispose of signiﬁcant social power. Under certain
conditions that power becomes political.
At the same time, conservative Christians (including some
Catholics and Mormons), as well as some Jews, have felt themselves
to be increasingly under attack as the state has encroached upon
areas previously considered to be the preserve of religious
communities. Throughout the United States, and not just in the
Bible Belt of Texas and the Old South, fundamentalists have taken
action in defence of their idea of a Christian America. Successive
court decisions, usually backed by mainstream liberal
denominations, have outlawed racial segregation and
discrimination against women, racial minorities, and homosexuals.
Prayer has been banned in publicly funded schools in furtherance of
church–state separation, and non-Christians of all persuasions,
including outright atheists and secular humanists, have been
accorded the legal protections the Constitution guarantees. When
these and many other developments threatened what they saw as
their freedom, fundamentalists were moved to ﬁght back. In their
view, the pluralism permitted under the Constitution was implicitly
limited to Protestant Christianity; and while it might be stretched
to include Jews and Catholics, the idea that ‘Satanic Hindus’,
‘terrorist Muslims’, or outright atheists could beneﬁt from laws
intended to preserve denominational pluralism within the
Judaeo-Christian fold was anathema.
To the scandal of difference one should add the scandal of social and
behavioural change. As Steve Bruce explains in the American
context,
one need not follow fundamentalists in their uncritical attitude to
the past, their blanket condemnation of the present, nor in their
36

explanation of the ways in which the world has changed to accept
that divorce is now common, as is drug addiction, that
homosexuality is accepted in many circles as an alternative lifestyle,
that housewife is a devalued status, that the separation of church
and state (once interpreted as denominational neutrality) is now
taken to imply secularity, and so on.

He concludes that the changes that have been promoted and
welcomed by atheists, feminists, racial minorities, and liberals have
fundamentally altered the moral, social, and political culture of
America and moved it away from the standards and practices that
fundamentalists regard as biblical.

In other countries also, the reactions generated by similar changes
can be seen as a response to the increasing intrusiveness on the part
of the state. In traditional Islamic societies before the colonial
intervention in the 19th century, the state had a watchdog role that
allowed civil society to manage itself with a minimum of political
interference. Formally the Islamic ruler, the Sultan or ‘authority’,
was subject to Islamic law, although in practice his governance
could be supplemented by royal decrees. Though the Sultan
appointed the judges, the law was interpreted and administered by
the ulama, a class of literate scholars often tied by family links to
37

The scandal of difference

From their own perspective, Christian fundamentalists may have a
point. State legislation, for example in education, has become
increasingly intrusive. First public schools were desegregated, with
bussing introduced to assist racial integration. When conservatives
responded by establishing their own independent Christian schools,
the state intervened by removing their tax-exempt status if they
appeared segregationist. It supported state legislatures which
required the licensing even of independent schools. In the media,
religious conservatives of all persuasions experienced the intrusion
of secular humanism or Godless values in such areas as the public
acceptance of nudity, homosexuality, sex outside marriage, and the
termination of pregnancies.

Fundamentalism

the merchant class. Though often thought of as harsh by modern
standards because of the use of corporal punishments for certain
categories of crime, the thrust of the law was not so much to uphold
the state as to maintain social harmony by mediating between
contending parties. Challenged by the rising power of the European
nations, reforming autocrats used their prerogative powers to
whittle away the autonomy of civil society in Muslim lands. Their
modern successors, in most cases, have continued along the same
path. In the postcolonial era the Muslim world has seen a
progressive intrusion of the state into areas hitherto reserved for
voluntary activity, including education, social welfare, industrial
production, and even the sacred arena of family life. In the Arab
world especially, nationalist regimes enthusiastically adopted the
Marxist model imported from Eastern Europe. The single-party
state, reinforced by oil monopolies, became the primary agency for
political, economic, and social mobilization, ruling by the carrot of
state patronage and stick of police repression.
Though the Jewish example differs signiﬁcantly, similar patterns
can still be observed. From its beginnings in 19th-century Europe,
the Zionist movement which culminated in the creation of Israel in
1948 was dominated by secular intellectuals. Throughout most of
the half-century of Israel’s existence the prevailing tone has been
secular and democratic. The religious parties represented in the
Knesset (the Israeli parliament) have extracted concessions from
successive governments on state funding for religious education,
exemptions from military service for yeshiva (seminary) students,
marriage and divorce, and other questions of personal status,
including the problematic question of Jewish identity (the ‘who is a
Jew?’ controversy). For a religious tradition forged during centuries
of exile, however, a state in which Jews are a majority poses special
problems. Far from permitting a relaxation of the Halakhic rules,
customs formulated under the conditions of exile are adhered to as
rigidly as they were in the diaspora.
One can discern in such paradoxes the inertia or inherent
38

39

The scandal of difference

conservatism underpinning group identities where continuity is
sustained through repetition. Ulster Protestants re-enact and
ritualize the events to which they believe they owe their religious
liberty – the Battle of the Boyne on 12 July 1690, the closing of the
Gates of Londonderry by the Apprentice Boys in August 1689.
Muslim settlers in Surinam (formerly Dutch Guyana) brought in
from Java in the 19th century still pray westwards towards Mecca,
instead of facing east, as their new location should require.
Fundamentalist movements may be grounded emotionally in
communities forged under minority conditions, where the sense of
embattlement, of being an island of virtue or faith in a sea of
ignorance or sin, is strong. But unlike sects such as the Amish, who
may be happy to be left alone in horse-drawn, zipper-free isolation,
the fundamentalism with which we are primarily concerned has
broader ambitions. Seldom content with defending its minority
status against the onslaughts of a pluralistic, secular world, it strives
to ﬁght back by exercising power, directly or indirectly. The
encroachments of modernity through state power and state
bureaucracies are pervasive and continuous and a constant
challenge to all religious traditions. For the activist fundamentalist
(as distinct from the passive traditionalist), the quest for salvation
cannot be realized by withdrawing into a cultural enclave.

Chapter 3
The snares of literalism

Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still.
(T. S. Eliot, ‘Burnt Norton’)

Fundamentalists everywhere tend towards a literalist interpretation
of the texts they revere. A survey by the Gallup organization in 1980
found that 40% of the American public claimed to believe that the
Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for
word. Similarly, most believing Muslims, not just those described as
Islamists or militants, are fundamentalist in the sense that they take
the Koran to be the literal Word of God, as dictated to the Prophet
Muhammad through the agency of the Angel Gabriel (Jibreel).
Since it was assembled by the Third Caliph Uthman (reigned 644–
656 ce) the text is considered perfect, complete, and unalterable.
For conservative Muslim scholars as for radical fundamentalists,
the style of historical criticism that sees the language of revelation
as a human construct, reﬂecting the knowledge and prejudice of its
time, is anathema. The Egyptian academic Nasr Abu Zaid, who
ventured to use modern literary critical methodology in his
approach to the Koran, was forced into exile. Higher criticism of the
40

Koran, where the text is deconstructed in accordance with methods
developed by biblical scholars since the 18th century, is still very
largely conﬁned to scholars who are not Muslims. Examples include
the work of John Wansbrough, Patricia Crone, and Gerald Hawting,
Western scholars of Islam who do not accept the traditional view of
its origins as related in the earliest texts.

At its starkest, literalism means that the letter or exact wording of a
text carries the whole weight of its meaning, excluding any
unmentioned or extraneous data. An example is a well known case
in British law. A wealthy Scot who lived in Edinburgh named in his
will the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
(NSPCC) rather than the Scottish NSPCC, an entirely different
charity – although he had shown some interest in the latter during
his lifetime. Despite the arguments of the Scottish charity’s lawyers
that the NSPCC, based in London, was unknown to the benefactor,
the Law Lords awarded the legacy to the London society on the
ground that there was no explicit indication of the benefactor’s
intention to leave it to the Scottish society.
41

The snares of literalism

There is more to literalism, however, than appears at ﬁrst sight. A
straightforward deﬁnition means reading the text at its plainest,
most obvious. For some fundamentalists that would mean, for
example, that when the Bible, in Genesis 1, tells us that God created
the world in six days and rested on the seventh, the word ‘day’
corresponds to the usual dictionary deﬁnition of a 24-hour period
(or perhaps a 12-hour period in which day is contrasted with night).
Some fundamentalist theologians, however, retreat from this
deﬁnition by arguing that since night and day as experienced by
humans are caused by the earth turning on its axis, the days prior to
the Creation can be understood to mean geological ages. In support
of this, they cite a verse from Psalm 90: ‘a thousand years in Thy
sight are like yesterday’, which shows that ‘in other passages of
scripture the word ‘‘day’’ is employed ﬁguratively of a time of
undeﬁned length’. The issue, according to the liberal theologian
James Barr, is not so much about literalism as inerrancy.

Sacred texts, however, rarely lend themselves to mechanical
literalism in this way. Fundamentalists in general avoid addressing
ambiguities of language by arguing that the plain meanings of
scriptures are an integral part of their moralizing purpose. Thus the
19th-century Protestant theologian T. H. Horne insisted that,
in common life, no prudent or conscientious person, who either
commits his sentiments to writing or utters anything, intends that a
diversity of meanings should be attached to what he writes or says;
and consequently, neither his readers, nor those who hear him, afﬁx
to it any other than the true and obvious sense.

Fundamentalism

For fundamentalists the same is supposed to apply, a fortiori, to the
writers of scripture inspired by the Holy Spirit (or, in the case of
Islam, to the words of the Koran dictated to Muhammad by God or
the agency of the angel).
Literalism, however, contains pitfalls of its own making. The
understanding of texts in their literal sense as distinct from their
mythical or allegorical meanings may open those very ﬂoodgates of
textual criticism to which fundamentalists are most adamantly
opposed. As Barr points out, the contradictions and anomalies in
the Bible were spotted not by scholars primarily concerned with its
mythological or allegorical meanings, but by literalists who paid
close attention to the plain meanings of the text.
In the 11th century ce Isaac ibn Yashush, Jewish physician to one of
the Muslim rulers in Spain, pointed out that the list of Edomite
kings in Genesis 36 named several who lived long after Moses was
supposed to have died. Thereafter early modern sceptics, including
Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza, began to note details in the
Pentateuch that seemed inconsistent with Mosaic authorship. From
the 19th century, modern source criticism saw a consensus
developing around the theme of multiple authorship. At present,
there is hardly a biblical scholar in the world actively working on
the problem who would claim that the Five Books of Moses were
42

written by Moses, or by any one person. Similar ﬁndings apply to
other Old Testament books. Textual criticism has revealed in the
New Testament a mosaic or patchwork of materials from which the
canon containing the Four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the
Epistles of Paul and Peter, and the Book of Revelation were
constructed.

Thus Maurice Bucaille, in a book popular with Islamic
fundamentalists, claims that the Koran contains references to many
scientiﬁc facts of recent discovery, such as atoms, particles, and
viruses. The perils of ‘pure’ literalism are illustrated by the famous
example of Sheikh Abdullah bin Baz, the former chief mufti of
Saudi Arabia, who on the basis of Koranic references to the ‘seven
heavens’ of the Ptolemaic system, threatened to excommunicate
anyone subscribing to the Copernican cosmology that replaced it in
the 17th century. Embarrassed by the scandal occasioned by the
worthy sheikh’s views, which the Egyptian press took pleasure in
publicizing, most Islamists now interpret the ‘seven heavens’
ﬁguratively.
In one way the sheikh’s fatwa is a benchmark in the transition from
traditionalism to fundamentalism, the point where traditionalism
becomes self-consciously reactive. Whereas the true traditionalist
43

The snares of literalism

The problématique of literalist interpretation lies in the assumption
that words can be understood separately from the hearer or reader’s
presuppositions about their context, meaning, or intent. ‘Calling a
spade a spade’ is only meaningful when one is familiar with a
certain type of garden tool – one that is now being superseded by
small tractors and other power-driven machines. The original
auditors of the scriptures or their earliest readers were people of
their times. However hard fundamentalists try to resist the thrust of
historical criticism, by insisting that God’s Word is Timeless and
Eternal, the facts alluded to in the scriptures can only be defended,
as Barr points out, by shifting the ground away from literalism and
towards inerrancy.

Fundamentalism

does not know he is a traditionalist, the fundamentalist is forced by
the logic of his desire to defend tradition into making strategic
selections. Textual anomalies are either denied, or subsumed into
the hermeneutics of inerrancy, where the burden of proof is shifted
from God to humanity. They can then be explained as errors of
human understanding, rather than ﬂaws in the text itself. Bin Baz’s
insistence after the Copernican revolution that the sun goes round
the earth is quite different from the position of the pre-Copernican
astronomers. He has in fact taken up an attitude to evidence which
the pre-Copernicans had not been able to consider, and which
would in all reasonable probability have caused them to modify
their Ptolemaic views, if they had had access to it.
By a similar logic, the doctrine of inerrancy ﬁnesses the problem
of literalism. An obvious example lies in the miracle stories that
abound in the Old and New Testaments. Far from taking the
medieval or traditionalist view of miracles, according to which God
intervenes in natural processes by causing waters to rise up, or the
sun to stand still, fundamentalist commentators tend to rationalize
miracles by suggesting that they accord with natural processes such
as earthquakes or landslides, or astronomical conjunctions. While
not denying the possibility of miracles in principle, they tend to
de-emphasize them in fact.
Some Islamic fundamentalist commentators also shy away from
strict literalism in their interpretations of the Koran. Sayyid Qutb,
the most inﬂuential of modern Sunni theorists in the Arab world, is
best known for redeﬁning the concept of jahiliyya, the age of
ignorance before the coming of Islam, in terms of the modern state,
thereby de-legitimizing it. Executed for his participation in an
alleged plot to overthrow President Gamal Abdul Nasser in 1966,
Qutb achieved a kind of posthumous revenge on the inﬁdel
government which martyred him: his resurrection of the writings of
the 13th-century Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya contributed
indirectly to the murder of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. But
while doubtless a militant, perhaps even an extremist, in his
44

‘We can only seek God in His Word’ wrote Jean Calvin, ‘nor think of
Him otherwise than according to the Word’. The cult of the text was
always implicit in Protestantism, where biblical authority
outweighed the cumulative tradition represented by the teaching
and authority of the Catholic Church. Here an important question
arises: can Catholics be fundamentalists? Given that the F-word
originated with Protestant evangelicals protesting at the
encroachments of liberal theology, does it apply to conservative
Catholics who hold similar views?
The problem is complicated, however, by a deﬁning feature of
Catholicism that is in direct contrast to the cult of the text to be
found in the Protestant and mainstream Islamic traditions: loyalty
to the Church as an institution embodying a tradition of religious
authority as important as scripture itself. The Catholic equivalent of
fundamentalism is known as intégrisme in French, integralism in
English. Until quite recently, the term fondamentalisme was not
even found in French dictionaries to refer to a religious doctrine.
Structurally, integralism is the equivalent of fundamentalism. It
45

The snares of literalism

implacable hostility to the jahiliyya state, Qutb was hardly
fundamentalist in the sense of taking a literalistic view of scripture.
The 30-volume commentary on the Koran Qutb wrote in prison is
full of a rationalist exegesis extolling the creative power of God in
nature. His position is consistent with that of several modern
Muslim writers who, like liberal Protestants, have accepted
Darwinian evolution as ‘God’s way of doing things’. There are
numerous passages in the Koran extolling Allah’s creative power
which Muslim scholars could cite as being consistent with
evolutionary theory: for example in 22: 5 Allah tells Muhammad,
‘We have created you [i.e. humanity] from dust, then from sperm,
then from a little lump of ﬂesh formed and unformed, that we may
make it clear for you.’ Following the example of Muhammad
Abduh, Muslim writers tended to read modern scientiﬁc ideas into
the Koran, while asserting that such concepts really had Islamic
roots and that nothing in the divine text contradicted them.

Fundamentalism

cares less, however, for a literalism of the book than for what one
Jesuit scholar calls ‘papal fundamentalism: a literal, ahistorical, and
nonhermeneutical reading of papal pronouncements, even papal
obiter dicta, as a bulwark against the tides of relativism, the claims
of science, and the inroads of modernity’.
A family resemblance to integralism may be found in other religious
traditions that emphasize the integrity, or divine quality, of religious
leadership – for example, among Buddhist followers of the Dalai
Lama, or Ismaili Shii followers of the Aga Khan, or some Ithnashari
Shiis loyal to the late Ayatollah Khomeini. Loyalism directed
towards an institution or person, however, even if carried to the
point of fanaticism, stands in marked contrast to the forms that
fundamentalism takes in the scripturally oriented versions of
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, where adherence to the text (or,
rather, particular interpretations of the text) supersedes traditional
forms of authority. This is especially the case in Arab Muslim
societies such as Egypt and Algeria, where the Islamist movements
are mostly led, not by members of the religious establishment
represented by the traditionally educated rabbical class of ulama,
but by religious autodidacts emerging from secondary schools and
universities. The revolt of this newly enfranchised class of
intellectuals, who usually come from rural backgrounds, has
parallels with the Reformation in Europe, which coincided with the
invention of printing and the extension of literacy into new social
strata. Similarly, the original fundamentalists who waged ‘battle
royal’ against the liberals within their own churches were in many
cases rebels within their own institutions. Catholic integralists are
constrained against rebelling by their loyalty to the leadership.
Inevitably, the strains are strongest when the leadership moves in a
liberal direction. The reforms of Vatican II (1962–5) initiated by
Pope John XXIII precipitated the secessionist movement under
Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre in France and the ‘Tradition, Property,
Family’ movement in Latin America. The reforms of Aga Khan III
(1887–1957), a radical modernizer within the Ismaili Shii tradition,
46

provoked a secession by some members of his community in East
Africa, who joined or rejoined the larger Ithnashari Shii
denomination. Buddhist communities in Tibet have suffered
divisions because of the meddling of the Chinese authorities.
However, in traditions where spiritual authority has been
sanctioned by centuries of authoritarian leadership vested in a
hereditary line of personages such as the Ismaili Imamate, or a
charismatic ofﬁce such as the papacy, secession is the exception.

Just as the Catholic Church only adopted the doctrine of papal
infallibility when liberal theology was beginning to make itself felt,
the doctrine of scriptural inerrancy only came to the fore among
Protestants when traditional understandings of scripture began to
be challenged.
As explained above, inerrancy is not the same as literalism, and may
even produce opposite conclusions. Where literalist readings may
logically lead to the deconstruction of texts, inerrancy when
pursued systematically requires textual harmonization. Since the
inerrant Bible as understood by fundamentalists is supposed to
correspond to the historical actuality of real events in real time
(as distinct from mythical events whose signiﬁcance may be
understood symbolically or spiritually), conservative commentators
47

The snares of literalism

Nevertheless there are some notable ‘family resemblances’. The
doctrine of papal infallibility adopted at Vatican I (1869–70) was a
response to the same liberal or modernizing tendencies to which the
original fundamentalists were responding during the ﬁrst two
decades of the 20th century, with papal infallibility corresponding
to biblical inerrancy. In both cases, the fundamentalists/integralists
took central orthodox symbols and highlighted or exaggerated
them, enabling them to appeal to larger constituencies within their
respective traditions. Both groups were caught up in a ‘battle royal’
against their more liberal co-religionists. Both sought to adopt
elements of modernity on their own terms, seeking to be in
modernity (and to inﬂuence its direction), but not of it.

Fundamentalism

try to edit different versions of the same stories into a coherent
narrative structure.
A well known example concerns the New Testament story of the
cleansing of the Temple by Jesus, when he threw out the moneylenders. In the synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) the
incident occurs at the very end of his ministry, at the beginning of
Passion week (the week of the Cruciﬁxion); whereas John has it
at the very beginning of his ministry. Liberal theologians may
explain the discrepancy by showing how John uses the episode to
illustrate the Gnostic theme of the ‘Word made Flesh’ that resonates
throughout the fourth Gospel. The conservative commentator
Graham Swift provides a much simpler explanation: Jesus cleansed
the Temple twice. The same methodology produces two ascensions
of Jesus into heaven, since Luke has this occur on the same day as
the resurrection whilst Acts makes it happen 40 days later, after
Jesus had appeared to the disciples. Multiple ascensions, like dual
Temple cleansings, allow both narratives to be taken literally, as real
events that happened in real time, ‘out there’ in the world. To be
avoided at all costs is the liberal position that,
there was no certain knowledge of the temporal sequence, or that
quite contradictory accounts existed, or that some source
represented the events in a particular way, not because that was the
way it happened, but because that was important for the theological
message of that particular source.

For conservative Christians, including fundamentalists, it is
important to sustain inerrancy by ironing out narrative
inconsistencies, since the Gospels themselves are literary texts that
aspire to narrative coherence. Herein lies an important difference
between the Bible and the Koran. The holy text of Islam does not
take the form of a narrative, nor is its structure chronological. The
suras (chapters) are assembled approximately in order of length,
with the shortest at the end and the longest (apart from the
Opening) at the beginning. The sequence also corresponds, very
48

roughly, to reverse chronological order: as you might ﬁnd in a
collection of letters or legal documents in a box-ﬁle, the oldest are at
the bottom, the most recent near the top.

Higher Critical scholarship of the Koran, using methodologies
adapted from biblical criticism, is still largely conﬁned to scholars
working in Western universities. So sensitive is this area for
Muslims that ‘Ibn Warraq’, a Muslim-born writer trained in Arabic
who accepts the ﬁndings of radical Western scholarship, has felt it
necessary to publish his work under a pseudonym. In the postRushdie atmosphere of cultural confrontation between Islamic and
Western worlds, criticism of the Koran demands considerably more
caution than criticism of the Bible. Even scholars working in
Western universities have been denied tenure or promotion because
of pressures from Muslim funders. Despite the pressures on critical
scholarship, the challenge of subjecting the Koran to Higher
Critical methods remains open. As with the Bible, the spotting of
apparent anomalies or contradictions in the text can lead to the
unravelling of the received understanding of the relationship
between the text and the circumstances of its appearance.
49

The snares of literalism

The Koran is presented by orthodox Islam as the very Words that
God dictated to Muhammad from the beginning of his prophetic
ministry (around 610) until his death in 632. Passages in the Koran
that refer to historical events such as the Battle of Badr,
Muhammad’s ﬁrst important victory against his pagan enemies in
634, are not self-explanatory. In order to understand the context of
such passages and to make sense of many others, later generations
of scholars had to refer to the secondary body of literature known as
the Hadith, the originally oral reports of the Prophet’s sayings and
deeds as transmitted by his contemporaries. While the Koran is
regarded by the vast majority of Muslims as the Word of God
unmediated by human authorship, arguments about the
authenticity of some individual Hadiths existed long before
Western scholars trained in biblical studies began to cast their
critical eyes upon the whole corpus.

At a rudimentary level the sceptical reader may ask how a text
presumed to have been dictated by God or an angel acting for him
contains passages (including the Opening, or Fatiha) which are
clearly prayers or invocations addressed to the Almighty. Indeed,
throughout the text there is uncertainty or ambiguity about who is
addressing whom. As Richard Bell and Montgomery Watt argue in
their scholarly Introduction to the Quran:
The assumption that God is himself the speaker in every passage
leads to difﬁculties. Frequently God is referred to in the third
person. It is no doubt allowable for a speaker to refer to himself in
the third person occasionally, but the extent to which we ﬁnd the
Prophet apparently being addressed and told about God as a third
person is unusual. It has, in fact, been made a matter of ridicule that

Fundamentalism

in the Quran God is made to swear by himself.

Aswith the Bible, there are issues about the integrity of the text of
the Koran. The early Shia sectarians believed that passages
favourable to Ali, whom they believed to have been passed over
as Muhammad’s rightful successor, were suppressed; whilst
the puritanical Kharijis (seceders), who split from the mainstream
body of Islam before even the Shia, could not believe that the
Sura of Joseph, which other scholars have seen as a positive
celebration of human sexuality, could rightfully belong in the
holy book. Such views, of course, can be dismissed as reﬂecting
the sectarian concerns of those holding them. More problematic
are archaeological difﬁculties, including the orientation of
the qibla (signalling the direction of prayer) in some of the
earliest mosques, which point towards Jerusalem rather than
Mecca.
On the basis of textual, archaeological, and non-Islamic sources
such as the writings of Christian monks, a revisionist school of
historiography based mainly in Britain and Germany has developed
the bold hypothesis that rather than arising in Arabia (as the
Koranic commentaries and biographies of Muhammad constructed
50

[The revisionist scholars] regard the whole established
version of Islamic history down at least to the time of Abd
al-Malik (685–705) as a later fabrication, and reconstruct
the Arab Conquests and the formation of the Caliphate as a
movement of peninsular Arabs who had been inspired by
Jewish messianism to try to reclaim the Promised Land.
In this interpretation, Islam emerged as an autonomous
religion and culture only within the process of a long struggle
for identity among the disparate peoples yoked together by
the Conquests: Jacobite Syrians, Nestorian Aramaeans in
Iraq, Copts, Jews and (ﬁnally) Peninsular Arabs.
(R. Stephen Humphreys, Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry)

The revisionists’ historiography cannot be expected to leave the
Koran untouched. John Wansbrough, architect of the revisionist
school, argued that the Koran and the Hadith emerged out of
sectarian controversies between Jewish and Christian monotheists
over a long period, and were then ‘projected back onto an Arabian
point of origin’. A follower of this tendency, Gerald Hawting, draws
on wide reading in the history of religions to suggest that
Muhammad’s attacks on polytheists, which are supposed to have
occurred in Mecca, actually arose much later in the course of
religious polemics between different groups of monotheists in the
Levant. As a religious system, writes Hawting, ‘Islam should be
understood as the result of an intra-monotheist polemic, in a
process similar to that of the emergence of the other main divisions
of monotheism’.
51

The snares of literalism

out of the Hadith literature relate), ‘Islam’ emerged as a new
religious tradition out of polemics conducted between different
factions of Semitic monotheists after the conquest of Palestine and
the Fertile Crescent by Arabs from the peninsular.

Fundamentalism

Is a belief in the inerrancy of scripture a precondition of
‘fundamentalism’, a deﬁning characteristic in all traditions? While
it may be true that all Christian fundamentalists are inerrantists,
the converse does not necessarily apply. Many Christian
evangelicals who are not fundamentalists believe the Bible to be
inerrant; while since the vast majority of believing Muslims are
Koranic inerrantists, Islamic fundamentalism cannot really be
deﬁned in terms of Koranic inerrancy.
Since all fundamentalists in the Western monotheist traditions,
Christianity, Islam, and (with some reservations) Judaism, may be
considered textual inerrantists, a more limited or precise deﬁnition
is needed if the Islamic radicals are to be included. The key family
resemblance is to be found neither in literalism (which, as we have
seen, is highly problematic) nor in inerrancy (much too broad) but
in a common hermeneutic style. Christian and Muslim
fundamentalists, and to a lesser degree their Jewish counterparts,
share a religious outlook which, paradoxically, has many common
features with the secularism or materialism they claim so
adamantly to oppose. Rather than calling it ‘literalist’, I would
prefer to describe this style as factualist or historicist.
In her discussion about fundamentalism in The Battle for God,
Karen Armstrong explains the prevalence of fundamentalism in the
three major Western religious traditions by suggesting that two
sources of knowledge that were kept apart in pre-modern times,
mythos and logos, the respective preserves of timelessness and
constancy, have collapsed under the inﬂuence of modern religious
ideologues, many of whom are trained in the ‘hard’ or applied
sciences. They read religious texts as blueprints for practical action.
In pre-modern times, according to Armstrong, people
evolved two ways of thinking, speaking and acquiring knowledge,
which scholars have called mythos and logos. Both were essential;
they were regarded as complementary ways of arriving at truth, and
each had its separate area of competence.
52

The old ideal had been to keep mythos and logos separate: political
action was the preserve of reason.
The implication of Armstrong’s analysis is that people in
pre-modern societies were somehow less prone to take action on
the basis of mythical ideas than in modern societies, while begging
the question of what constitutes the modern. Her argument ﬂies
in the face of historical evidence that many pre-moderns
(howsoever deﬁned) enacted their myths in rational terms: the early
conquests of Islam and the development of Islamic law, not to
mention several eschatologically oriented movements throughout
Islamic history, or similar movements in the history of Christianity
and Judaism, furnish numerous examples.

Although on the face of it fundamentalist movements, with their
highly authoritarian character, seem to run counter to this trend,
53

The snares of literalism

A more fruitful approach to modern fundamentalisms would focus
on the empowering dimensions of myths as self-validating
expressions of the sacred in a pluralistic world in which real power
and authority have become diffused and anonymous. As the
sociologist Anthony Giddens reminds us, modernity is not so much
characterized by faith in science (which, as the philosopher Karl
Popper pointed out, always rests on shifting sands) but on trust in
such anonymous abstract systems as the banking system or the
depersonalized interactions between engineers, mechanics, pilots,
and air trafﬁc controllers that keep passenger jets ﬂying. Trust in
abstract systems provides for the reliability of day-to-day living, but
by its very nature cannot supply either the mutuality or intimacy
offered by relations of personal trust. The latter, as Giddens points
out, can only be established through a process of self-enquiry since
trust between individuals is based on mutual self-disclosure. The
discovery of oneself becomes a project directly involved with the
reﬂexivity of modernity. Hence in the United States, Buddhism,
Suﬁsm, and other religious traditions centred on ‘discovery of the
inner self’ have become popular religious options.

Fundamentalism

closer inspection suggests there may be more similarity between
modern ‘fundamentalisms’ and New Age cults or new religious
movements than many observers suppose. Both provide sources of
authority in a global environment where actual power is diffused
and impersonal. Both can provide psychological reassurance in a
world in which areas of relative security interlace with radical doubt
and with disquieting scenarios of risk. Not all fundamentalist
movements are political. Fundamentalist engagement in politics
usually has local causes, not the least of which is the pursuit of
power or inﬂuence by groups which consider themselves to have
been disenfranchised politically or culturally.
While I would question Armstrong’s assumption that pre-moderns
always kept mythos and logos in balance, her point about the
literalism, or rather the factualism, with which modern religious
ideologues treat scripture, as manuals for practical action, as
distinct from sources of personal inspiration or moral guidance, is
well made. Research reveals that the majority of Islamist activists,
including the civil engineer Osama bin Laden and the architect
Mohamed Atta, are drawn not from people trained in theology or
religious studies, but from the ranks of graduates in modern
faculties such as medicine or engineering who combine a
sophisticated knowledge of the technical products of modernity
with two-dimensional understandings of their inherited faith
tradition.
In the widest sense, all thought tends towards the mythical because
of the way in which the human mind works. The mind is not a
computer that dishes up individual words or factoids from a vast
electronic memory, performing in seconds calculations that would
have taken Einstein a lifetime or more. The mind works by drawing
inferences from the data presented to it by jumping, as it were, to
conclusions on the basis of very limited information. ‘A description
of our minds as a bundle of inference systems, differently activated
by different objects, is better than that of a mental encyclopedia
because it is much closer to the way a brain is actually organised’,
54

writes Pascal Boyer in Religion Explained, a book which brilliantly
combines an anthropological approach to religion with recent
discoveries in cognitive science and evolutionary biology.

Formally speaking, fundamentalists utterly reject the
subjectivization of religion or its internalization into the private
recesses of the self. A century before Jung, William Blake
anticipated the Swiss psychoanalyst by insisting that ‘all deities
reside in the human breast’. ‘Jesus was the Son of God’, proclaimed
Blake, ‘but so am I, and so are you’. Yet Blake’s mystical religiosity
was not far removed from that of those born-again Christians who
follow the moderate Southern Baptist theologian E. Y. Mullins in
describing the conversion experience as ‘falling in love with Jesus’.
American fundamentalists do not reject the subjective, mythical
‘Jesus of the heart’ in their rebellion against modernism. Indeed,
those millions of born-again Christians who claim to have taken
Jesus as their personal saviour may come closer to Blake’s heretical
Gnosticism than most of them would care to admit. But they also
demand the restoration of the historical Jesus along with an
inerrant Bible that is true ‘in all realms of reality’ and ‘all ﬁelds of
knowledge’, as the Statement on Scripture passed by the Southern
55

The snares of literalism

Myths, like poetry, exploit our inference systems. They encapsulate
thought rather than teasing or spelling it out logically. The
philosopher Karl Jaspers saw myth as the ‘ﬁrst order of knowing’.
Contrary to Auguste Comte, the philosopher of positivism, and
Rudolf Bultmann, the theologian who believed that Christianity
must be demythologized, Jaspers argued the case for myth as a
source of creative power, a ‘seedbed of metaphor, symbolism and
ideas out of which later reﬂection and analysis have developed’.
The great exemplars for using myth as a ‘seedbed of symbolism’
were Sigmund Freud and C. G. Jung. Freud found in the myth of
Oedipus a way of encapsulating the paradoxes and complexities of
human sexuality; Jung deployed myth as a means of exploring the
archaeology of consciousness through the surfacing of religious
symbols and archetypes in dreams.

Fundamentalism

Baptist Convention following the fundamentalist victory in 1987
has it. The imagination, which Blake described as the ‘Divine
Body in Every Man’, is fed and fructiﬁed by myth. But for
fundamentalists, who take myth in its popular sense of ‘lie’, as
distinct from an archetypical or elemental truth, myth must be
collapsed into history – the record of things as they actually
happened in the world of veriﬁable, external reality. And since the
Bible contains a number of prophetic books, a literal or factualistic
reading of it describes events that will occur in the foreseeable
historical future.
The collapsing of myth into history is one of the clearest of the
family resemblances by which different members of the
fundamentalist tribe may be identiﬁed. Though prominent among
premillennial Protestants, it is far from being conﬁned to them.
Sayyid Qutb, the Islamist ideologue who shaped the thinking of
Osama bin Laden and most of today’s Islamist groups, though a
man of great literary sensitivity, urged his followers to approach the
Koran as a manual for action, as distinct from a source of moral or
spiritual guidance. He should approach it in order to act upon it
immediately, ‘as a soldier on the battleﬁeld reads his daily bulletin
so that he knows what is to be done’.
A similar collapsing of foundational myth into contemporary action
informs Jewish extremism. In the Bible, the Children of Israel are
commanded by God to massacre the Amalekites, an indigenous
Caananite tribe, along with their women, children, and ﬂocks. For
fundamentalist militants such as Rabbi Yisrael Hess, formerly the
campus rabbi of Tel Aviv’s Bar-Ilan University, the Amalekites of
scripture are assimilated to contemporary Palestinian Arabs. An
article by the rabbi entitled ‘The Commandment of Genocide in the
Torah’ ends with the chilling words: ‘The day will yet come when we
will all be called to fulﬁl the commandment of the divinely ordained
war to destroy Amalek.’ Biblical eschatology collapses past and
future, putting history into reverse. For many American
fundamentalists, the return of Christ will be preceded by the war
56

against the Antichrist and the Days of Tribulation, when those who
have not been saved will perish miserably in a series of catastrophic
disasters. A popular version of the apocalyptic events predicted in
the Book of Revelation, Hal Lindsay’s Late Great Planet Earth, ﬁrst
published in 1970, has sold more than 30 million copies to date.

Messianic movements built around eschatological expectations are
a constant of human history and potent engines of change. The
future goal of a classless society to which the founders of modern
communism aspired was rooted in a secularized version of
Judaeo-Christian eschatology. There are close parallels in the Nazi
idea of a Thousand Year Reich in which racially pure Aryans will
rule most of the world. That history progresses teleologically
towards a ﬁnal eschatological denouement is fundamental to the
Judaeo-Christian outlook. As several historians, including
Christopher Hill and Norman Cohn, have shown, revolutionary
movements in pre-modern times, such as the Fifth Monarchy Men
57

The snares of literalism

A small, but critical, step separates such predictions from their
concretization or enactment. Most fundamentalists are content to
let the divine will take its course, unaided by human intervention.
But when the divine is actualized and brought onto the plane of
history, humans become its self-appointed instruments. In Israel
there have been several attempts by Jewish fundamentalists to
destroy the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, which were
built on the site of the Second Temple destroyed by the Romans in
66 ce. At his trial on terrorist charges one of the plotters, Yehuda
Etzion, challenged the competence of the Israeli court to sit in
judgement over him: God had given him personal responsibility to
advance the process of redemption through radical action. There is
a registered association, the Faithful of Temple Mount, which
demands that the Dome be levelled and the site puriﬁed by the
slaughter of a ﬂawless red heifer, as prescribed in the Bible, before
the new temple is built. As pure red heifers are extremely rare, the
association is funding a breeding programme in the United States
with the aim of producing such an animal.

Fundamentalism

of the English Revolution or the Anabaptists of Münster, were
fuelled by chiliastic expectations and end-of-the-world scenarios.
The communist and Nazi utopias drew deeply on these age-old
eschatological ideas.
The difference between an eschatology predicated on supernatural
intervention and one founded on human action may be slighter
than one might think, for fundamentalist action involves, almost by
deﬁnition, the appropriation of the divine will. As a Defender of
God, the fundamentalist militant claims the right to act on his
behalf. By collapsing myth into history, by taking action on God’s
behalf, the fundamentalist paradoxically afﬁrms the supremacy
of the human will. In Nietzsche’s famous parable, a madman runs
into the marketplace crying ‘I seek God! I seek God!’ – when the
bystanders ask him where he imagines God has gone, the madman
glares at them furiously: ‘Where has God gone? . . . I mean to tell
you. We have killed him, you and I! We are all his murderers!’ In
confusing God with their own will-to-power the fundamentalists
may indeed be killing Him.

Chapter 4
Controlling women

On 4 October 1987 in the village of Deorala near Jaipur in
Rajasthan, Roop Kanwar, a beautiful 18-year-old bride of less than
eight months mounted the funeral pyre of Maal Singh, her 24-yearold husband who had died of gastroenteritis (or possibly committed
suicide, after repeatedly failing his medical school entrance exams).
Taking her dead husband’s head in her lap, in the prescribed
manner, Roop was burned alive. In her ﬁnal moments one arm was
seen to stretch out from the ﬂames. Opponents of sati (who
included the state authorities and some religious leaders) saw this
as a gesture of deﬁance, or perhaps a desperate effort in her ﬁnal
seconds to escape. The crowd saw it as a benediction. There were
hundreds of witnesses to this particular act of sati, which, unlike
several previous episodes, attracted nationwide attention, partly
because of the publicity given it by feminist protestors and other
anti-sati groups.
Although the ritual burning of widows became illegal throughout
India after the British governor of Bengal, Lord Bentinck, banned
it in 1829, the practice has acquired iconic status as an act of
spiritual sacriﬁce and like similar practices, such as dowry
murders, female infanticide, and, latterly, the abortion of females
when the sex of a foetus has been determined by amniocentesis,
has proved difﬁcult to eradicate. Thirty-seven people, three of
them minors, were accused of abetting Roop Kanwar’s illegal

Fundamentalism or tradition? Murder or suicide? The ultimate
symbol of female oppression or an ironic, if extreme, demonstration
of ‘a woman’s right to choose’? The questions raised by the sati of
Roop Kanwar are not just signiﬁcant in themselves: they concern
our discussion of the F-word – its semantic biography. The Deorala
bride’s immolation seems to have been the occasion for its use in the
context of Hinduism and its introduction into the lexicon of Indian
English.
For its supporters, who included the weighty ﬁgure of
Shankayracharya of Puri, one of the four pontiffs or heads of the
Advaita religious tradition, sati is a profoundly spiritual act by
which a woman achieves immortality for herself and her husband.
By remaining at his side during the cremation, she shelters him
from the spiritual dangers of death, cancelling any karmic
shortcomings accrued during his lifetime, as well as offering
beneﬁts to those who witness her act. Like the Muslim suicide

immolation, including the bride’s father-in-law and her brother,
who lit the pyre. None of the indictments was successful because
no one who attended the ceremony was prepared to risk
prosecution under the Sati (Prevention of Gloriﬁcation) Act by
giving evidence in court. Within a year Roop Kanwar’s shrine was
attracting thousands of visitors. The money collected from
voluntary donations amounted to more than 70 lakh rupees (more
than $250 thousand), an immense sum in one of India’s poorest
districts. Despite laws enacted with the speciﬁc purpose of
banning pro-sati propaganda in local and national elections,
4,000 visitors attended the anniversary of Roop Kanwar’s sati in
1988. When the authorities stopped public transport from
Deorala, the pilgrims arrived on foot, by camel cart or private
buses crowded with people clinging to the roofs or hanging from
the windows. More than 800 wayside booths appeared, selling
souvenirs, snacks, toys, coconuts, and incense – along with the
inevitable photo collages of the smiling Roop and her husband
enveloped by ﬂames.

Fundamentalism

martyrs, the sati’s family derives spiritual beneﬁt from her act of
sacriﬁce: the blessings she accrues are enjoyed by seven generations
before and after her.
For its detractors, who include the Shankayracharya of
Kanchipuram, sati is far from being a necessary part of Hindu
tradition. According to this authority the philosopher, seer, and
teacher Adi Shankara, from whom all the Shankayracharyas derive
their spiritual authority, condemned the practice more than a
thousand years before the British intervention. Feminist activists
and writers see the practice as a ritualized instance of violence
against women, as part of the spiritual nexus which enslaves Hindu
women psychologically, encouraging abuse by denying their
individuality and conﬁning them to the household. For Sakuntala
Narasimhan, a journalist and musician, sati is merely the most
egregious in a raft of degrading practices to which Indian women
are constantly subjected.
Smothered or poisoned at birth, given away in marriage at a tender
age, bargained over like some commodity by dowry-hungry in-laws,
secluded in the name of chastity and religion, and ﬁnally burned for
the exaltation of the family’s honour, or shunned as inauspicious
widows, the burden of oppression took different forms at different
stages of a woman’s life, from birth to death, in a chain of attitudes
linked by contempt for the female.

Unlike the Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam, there is no single text, such as the Bible or the Koran,
identiﬁed with the Word of God or supreme religious authority in
Hinduism. The Hindu scriptures consist of a massive body of texts
dating back more than 4,000 years and added to over the centuries:
the example, par excellence, of what scholars call ‘cumulative
tradition’. Claims that there are references to sati in the Rig Veda,
one of the oldest of the Vedic texts, and the Mahabharata, the most
famous of the Hindu epics, have been challenged by scholars who
argue that the custom is of much more recent origin. Sati may be an
62

invented patriarchal tradition that originated among the nobility
(the Kshatriya class) rather than the priestly class of Brahmins, as a
means of ensuring that their women were not violated by invading
armies.

Despite the problematic use of the F-word outside the textually
based Abrahamic religious tradition, at least two family
resemblances suggest a relationship between the pro-sati
movement in India and fundamentalisms in other religious
traditions. The ﬁrst, to be looked at more closely in the next chapter,
is the politicization of religion and its relationship with nationalism,
both cultural and political. The second is the closely related issue of
gender. Politically, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which led India’s
governing coalition until 2004, was intimately involved in the prosati cause in Rajasthan, with one of its leaders, Vijayaraje Scindia,
insisting that a voluntary act of self-immolation by a widow in
dedication to her husband should not be allowed to constitute an
63

Controlling women

The Rajputs of Rajasthan, who take pride in their warrior
traditions, encouraged their women to immolate themselves in a
rite known as jauhar rather than submit to being raped by invaders.
As John Stratton Hawley suggests, there is a close connection
between sati and the memory of jauhar in Rajasthan.
Sociologically, the defence of sati appears to be related to the rise of
the Marwawi community, an important group of North Indian
merchants whose homeland lies in the area around the town of
Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan. The Great Queen Sati temple at
Jhunjhunu, not far from Deorala, is the nation’s largest and
wealthiest sati temple, drawing tens of thousands of visitors each
year. It commemorates the Rani Sati, a maternal manifestation of
the divinity. As the 15-year-old bride of an unconsummated
marriage, she was so dedicated to her husband that she chose sati
rather than life as a widow. The cult of the Rani Sati reinforces the
Marwawi clan’s group identity, acting as the primary focus of their
communal bond. The Jhunjhunu temple has inspired the
construction of several sati temples in Delhi.

Fundamentalism

offence in law. The head of the Janata Party in Rajasthan, Kalyan
Singh Kalvi, responded to the criticism that sati demeans women
by stating: ‘In our culture, we worship the motherland, dharma,
and nari, thereby making a direct connection between motherland,
religion, and woman.’
Rather than being the defence of an exotic item of religious heritage
threatened with extinction, the pro-sati agitation can be seen as
part of a counter-feminist or ‘patriarchal protest movement’ that is
common ground among fundamentalists in all traditions. In
a pioneering study that looked in detail at two versions of
religious fundamentalism – the original fundamentalism of early
20th-century America and the Shii Islamic version which came to
power in Iran in 1979 – the sociologist Martin Riesebrodt saw both
as aspects of a common patriarchal protest movement. Though
he refrained from drawing wider conclusions, there is plenty
of evidence to suggest that his approach can be applied to
fundamentalisms not just in Iran and America, but in many other
places currently being affected by politicized, public religiosity.
Several recent studies suggest that sex or, more speciﬁcally, the
control of female sexuality looms large in the language employed by
fundamentalists.

The wave of animalism which is sweeping over the world
today, and the degradation of the modern dance, the sensualism of the modern theatre, the gloriﬁcation of the ﬂesh in
modern styles, and the sex suggestion of modern literature,
the substitution of dogs for babies, the appalling divorce evil,
have all come about because of this degrading philosophy of
animalism which evolution is spreading over the earth.
(J. R. Straton, Searchlight, 7/12, February 1924)

64

In the 1920s, American fundamentalists like John R. Straton
explicitly linked the public expression of female sexuality to the
corrosive effects of Darwinism, or what he preferred to call,
polemically, ‘animalism’.
Revolutionary Islamist groups like the Fedayan-i Islam denounce
unveiled women in similar, if more dramatic, language: ‘Flames of
passion rise from the naked bodies of immoral women and burn
humanity to ashes’, causing young men to neglect their work. More
than half the provisions of a 1981 law introduced in the Islamic
Republic to codify Koranic prescriptions – 107 out of 195 articles –
were concerned with sexual activities, ranging from the prosecution
of adultery and homosexuality to preventing unrelated persons of
the same sex lying naked under a blanket.

According to Riesebrodt, what fundamentalists cannot prevent in
the way of structural transformation they attempt to impose
symbolically. A gender-based division of labour is found in nearly all
pre-modern societies. Under today’s conditions it can no longer be
65

Controlling women

Reisebrodt sees the obsessive concern with sexuality common to
American and Iranian fundamentalisms as a reaction to broader
anxieties resulting from rural displacement and economic change.
Fundamentalism, in his view, is a protest against the assault on
patriarchal principles in the family, economy, and politics. The
symptoms of patriarchal decline, he argues, manifest themselves
primarily in the spheres of the family and sexual morality; but the
underlying causes may lie in those very processes the sociologist
Max Weber regarded as integral to modernity: the expansion of
large-scale ‘rationalized’ operations, entailing formalized and
codiﬁed relationships, at the expense of small businesses based on
intimate paternalistic relations between employers and employees.
In resisting such aspects of what Weber famously called ‘the
disenchantment of the world’, fundamentalisms may appear to be
anti-modern. But reality forces them to absorb many of modernity’s
salient features.

sustained by traditional domestic arrangements, since in most
modern societies women are required in the workforce. Instead,
segregation is achieved by symbolic means such as sartorial coding
– long hair and skirts for American women, with ‘Christian’ haircuts
(short back and sides) for their menfolk; the veil in its various forms
for Muslim women and the beard, a mark of sex and piety, for
Muslim men. These forms of public religiosity may mask, but do not
necessarily reverse or even delay, the processes of secularization.

Fundamentalism

Family values are fundamental to religious thought and behaviour
in nearly all traditions. At times when social or political changes
affect the family, religions are liable to react as though they are
being undermined at their very foundations. However, given the
varied social worlds in which fundamentalists actually operate, the
results are far from being uniform. Nor are they necessarily
reactionary or conservative.
In Latin America, where men often abandon their children, the
patriarchal ideology promoted by evangelical churches encourages
them to be more responsible fathers. Women, the voiceless group
in the region, ﬁnd in evangelical and Pentecostal communities the
space and opportunity to exercise their gifts, while their husbands
are encouraged to encounter a relational and affective part of
themselves denied by the traditional ‘macho’ culture. Similarly,
Japanese New Religions, some of which were founded by female
prophets, theoretically reinforce ideals of male dominance while
actually allowing women more active and participatory roles than
traditional Buddhism and Shinto. In Sri Lanka, a women’s
Buddhist movement, the dasa-sil-mata, has campaigned to restore
a long-defunct order of Buddhist nuns, against resistance from
several male-dominated Buddhist organizations. Even in Iran,
where many female workers were purged after the 1979
revolution, the situation is not unambiguous, as the revolution has
encouraged the emergence of middle-class feminists determined
to reinterpret Islam as empowering them rather than restricting
their activities.
66

At the same time, real horror stories abound. A recent example has
been the fate of women in Afghanistan, a landlocked, mountainous
country where patriarchal tribal customs have retained their hold
for much longer than elsewhere. Among the Ghizlai, the women are
secluded from non-mahrams —men other than fathers or brothers
to whom they could be married. Among the Pushtuns, a bride who
does not bleed on her wedding night may be killed by her father or
brothers. ‘Honour killings’ for alleged sexual misconduct by women
are far from being limited to mountainous, tribal regions: they
occur in many other parts of the world, and though Jordan, Egypt,
Syria, and Iraq furnish numerous examples, honour killings are far
from being conﬁned to Muslim societies. The culture of ‘honour and
shame’, in which masculine honour and identity are predicated on
female virtue, was until recently just as prevalent in Catholic Spain
and Sicily, and the Orthodox Balkans, as it in Muslim lands.
Among the Afghani Pushtuns, however, the patriarchal structures
are as rigid and conﬁning to women as any on the planet. The
67

Controlling women

In the Islamic world particularly, the issue has been confused by the
symbolism of the veil and its ambiguities. In the 20th century,
women’s emancipation in Egypt, Iran, and other Muslim countries
was symbolized by the abandoning of the veil by upper-class women
under the inﬂuence of Western culture, or in some cases its
abolition by reforming autocrats. Abolished by decree by unpopular
governments, the veil could easily be transformed into an emblem
of cultural or political resistance. In Algeria, veiled Muslim women
played an active part in the struggle for independence against
France. In Egypt, observers have noted that the fundamentalist
ideology which insists on veiling for women may actually reﬂect an
emancipation from family bonds, rather than an endorsement of
them. Young women who wear the hijab (veil or religious dress) no
longer seek their parents’ permission to visit mosques or attend
religious meetings. Allah replaces the father as the ultimate
authority for individuals, while stressing their obligations to the
wider community.

Fundamentalism

Pushtunwali – the Pushtun customary law – differs in signal
respects from Islamic legal practice elsewhere. Divorce (a possibility
in mainstream Islam, though easier for men than women) is
prohibited and women are prevented from owning land (contrary
to the provisions of normative Islamic law). Women are wholly
regarded as the property of men and as pawns in economic and
political exchanges, with marriages, enforced or otherwise, used as
a way to end tribal feuds, to cement alliances between clans, or to
increase a family’s prestige. According to a well-known Pushtun
saying, ‘a woman is best either in the household or in the grave’,
with purdah (seclusion and veiling outside the household) regarded
as a key element in protecting the family’s pride and honour.
Because of male resistance, over 90% of Afghan women remained
illiterate until recently. (The current rate is still about 80% for
women, compared with about 50% for men.)
The political oscillations afﬂicting Afghanistan since the turn of the
20th century have revolved very largely around the ‘woman
question’ and the issue of female segregation. From the 1920s,
governments in Kabul had strongly supported women’s education.
King Amanullah (reigned 1919–29), like his contemporary Reza
Shah Pahlevi in Iran, urged women to come out of purdah. Heeding
his advice, members of the Westernized elite took to wearing
European clothes, with skirts to the knee and heads uncovered.
When Amanullah was overthrown by conservative tribesmen in
1929, women were put back in purdah and forced to wear the
chadari or burqa, the tent-like garment that covers the whole body,
leaving only a small grille for the eyes. Purdah remained in force
until 1959, when Prime Minister Daoud Khan announced the
voluntary end of seclusion and removal of the veil. In the 1960s,
mini-skirts began to appear in the capital and unveiled female
television announcers became stars for the minority of (mainly
urban) people with television sets. Nevertheless, unveiled, educated
women encountered brutal opposition, with women wearing
Western dress, including teachers and schoolgirls, having their
exposed legs shot at or splashed with acid. Generally, the pattern
68

was far from uniform, with considerable variation between cities,
such as ultra-conservative Kandahar and more liberal Herat and
Kabul.

All these measures encountered massive resistance from
conservative tribal leaders. In Kandahar, female literacy workers
were murdered. On at least two occasions, the men killed all the
women in their families to prevent them from ‘dishonouring’ them.
The new marriage rules enraged rural landowners, who regarded
women as a form of currency in property exchanges. Compulsory
education for girls raised the prospect that they might stop
submitting to family (that is, male) authority. The Soviet invasion in
1979, intended to prop up the faction-ridden socialist government,
sparked a vigorous and ultimately successful national resistance
movement, backed by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and (clandestinely)
by the United States. In what would become a global jihad (struggle
or holy war) against the Soviet occupation, women were notably
absent. Unlike most anti-colonial movements (including the
Algerian struggle against France), Afghan women played virtually
no part in the jihad. They were, however, conspicuous on the
69

Controlling women

In April 1978, the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)
seized power in a coup d état. The new socialist government, which
included a number of women at senior level, immediately enacted
changes in family law to improve the status of women while
encouraging female education and employment. Massive spending
on weddings, a major cause of poverty, was discouraged. A decree
on marriage limited the size of dowries and forbade the exchange
of women for cash or kind. Literacy classes, including compulsory
classes for women, were established in rural areas. Inspired by
socialist ideals and the considerable advances in education and
women’s emancipation that had taken place in the neighbouring
Soviet republics of Central Asia, the new rulers of Afghanistan
adopted a radical modernist outlook, one that linked Afghan
backwardness to feudalism, widespread female illiteracy, and the
exchange of girls.

Let us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big

(Maulvi Jalilullah Maulvizada, interviewed by Ahmed Rashid, June 1997)

When the ultra-conservative Taliban took over in 1996, after several
years of civil strife and tribal conﬂict that followed the Soviet
withdrawal in 1989, Afghanistan’s gender war reached its nadir.
Within three months of the capture of Kabul, the Taliban closed 63
schools in the Afghan capital, depriving more than 100,000 girls of
education, along with 150,000 boys. They shut down Kabul
University, sending home 10,000 students, of whom 4,000 were
women. Female employees were stripped of their jobs, creating
chaos in public health and social services. As many as 150,000
women may have been affected by the prohibitions on women’s
employment, including teachers, doctors, nurses, and civil servants.
Sophisticated, educated urban women were forced to wear the
burqa: decrees passed by the Taliban even banned the Iranian-style
headscarf, or chador, as an unacceptable foreign fashion import.
The Taliban regime, which ended in October 2001, following
America’s aerial bombardment, is the most extreme example of a

What prompts women to sign up to religious movements that many
would see as inimical to their interests? While generalizations are
problematic, it appears that nearly all fundamentalist groups or
churches studied by scholars reject legal steps to ensure equality
between the sexes and typically exclude women from the senior
ranks of religious leadership. All or almost all express concern about
control of female sexuality. All draw strict boundaries between male
and female realms. All are hostile to homosexuality, transvestism,
and other behaviours that transgress these boundaries or blur the
71

Controlling women

misogynistic, reactionary trend that is to be found throughout the
developing world, especially in South Asia and the Middle East.
But the trend is also strong in other countries where conservative
versions of Islam hold sway. Although female education is
encouraged by the state, Saudi women are still forbidden to drive
motor vehicles (obliging them, ironically, to rely on the services of
chauffeurs or taxi drivers to whom they are not related by blood
or marriage, contrary to traditional norms). In a notorious
episode that made international headlines in 2001, 15 girls at
a boarding school in Jedda were burned to death when their
dormitory caught ﬁre. The religious police closed the gates on
them because they had not covered themselves in accordance
with the requirements of strict female modesty prevailing in the
desert kingdom. As in some other Gulf states, Saudi women are
not allowed to travel abroad unless accompanied by male
relatives. Even in Sudan, where the National Islamic Front prides
itself on its activist female cadres, a woman must have her
brother or husband’s permission when applying for a passport. In
Pakistan, the Hudood ordinances passed by the military ruler
General Zia al-Haqq, under fundamentalist pressure, effectively
equated rape with adultery (zina), a crime which, though
punishable by death in Islamic law, requires four independent
adult male witnesses for its prosecution. The effect of this law
has been to make it virtually impossible for a woman to press
charges against a rapist without herself risking indictment for
adultery.

‘God-given’ distinction between male and female. All profess to
admire the chaste or virtuous woman while deriding the so-called
‘free’ or secular woman, whether the latter is seen as a
manifestation of the godless hedonism of popular culture, or the
product of alien Western lifestyles perceived as threatening to
national identity.
It may be argued, of course, that all the major religions are
fundamentally patriarchal, since they came into being at historical
periods distant from our own when human survival was predicated
on a strict division of male and female realms. As the hero Arjuna
tells the God Krishna in the Baghavad Gita:
In overwhelming chaos, Krishna,
Women of the family are corrupted,
Fundamentalism

And when women are corrupted,
Disorder is born in society.

In the languages of Islam, the word ﬁtna, ‘strife’, is applied both to
the early dissentions and civil wars that afﬂicted the primitive
Islamic community after the death of the Prophet Muhammad,
and the social strife that is seen to be the inevitable consequence
of female unchastity. Orthodox Judaism, like Islam, preserves
ancient taboos on menstruation, while women are seen as inferior
to the extent that they are exempted from the primary religious
duty of studying the Torah and Halakha. In the Genesis story,
common to Judaism and Christianity, it is Eve, the weaker moral
vessel, who is created from Adam’s rib and who, beguiled by the
serpent, tempts Adam to sin. St Augustine, the most inﬂuential of
the early church fathers, irons out the contradictions in Genesis
and Paul to make the case for female inferiority. Feminist
theologians in all the Abrahamic traditions have found ways of
re-reading the scriptures in order to demonstrate that the original
texts are less misogynistic than they appear, that androcentric
readings are false or narrowly partisan, and that alternative
feminist readings have equal validity. Such efforts, however, while
72

enabling women believers to participate more fully in religious
activities previously reserved for men, are not in themselves
sufﬁcient to explain the appeal that fundamentalist versions of
religion have for women.
In the ﬁrst place, one should not underestimate the attraction that
charismatic male preachers have for female followers. In the
Pentecostal tradition, preachers such as Jimmy Swaggart (before
his fall from grace after a much-publicized encounter with a
prostitute) project a powerful image of masculinity that is
consistent with the ‘macho’, militant style of Christianity
proclaimed by preachers such as Billy Sunday.

Jesus Christ intended his church to be militant as well as
carried the Big Stick . . . Strong men resist, weaklings compromise . . . Lord save us from off-handed, ﬂabby-cheeked,
brittle-boned, weak-kneed, thin-skinned, pliable, plastic,
spineless, effeminate, sissiﬁed, three-caret Christianity.
(Billy Sunday, Evening Times (Trenton, NJ), 6 January 1916)

A more measured and sober ﬁgure like Jerry Falwell may appeal to
female followers for his fatherly appearance. Television encourages
this, for while God the Father cannot be seen on camera, mature
and pleasant-looking men who speak on his behalf, such as Falwell
and Pat Robertson, may provide iconically satisfying substitutes.
Authoritative Muslim divines, such as Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi,
who has a regular slot on the al-Jazeera TV channel based in Qatar,
are immensely popular with female viewers; while Osama bin
Laden, viliﬁed by the West as the leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist
organization, has carefully made himself into an icon, modelled on
the Prophet Muhammad – an image that may exercise a powerful
appeal to Muslim women.

persuasive. It must ﬁght as well as pray . . . The prophets all

5. Militants displaying a poster of Osama bin Laden

But there are also more practical, down-to-earth reasons why
women may be drawn to fundamentalist movements. Part of the
appeal may be economic: in America, for example, although most
women can support themselves by their own labour, most of the
jobs available to women are less well paid than men’s, suggesting
that even in an advanced industrial society, women may live at a
higher level when solely supported by a male.
74

In a confused, and confusing, world in which gender roles are
changing or under constant review, the sexual bipolarity
encouraged by fundamentalists everywhere may be reassuring.
Fundamentalism addresses the competing claims of children and
career by seeming to authenticate motherhood, giving it priority
over the feminist goal of human self-development. Its values may
offer women a vision of ﬁnancial and social security, provided they
toe the line drawn by male religious leaders. The religious activities
fostered by fundamentalism may facilitate female networking,
providing fundamentalist women with the kind of gender solidarity
or sisterly support to be found, for example, in feminist group
activities. In Western countries, the encouragement by conservative
75

Controlling women

Fundamentalist emphasis on family values, with women seen
primarily in their capacity as mothers, wives, and homemakers, is
perceived as having an element of economic realism – that is,
legitimating and sanctifying an economic inevitability. In the
developing world economic realism may be reinforced by cultural
nationalism and anti-colonial sentiment. In Islamic countries, the
hijab in its various guises proclaims a symbolic rejection of Western
cultural and economic power (while affording a tacit acceptance of
its beneﬁts). Here the dislocating effects of industrialization and
rapid urbanization affect men and women equally. While the
general message of a return to ‘tradition’ as the key to the ills of
dislocation and disempowerment is as readily accepted by women
as by men in Islamic countries, the veil, as an invented or reinvented
tradition, accommodates changing economic realities by enabling
women to work without inviting the unwelcome attentions of men.
Where veiling is compulsory, as in post-revolutionary Iran,
fundamentalist readings of the legal texts may serve to commoditize
and fetishize women by focusing obsessively on their sexuality and
reproductive potential. Where it is espoused voluntarily, as among
many young Muslims living in Western countries, the message it
conveys may be the exact opposite. By concealing her body from the
stranger’s gaze, the wearer proclaims that she is not a sexual object
to be judged by her physical appearance.

Fundamentalism

politicians of ‘family values’, along with church-based charitable
activities, lightens the burden of welfare carried by the taxpaying
citizen, thereby restricting (in rhetoric, if not always in reality) the
reach of the state over civil society. In the Americas especially,
fundamentalism as well as some versions of non-fundamentalist
evangelicalism, such as Robert Schuller’s ‘theology of self-esteem’,
acts as a liberation theology of the right, lending a sense of
empowerment to people (particularly females) who had felt
themselves threatened or marginalized in a culture addicted to
hedonistic self-gratiﬁcation and sexual profanity.
It would be wrong to underestimate the appeal of fundamentalism
for women in societies where issues such as teenage pregnancy,
AIDS, and drug abuse are matters of public concern. In old Europe
such issues are primarily regarded as the concern of local or
national government. In laissez-faire America, where the state is
less committed to social spending and less inclined to intervene in
the operation of market forces, old-fashioned Puritan virtue,
rooted in America’s founding mythology, retains a powerful appeal.
Prosperity theology, implicit in the images of comfortable, middleclass Christians that appear on popular television shows such as
Pat Robertson’s 700 Club or Robert Schuller’s Hour of Power
becomes explicit when television preachers ﬁnance their ministries
by direct appeals for funds. The telethons to which viewers of
Christian programming are regularly exposed show heart-warming
stories of people who pledge their 15 dollars a month for Jesus,
despite desperate ﬁnancial circumstances. The promised rewards
are not in heaven, but in earthly bank accounts: for those who
make the pledge, previously sluggish investments suddenly yield
handsome dividends, the unemployed partner in Christ suddenly
lands a well-paid job. Reversing centuries of Christian teachings
on poverty, prosperity theology reveals the secular, this-worldly
heaven in store for born-again Christians. As the economically
more vulnerable section of society, women may be especially
susceptible to a message that promises tangible rewards for virtue
and abstinence.
76

Similar considerations, modiﬁed to suit different cultural
conditions, apply in the Islamic world, where the welfare
organizations run by Islamist or fundamentalist movements, such
as the Gamaat al-Islamiya in Egypt or Hamas in Palestine, are often
better equipped to address the plight of desperately needy people
than the corrupt bureaucrats of the government or regional
authority. Women who sign up to the movement may be rewarded
morally and materially: they receive the respect accorded to the
‘mothers of the believers’ while beneﬁting from the organization’s
welfare programmes. In Islam as in Protestantism and Judaism,
God may be seen to reward those who abide by His rules.

Similar trends are found in the world of Islam, where the traditional
tolerance of homosexuality as being less threatening to family
values than heterosexual (especially female) inﬁdelity is now being
replaced by active homophobia, with homosexuality wrongly
stereotyped as an imported Western vice. Fresh from their all-male
seminaries, the Taliban who ruled in Afghanistan executed
homosexuals by lapidation, bulldozing walls to crush their bodies.
In Iran, after the revolution, homosexuals were hanged; in Egypt,
77

Controlling women

There is, of course, a negative side to this picture. The beneﬁts of
sexual virtue are purchased at a formidable moral cost. In the
polarized, Manichaean world of fundamentalist discourse, virtue is
not enough. The enemies of God must be demonized. The ‘loose’
woman is an agent of Satan. In numerous fundamentalist tracts,
‘family values’ are a code-word for virulent homophobia.
Fundamentalist fears of homosexuality have now crossed the
Atlantic, infecting the Church of England, in which a signiﬁcant
proportion of clergy is gay. One diocesan bishop is even on record as
claiming that homosexuality is caused by demons in the anus. In
the summer of 2003 the appointment of Dr Jeffrey John, an openly
gay clergyman, as Bishop of Reading, and his subsequent
withdrawal under pressure from bishops in Africa and evangelicals
within the Church, became a major source of controversy,
threatening a permanent split in the Anglican Communion.

under fundamentalist pressure, discos frequented by gays have been
closed down and participants arrested.
In all such instances, fundamentalist concern to maintain the
family as a social unit and transmitter of conservative values has
been overtaken by a neurotic obsession with correct sexual
behaviour. Space does not allow for a lengthy speculation into the
causes of fundamentalist homophobia: but it seems obvious that
self-repression and fear of one’s own inner demons or sexual
impulses may have much to do with it. When homoerotic feelings
clash with the heterosexual values formally endorsed by religion,
homophobia (directed against those who acknowledge and give
expression to such forbidden sentiments) provides an all too
obvious and easy way out.

79

Controlling women

While homophobia may be a largely male obsession, the mantra of
‘family values’ holds an obvious appeal for women, who ﬁnd
themselves competing on unequal terms in an increasingly
competitive global environment. In the less privileged reaches of
Western societies, the priority they give to their religious life
enables such women to deal with the contradictions they experience
in a world in which self-esteem is supposed to be achieved through
work, but employers do not facilitate child-care or deal with the
female body as normative. While public rhetoric may insist that
family values are paramount, actual commitments to parenting are
not always valued. Their overarching religious commitment and the
female support fundamentalist women ﬁnd in their churches make
it easier for them to cope with lives that are full of tensions and
difﬁculties. The very emphasis on male authority in congregational
and domestic life has its advantages for such women. Marriage is
valued, sexual ﬁdelity demanded, drinking and carousing –
traditional male pursuits – are discouraged. Fundamentalist men
are expected to take an active part in bringing up their children.
As Frances Fitzgerald observed: ‘To tell Dad that he made all the
decisions might be a small price to pay to get the father of your
children to become a respectable middle-class citizen.’

Fundamentalism

Viewed from this perspective, female fundamentalism, which is
found in all traditions, may be a transitional phase between the
world in which women were largely conﬁned to the home and one
in which they fully participate in public and business life. Anita
Weiss, who has worked with Muslim women in a traditionalist
social milieu in Lahore, Pakistan, concludes that while the men
view their womenfolk as being more capable than in the past, they
also feel threatened by the potential of uncontrolled, educated, and
economically independent women to compromise their honour and
therefore their status among other men. Fundamentalisms are
dynamic movements in the contemporary social landscape. Though
conservative, they are far from being static. Nor are they invariably
reactionary. By formally accepting male authority when moving
into public arenas previously the preserve of males, fundamentalist
women hope to soothe men’s anxieties while quietly taking over
their jobs.

Fundamentalism and
nationalism I

The New Englanders are a People of God settled in those places
which were once the Devil’s territories . . . a People here
accomplishing the promise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus, that
He would have the Utmost parts of the Earth for His possession.
(Cotton Mather, New England Puritan)

The Puritan settlers in America would not have seen themselves as
‘fundamentalists’ since the term had not yet been invented.
Fundamentalism only comes into being when challenged by
modernist theologies, when post-Enlightenment scholarship is
perceived as threatening to the eternal verities enshrined in the
Word. But the American Puritans were fundamentalist in a broader
sense, in that they understood the portions of the Bible in a way that
differed signiﬁcantly from most of their Old World counterparts.
Whereas Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress would express the Puritan
spirit allegorically, his ‘City of Destruction’ and ‘Slough of Despond’
being convincing depictions of psychological states in the
wilderness of this world, the American pilgrim experienced his
biblical narratives concretely, especially the Book of Exodus, which
charts the deliverance of the Children of Israel out of Egypt. There
is a one-to-one correspondence between miraculous crossing of the
Red Sea by the Israelites led by Moses, and the Mayﬂower’s perilous
journey across the Atlantic. The New Jerusalem promised in the
Book of Revelation – a spiritual aspiration for William Blake – was
81

Fundamentalism

for Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, a Zion of bricks and mortar
where the Kingdom of God acquired material form.
‘The destiny of the American People is to subdue the continent, to
unite the world in one social family’, wrote William Gilpin,
Governor of Colorado Territory, in 1846. ‘Divine task! Immortal
mission! America leads the host of nations as they ascend to this
order of civilization . . . the industrial conquest of the world.’ It is
not customary to speak of ‘American nationalism’, but there can be
little doubt that the fundamentals of Christianity, as they came to be
understood by evangelical Protestants early in the 20th century,
were closely bound up with the construction of a core WASP (White
Anglo-Saxon Protestant) identity that sought to preserve itself from
dissolution by external inﬂuences, ranging from imported German
scholarship, Catholic immigration, and socialism, equated with
communism – not to mention the profane cultural inﬂuences
emanating from Hollywood, which was seen by conservatives as
being dominated by emancipated, non-religious Jews. On the
domestic front, moreover, most fundamentalists avoided having to
engage in social interaction with the descendants of African slaves.
The fundamentalist Southern Baptist Convention (comprising
some 40,000 independent churches) is overwhelmingly white;
while Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist educational bastion,
still applies archaic rules against mixed racial dating. While some
scholars see fundamentalism and nationalism as rival ideologies, in
America, as in Israel, the movements are often barely
distinguishable. Steve Brower comments:
‘Faith in the Nation’ though it still resonates through socially
conservative, militarily-connected networks inside and outside the
United States, has been appropriated in a symbolic sense by the
fundamentalists. It justiﬁes their role in realising global
evangelization and revitalizing Americanism.

American fundamentalists perceive no conﬂict between religion
and patriotism. Like their Puritan predecessors, they identify
82

Despite the very different social and political contexts of America
and the Islamic worlds, the arguments are very similar to those
deployed by Islamist writers and preachers. The Prophet
Muhammad, according to the Islamists, triumphed over his
enemies through battle as well as by preaching. Building on his
victories as well as his obedience to God, his successors, the Rightly
Guided Caliphs, conquered most of West Asia and North Africa as
well as Spain. In this view, the truth of Islam was vindicated on the
plane of real-time history, through its historical achievement in
creating what would become a great world civilization. Islamists
attribute the decline of Islam directly to loss of faith by Muslims,
and especially to Muslim rulers who do not rule in accordance with
Islamic law. If Muslims and leaders return to the straight path of
righteousness ordained by God, the social and political decline that
resulted in colonialism and the shabby, corrupt postcolonial order
will be reversed. Far from being counternationalist, as argued by
some scholars and ideologists, the fundamentalist argument that
God rewards righteousness in terms of national success and thisworldly prosperity is one that chimes in perfectly with nationalist
aims.
83

Fundamentalism and nationalism I

America with Israel as a land covenanted to God’s People on
condition that they followed God’s laws. The televangelist Pat
Robertson (who unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1987) is quite explicit about
this identiﬁcation. Since the Supreme Court ‘insulted God’ by
banning prayer in school, he rants, America has been defeated in
war, one president has been assassinated and another forced to
resign, foreign powers have amassed huge surpluses in their trade
with America, and the country is mired in debt. Since the Supreme
Court ‘legalized murder’ by extending abortion rights, the country
has been at the mercy of the OPEC oil cartel, American children
have been ‘victimized by marijuana, heroin, hallucinogens, crack
cocaine, glue, PCP, alcohol, unbridled sex, a pop music culture that
has destroyed their minds, the occult and Hindu holy men, and an
epidemic of disease’. Only a return to God can save the nation.

Fundamentalism

Theoretically, fundamentalism and nationalism are ideological
opponents. In the formal discourses of writers such as Abul Ala
Mawdudi, one the most inﬂuential Islamist writers, religion stands
at the polar opposite of nationalism and all that nationalism stands
for. Nationalism, for Mawdudi, promotes popular sovereignty or
the will of the people expressed through secular institutions such as
parliaments or national assemblies which legislate for the nation.
‘The principle of the Unity of God’, he wrote, ‘altogether negates the
concept of the legal and political sovereignty of human beings,
individually or collectively God alone is sovereign and His
commandments are the Law of Islam’. Mawdudi’s opposition to
nationalism was not just based on the fear that the Indian Muslim
community from which he came would be discriminated against or
suffer loss of identity in a Hindu-majority state. He was equally
opposed to Muslim nationalisms, which he saw as being as
reprehensible in the view of the Sharia law of God as Indian
nationalism.
In Arab countries especially, the Islamist movements are ideological
competitors of Arab nationalists. They aim to replace them in
government, whether by winning elections (as in Algeria in 1991) or
by armed rebellion, as happened in the Egyptian city of Assiut
following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in October
1981 and in the Syrian city of Hama, where at least 10,000 people
were killed after a rebellion by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982.
Islamist ideologues routinely denounce their nationalist
competitors or rulers as ‘inﬁdels’ or ‘man-worshippers’, as usurpers
who have substituted man-made laws instead of instituting the rule
of God. The theocracies they advocate are supposed to be
incompatible with human government.
In practice, the situation is rather more complicated. Historically,
nationalisms in Europe emerged with the rise of urban autonomy
and the ‘emancipation of the bourgeoisie’ from feudal bonds,
sometimes in alliance with monarchs against landed aristocracies,
sometimes against them. Both the French and American
84

revolutions generated nationalist forces by extending bourgeois
freedoms, with all the rights of citizenship, to the whole of society
(though not, in America’s case, to slaves). In France, as in Russia
after 1917, the revolution took a radically anti-clerical turn, because
of the Church’s strong identiﬁcation with the discredited ancien
régime. After 1792, the French Revolution, with its popular
assemblies, processions, and fêtes, began exporting its patriotic
ideals throughout Europe. Napoleon’s conquests catalysed the
forces of nationalism in Europe by provoking patriotic responses in
Britain, Spain, Germany, Poland, and Russia, if not in Italy, where
the anti-papal nationalism of the Risorgimento took much longer to
emerge.

It would be wrong, however, to see nationalism as being uniformly
anti-religious and secular. Everywhere nationalisms have been
permeated by religious symbols, especially in places where the core
identities that came to constitute nationhood had been buttressed
by religious differences. The different identities that make up
Britain were sustained by Presbyterianism in Scotland, nonconformity in Wales, and Catholicism in Ireland (excepting the
North), just as Polish and Croatian identities were sustained by
Catholicism; Greek and Serb identities by Eastern Orthodoxy;
Malayan (or Malaysian) by Islam; Tibetan, Thai, and Sri Lankan
identities by Buddhism. Yet for every case where national and
religious allegiances seem to run in tandem, there are also
contradictions. The Russian patriotism that gloried in the
achievements of Peter the Great at a time of incipient
industrialization and capitalism, also contained Slavophile
elements which harked back to pre-Petrine Muscovy and its
Orthodox monastic ways. The movement for Greek independence
from the Ottomans, inspired by the French Revolution and
Romantics such as Byron, combined two contradictory elements: a
bourgeois constituency of merchants and intelligentsia who sought
to revive the glories of ancient Athens; and a pious stratum among
the Orthodox clergy and peasants who yearned for the recovery of
Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.
The ideal Islamic order aspired to by modern Islamist ideologues,
including Abbassi Madani, the principal leader and founder of the
Islamic Salvation Front (Front Islamique de Salut (FIS) ) in Algeria,
the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the followers of the late
Sheikh Taqi al-Din al-Nabahani, founder of the Islamic Liberation
Party, Hizb al-Tahrir, corresponds to the classical concept of the
Caliphate. In the Arab case, defeat at the hands of Israel in
successive wars helped to popularize the quest for lost grandeur, a
compensatory mechanism, perhaps, for failure on the battleﬁeld.
The revival of the Islamist movement in Egypt, quiescent during the
heyday of Gamal Abdul Nasser, dates from Egypt’s catastrophic
defeat by Israel in 1967 – the moment when the modernist agenda
86

behind his brand of secular Arab nationalism with its socialist
orientation was discredited. But to state that the Arab nationalism
articulated by Nasser and the Islamism or fundamentalism of bin
Laden, Madani, and Nabahani are ideologically distinct does not
mean that they are mutually exclusive or incompatible. In the
Islamic world especially, nationalisms and fundamentalisms bleed
into each other and overlap.

Before European colonialism divided the whole world into discrete
territorial units whose frontiers were often determined by
arrangements among themselves, Islamic polities were organized
communally rather than territorially. States were not bounded by
lines drawn on maps. The power of a government did not operate
uniformly within a ﬁxed and generally recognized area, as
happened in Europe, but rather radiated from a number of urban
centres with a force which tended to grow weaker with distance and
with the existence of natural or human obstacles. Patriotism was
focused, not as in Renaissance Italy, England, or Holland, on the
city, city-state, or nation in the modern territorial sense, but on the
clan or tribe within the larger unit of the Umma, the worldwide
Islamic community. Local solidarities were reinforced by practices
such as marriage between cousins, a requirement in many
communities. Clan loyalties were further buttressed by religion,
with tribal leaders justifying their rebellions or wars of conquest by
appealing to the defence of true Islam against its inﬁdel enemies.
An example is that of the ‘fundamentalist’ Ibn Saud, a tribal leader
who conquered, and united, most of the Arabian peninsular
87

Fundamentalism and nationalism I

Islamic religious leaders were at the forefront of the nationalist or
patriotic movements that resisted European colonialism in the 19th
and 20th centuries, and in most cases threw it off after the Second
World War. Such movements were not nationalist in the European
sense, but they could be described as nationalistic, based as they
were on the impulse to liberate their societies from foreign
domination or governance.

Fundamentalism

between 1904 and 1926 in alliance with a movement for religious
reform founded by an 18th-century cleric, Muhammad ibn Abd
al-Wahhab. The Wahhabi movement, which is still highly
inﬂuential, thanks to the petro-dollars it receives from its Saudi
patrons, is counternationalist in the sense that it sees its mission as
universal and does not conﬁne itself within the territorial
boundaries of the Saudi state. Like other fundamentalist
movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood (with whom it forged
close ideological ties from the 1960s), it aims to revitalize the whole
of the Umma along Wahhabi fundamentalist lines. But in a broader
sense, it conforms to what Mark Juergensmeyer prefers to call
‘religious nationalism’ (rather than fundamentalism). Just as
secular nationalism is far from being devoid of religious content, so
religious nationalism is primarily political.
Juergensmeyer does not see nationalism as the ideological or polar
opposite of fundamentalism, but rather as its complement or
variant. He regards secular nationalism as itself having many of the
characteristics of a religion, including doctrine, myth, ethics, ritual
experience, and social organization. Both serve the ethical function
of providing an overarching framework of moral order, a framework
that commands ultimate loyalty from those who subscribe to it. The
strongest parallel, he concludes, lies in the ability of nationalism
and religion, alone among all forms of allegiance, to give moral
sanction to martyrdom and violence.
The interconnected, overlapping relationship between secular and
religious nationalisms is particularly evident where Islamist
movements have taken power or come close to exercising it. In
Algeria, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was forced underground
after the army intervened in December 1991 to prevent it from
winning the second round of the national elections. Prior to its
dismantling, the Front was a coalition of two main groupings: the
salaﬁ group, whose leaders were mostly educated through the
medium of Arabic in Algeria or outside the country in the Arab East
or English-speaking countries; and the Francophone al-Jazara
88

The merging of Islamist and ‘Algerianist’, or nationalist, currents in
Algeria is consistent with patterns in many other Arab countries
where the Islamist movements are challenging authoritarian or
military-based regimes. Theoretically, in its ‘pure’ or ideal-typical
forms, Islamism may present itself as an ideological alternative to
nationalism, which it sometimes describes as a manifestation of
kufr. But as in Ireland, where nationalists are almost invariably
Catholic and loyalists invariably Protestant, the realities are much
more complex. Opposition forces, whether nationalist or Islamist,
feed on common discontents and manifest a common desire for a
more authentic national culture. In their militant forms they exhibit
the same intolerance for lifestyles deemed to be immoral or
imported. Both attack the corruption of the military-backed
regimes they seek to supplant. Both attack nationalisms they regard

group, or Algerianists, who were considered more open to
modernist inﬂuences. Both factions were united in their desire to
establish a state based on a restoration of the Islamic law, although
al-Jazara offers a much less rigid reading of Islam than the salaﬁ
school, which is attached to the spirit and the letter of the Koran.
Both groups rejected democracy as kufr (disbelief ), and as a
concept that is semantically alien to the spirit and texts, both sacred
and secular, of Islam. (The objection is identical to that advanced by
Jewish fundamentalists, who regard democracy as being Greek and
hence alien.) The denunciations of democracy by FIS leaders was
one of the pretexts the army was able to use for the overthrow of
President Chadli Benjadid after the FIS victory at the polls in
November 1991. One of the main beneﬁciaries of the army’s action,
which unleashed a cruel and bloody civil war that is said to have
cost at least 100,000 lives, were Hamas (not to be confused with the
Palestinian movement of the same name) and Nahda, two moderate
Islamist parties that shared the cultural aims of FIS but were
prepared to work within the system. The divisions among the
Islamists enabled President Zeroual and his successor Abd al-Aziz
Bouteﬂika to reintroduce limited democracy with a measure of
Islamist support.

Fundamentalism

as discredited. But while challenging the old-style nationalism of
the incumbent elites, Islamists adopt many of their assumptions.
Islamists all agree that Muslim societies should be governed in
accordance with the divine (Sharia) law. However, they differ
among themselves as to the forms that the Sharia should take under
modern conditions. In striving to execute their agenda, they tend to
rely on an undeclared modernist premiss: whereas in pre-modern
or pre-colonial times the writ of government in Muslim countries
was relatively weak, with the Islamic law administered by the class
of religious scholars known as the ulama (the learned) under the
authority of the ruler who was himself, in theory, subject to its
provisions, the modern Islamists ‘hold the state responsible for the
deviation of the Muslim community when it is not Islamic, and
consider it the instrument of its salvation when it is’. As Laura
Guazzone points out, reference to the state as the central framework
of Islamist political thinking and action constitutes a signal
departure from theories of government developed during the
classical age of Islam. It is clearly the result of dialectics with the
cultural antagonists of Islamism, liberalism, nationalism, and
socialism and of the engagement of the Islamist movements in
national political processes.
The results are paradoxical. Where Islamists have actually held
power – as (brieﬂy, at municipal level) in Algeria, in Iran since the
1979 Islamic revolution, and in Sudan since 1989 – it is the
postcolonial state and the interest groups controlling it that have
beneﬁted, rather than civil society. The rhetorical appeal of political
Islam as representing ‘freedom, under God, from the dominion of
man over man’ – the source of its capacity to mobilize people
against tyrannical regimes – produces Machiavellian pragmatism
that can prove to be no less corrupt or authoritarian than the system
it replaces. The new regime’s stated priorities may change from
promising economic development and increasing prosperity to
defending private virtue and public morality. The shift in emphasis
from economics to morality may be to the advantage of free
90

enterprise while appealing to the values of recently urbanized rural
immigrants and the religiously observant middle class of small
businessmen and shopkeepers, the two groups which constitute the
backbone of Islamist support. In the case of Iran, and to a lesser
extent the Sudan, the Islamist conquest of the state may have
increased political participation, by enfranchising previously
excluded or marginal groups. But far from diminishing the
purchase of an oppressive authoritarian state over society, the
Islamists have achieved the opposite, intentionally or otherwise.
The shift from state control over the economy to state enforcement
of social morality involves no diminution in the state’s actual power,
but rather the reverse.

Far from being counternationalist in the sense of opposing the
91

Fundamentalism and nationalism I

The most explicit statement of this paradox appears in a letter the
Ayatollah Khomeini wrote in January 1988, shortly before his
death, to the man who succeeded him as the Supreme Guide of the
Islamic Republic, the then President Ali Khamenei. Khomeini ruled
that the power of the Islamic Republic was comparable to that
enjoyed by the Prophet Muhammad himself. It was thereby
permitted to take any measures in the interests of the Islamic state
even where these might conﬂict with Islamic law as traditionally
interpreted, including the religious obligations of prayer, fasting
during the holy month of Ramadan, or Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca).
By giving the state priority over Islamic law, Khomeini revealed his
true colours. Far from being a traditionalist, he established the
theological ground for a radical break in the traditional relationship
between Islam and the state, according to which the ruler was
supposed to govern in accordance with what God sent down (that is,
the Koran and the legal system derived from it) and to subject
himself to these laws. In post-Khomeini Iran, state power is as
formidable as it was before 1979 during the authoritarian regime of
the Shah. Students, writers, and politicians who have dared to
challenge the clerical rule have been harassed, tortured,
imprisoned, and in some cases sentenced to death.

Fundamentalism

secular national states imposed on the Islamic world since
decolonization, Islamism in practice mostly reveals itself as an
alternative variety of nationalism whose political focus is cultural
and religious rather than primarily economic (although Islamists
do have some economic theories such as interest-free banking,
which have been implemented in some Muslim countries, with
varied degrees of success). In the Palestinian territories occupied by
Israel since 1967, the Islamist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad
have shown more nationalist fervour than the more secularoriented Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) by engaging in
acts of terror, such as suicide bombings in metropolitan Israel,
speciﬁcally aimed at sabotaging the peace process, in which the
PLO has been engaged. In Pakistan, the Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami
was fervently nationalistic in supporting the army’s brutal
campaign (which involved the systematic mass rape of Bengali
women by soldiers mainly from the Punjab) against the secessionist
movement in East Pakistan that resulted in the formation of
Bangladesh.
There remains a contradiction between the utopian aim of a
restored universal Islamic caliphate shared by supporters of Osama
bin Laden and the reality of the national state. In practice, the logic
of circumstances and the interplay of local ethnicities and regional
rivalries ensure that the energies of Islamist movements are
directed towards the attainment of power within existing Muslim
states or communities.

92

Chapter 6
Fundamentalism and
nationalism II

‘The object of every national movement is only the seeking for its
god, who must be its own god, and the faith in him as the only true
one. God is the synthetic personality of the whole people taken from
its beginning to its end’, wrote Fyodor Dostoyevsky in The Possessed.
The same insight informs the religious sociology of Émile
Durkheim, who equated the sacred with the spirit of community, a
projection of the communal spirit onto a supernatural,
transcendental Being. Like religious communities, the nations are
collectivities that transcend the sum of their individual parts; like
religious communities, nations bear witness to the idea that human
blood must be shed in their defence: the war memorials, cenotaphs,
and tombs to the ‘Unknown Warrior’ that grace our cities attest to
transcendental demands the nation makes of its citizens. Such
demands, as Anthony Smith points out, are made on the basis of
faith rather than empirical evidence.
For nationalists, the nation, whatever the acts committed in its
name, is essentially and ultimately good, as the future will reveal;
the conviction of its virtue is not a matter of empirical evidence, but
of faith.

Nationalist rhetoric everywhere is suffused with religious
symbolism and purpose. The biblical story of Exodus exercised a
powerful inﬂuence on the construction of American identities, from
93

Fundamentalism

the Pilgrim Fathers to the New Zions (Nauvoo, Illinois, and Salt
Lake City, Utah) founded by the Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith
and his successor Brigham Young (the ‘American Moses’) in the
American West during the 1840s. Taken to heart by Bible-loving
Protestants, the Exodus myth has buttressed the group identities of
Scottish-Irish Protestants in Ulster and Afrikaners in Southern
Africa. In addition to the familiar enactment or exploitation of this
myth by European Protestants, Anthony Smith has shown how the
biblical idea of a ‘chosen people’ modelled on the Israelites was a
vital component in the outlook of peoples as diverse as Ethiopians
and Armenians.
For Jews, the Exodus narrative is not just treated historically but
ritualized and given a spiritual meaning. According to Rabbi Sybil
Sheridan, all Jews at the Seder table at Passover ‘are to think of the
Exodus as if they too were in Egypt at that time, and all are
understood to have stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and been
witness to the theophany that there took place’. It is not so much the
event in itself that is central to the belief, but its meaning and the
reinforcement of meaning through symbols and celebrations,
especially in orthodox Judaism, which tends to approach history
(or, to be more accurate, historical mythology) thematically rather
than ‘historically’. The themes of exile and return, sin and
repentance, are demonstrated again and again in the Bible, from
the Creation to the end of time. The theologian Rudolf Bultmann
credits the notion that history has meaning and purpose to the Jews
and Christians, whose understanding of history depended on
eschatology:
The Greeks did not raise the question of meaning in history and the
ancient philosophers had not developed a philosophy of history. A
philosophy of history grew up for the ﬁrst time in Christian
thinking, for Christians believed they knew of the end of the world
and of history.

Bultmann concludes that the idea of historical progress that
94

appears in the writings of the German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel
and those of Karl Marx, is really a secularized version of Christian
eschatology.
Hegel and Marx, each in his own way, believed they knew the goal of
history and interpreted the course of history in the light of this
presupposed goal.

Jewish ritual is centred on the myth of Exodus and the stories of the
Jews in their ancient homeland. Before the Nazi Holocaust,
however, the greeting ‘Next Year in Jerusalem!’ used by worshippers
on High Holidays was usually understood symbolically or
prophetically, as a hope to be deferred to the end of time. When
political Zionists began transforming the messianic promise of
redemption into a practical programme in the late 19th century,
their religious leaders were appalled. The yearning for Zion, they
argued, was a spiritual longing, to be assuaged only at the eschaton
or end of days, when the Messiah would come and restore the land
of Israel to its rightful owners. To turn this religious vision into a
political reality was both foolish and blasphemous. Some orthodox
rabbis went so far as to excommunicate the Zionists. However
perilous the situation facing Jewish communities in Europe,
especially those living under Russian rule, the Zionist solution was
unacceptable. If the Zionists had their way, Jewish life would be
95

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

Jewish nationalism, or Zionism, actualizes the eschatological
expectations surrounding the coming of the Messiah by desupernaturalizing the Redeemer, placing the destiny of Israel in
human hands. Most Jewish people regard themselves as
descendants of the ancient Hebrew occupants of Palestine.
Whether or not one regards such claims as sustainable in the face of
contradictory historical and genetic evidence, the idea of Jewish
ethnicity is underpinned by the religion, with Jewish identity
predicated on a religious tradition extending back to antiquity. The
Zionist movement secularized that tradition, without providing an
unchallengeable notion of secular Jewishness.

Fundamentalism

directed away from religious observance and the study of holy texts,
towards a political project outside the control of the rabbis.
Secular Zionism had a nationalist premiss: without a territory of
their own, the Jews could not become a proper ‘people’ – like
English, French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Irish, Poles, or Czechs.
The Zionist idea was predicated on the principle of national
self-determination as famously articulated by U.S. President
Wilson after the First World War. But Zionism also drew heavily
on the eschatological ideas embedded in Jewish religious tradition.
Redemption meant the physical return of Jews to the Land of Israel
– a sacred territory promised to their Hebrew ancestor Abraham by
God. Redemption conveys both secular and religious meanings.
Irredentism – the urge to restore unredeemed land to the nation –
was an important component of the nationalist movements,
including fascism and Nazism, that emerged in Europe after the
First World War. Non-religious Zionism shares with fascism the
idea that a particular piece of territory belongs inalienably to one
nation: in this respect, there is no essential difference in kind
between Zionist claims on Palestine and, say, the Italian irredentist
claims on the port of Fiume on the Dalmatian coast, a part of the
formerly Venetian territory awarded to Yugoslavia after the First
World War. Yet even the secular right-wing Zionists known as
revisionists perceived Israel’s expanding borders as stages on the
road to redemption. Ian Lustick calls them, somewhat
oxymoronically, the ‘non-religious wing of the fundamentalist
movement’. Led by Geula Cohen and Rafael Eitan, the revisionists
see the religious Zionists’ emphasis on the Land of Israel and its
settlement as opportunity to enlist the support of religious Jews for
maximalist nationalist aims. As Cohen explained: ‘All members of
Tehiya believe that we are living at the beginning of Redemption
even if no one knows its exact deﬁnition.’ By deliberately exploiting
the eschatological expectations of the religious right, these secular
right-wing Zionists acknowledge that religion is a more effective
ideological basis for their expansionist aims than the strand of
secular or romantic nationalism they themselves represent.
96

Similarly, the goal of aliya, the in-gathering of the Jews from all
over the world, exempliﬁed in Israel’s Law of Return (which
automatically confers citizenship on anyone who can prove his or
her Jewish descent), is both secular and religiously eschatological in
character. The boundaries between the secular nationalist ideology
of ‘redemption’ and a religious one are inextricably blurred.

Jewish immigration to Israel and settlement are beyond the law. The
settlers’ movement comes out of the Zionist constitution and no law
can stop it. For those to whom the Bible and the religious prescripts
are beyond the law there is no need to say anything further.

To the charge that they were acting in contravention to the will of
the people expressed through their elected government, another
Gush Emunim rabbi replied:
For us, what really matters is not democracy, but the Kingdom of
Israel. Democracy is a sacred idea for the Greeks, not so for the Jews.

Just as many Palestinians have come to admire the suicide bombers
who have inﬂicted misery on Jewish families, the Israeli settlers
have made heroes out of killers. Extremist rabbis commended

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

Gush Emunim, the principal settler movement, founded by
members of the National Religious Party in 1974, explicitly
describes its aim as being ‘the redemption of the Land of Israel in
our time’. This was to be achieved by allowing Jews to settle
anywhere in the occupied territories, and by political campaigning.
Gush Emunim members saw themselves as reviving ancient Israel.
They named their settlements after ancient biblical towns and their
children after Old Testament heroes. As their leader, Rabbi Moshe
Levinger, put it, the land conquered in 1967 had been returned to its
rightful owners as promised to their biblical ancestors by God. Gush
Eminum deliberately breached Israeli government rules banning
settlements near Arab towns. As one of their leaders, Rabbi Ben
Nun, declared:

Fundamentalism

Baruch Goldstein, the American-educated physician who
massacred at least 29 Muslim worshippers at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs in Hebron in February 1994 before being killed by the
crowd. For them, he is a ‘holy martyr’ who will act as the settlers’
intercessor in heaven. Goldstein’s status as martyr is the mirrorimage of the Palestinian suicide bomber whose act of terror is
described as an act of ‘self-martyrdom’ (istishad). In like fashion,
the status of hero-martyrs has been conferred on Khalid Islambouli,
executed for assassinating Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president
who signed the Camp David Peace Treaty with Israel, and Yigael
Amir, assassin of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who signed
the Oslo Accords with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Amir, who has
been described as a ‘serious, deeply religious and well-adjusted
student’, made no secret of his view that Rabin was din rodef – the
Halachic term for a traitor who endangers Jewish lives, and may
therefore be killed as a measure of communal self-defence. Before
he shot Rabin at point-blank range, he had ritually puriﬁed himself
and obtained a rabbinical ruling in justiﬁcation of his action.
Islambouli’s mentor, the engineer Abd al-Salaam al-Farraj, drew
heavily on the writings of the medieval theologian Ibn Taymiyya,
who condemned the Mongol rulers of Syria for failing to rule in
accordance with Islamic law.
The religious Zionists of Gush Emunim who refuse to give back
Arab territory, and the Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad who
refuse any accommodation with Israel, are in paradoxical collusion
against secular-minded Jews and Palestinians in their opposition to
any settlement involving a mutual accommodation between the
contested territorial claims of Israel and Palestine. The old-style
secular nationalists of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
have met (in principle) the secular demands of Israel by accepting
its right to exist as a Jewish state in accordance with United
Nations resolutions. The Israelis, for their part, have given formal
recognition to Palestinian rights by accepting the reality of the
Palestine National Authority, while colluding with the settlers in
limiting its power and undermining its authority. There exists a

precarious basis for an accommodation, but the religious
rejectionists on both sides are making this difﬁcult, if not
impossible, by raising the ante, elevating the historic quarrel
between Arabs and Israelis into a Manichaean struggle between the
absolute values of good and evil. The prospects for peace are
further diminished by the support Christian fundamentalists have
100

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

10. Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat

been lending to the US administration with its distinct pro-Israeli
bias.
When conﬂicts are hyped in this way, violence is the inevitable
101

Fundamentalism

concomitant. Religious nationalism further inﬂates nationalist
rhetoric by giving it a cosmic dimension. For Hamas and other
Islamist organizations, the struggle with Israel is transnational and
cosmic. A communiqué issued after US troops were sent to Saudi
Arabia in 1990 described it as another episode in the ‘ﬁght between
good and evil and a hateful Christian plot against our religion, our
civilization and our land’. In January 2003 President George W.
Bush himself echoed the rhetoric of the Islamists like bin Laden
who see conﬂicts between Muslim and Western governments in
terms of an age-long struggle between good Muslims and evil Jews
and Crusaders, when he packaged Arab nationalist Iraq, Islamist
Iran, and communist North Korea – three countries with utterly
different ideologies and with few, if any, connections between them
– into a monolithic ‘axis of evil’ to be resisted by America.
The effect of such rhetoric is twofold. In societies such as America,
Ireland, or parts of the Muslim world where religion has been an
important part of the culture as well as an agent of socialization, the
use of religious language has great mobilizing potential. People will
respond positively to political messages couched in language
associated with religion, because religion is thought of as good. But
the use of such language also tends to transcendentalize disputes,
elevating them, as it were, from the mundane to the cosmic level.
The result is that conﬂicts are absolutized, rendering them more
intractable, less susceptible to negotiation. Where people
acknowledge the realities of competing interests (as, for example, in
the national bargaining sessions over agricultural quotas in the
European Union), compromise is not only possible: it is the only
game in town. Where religious language is invoked, as in Ireland or
Israel-Palestine, the play of interests is transcendentalized,
subsumed, as it were, into a much grander, Manichaean contest,
between polarized opposites of absolute good versus evil. Since
every nationalist group is likely to clash with the competing
nationalisms of its neighbours, religious language intensiﬁes
conﬂict, because most nationalisms arise where identities are
contested or where land is subject to competing claims. The use of
102

religious language as a strategy for mobilizing support is most likely
to succeed in situations where national or ethnic identities are
grounded in religion or sustained by religious differences. In
absolutizing the conﬂict, the play of competing interests – the stuff
of normal politics – is forgotten or overruled.

On the face of it, the three Abrahamic monotheisms might seem
more susceptible to political exploitation of the kind we have been
describing than Hindu polytheism or Buddhism, because of the
absence in these traditions of an orthodoxy based on a single
scriptural tradition. Hinduism is not so much a single religion as a
loose collection of traditions (that of the Shaivites, the Vaishnavas,
the Shaktas, the Smartas, and others) that share some common
themes while tolerating a remarkable variety of religious
expressions. Unlike the Abrahamic traditions, each of which has a
canonical scripture that can function as a rallying point for defence,
the Hindu tradition contains such an abundance of scriptures, laws,
103

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

The Israeli example is instructive. As members of a First World,
industrial society accustomed to Western lifestyles, with swimming
pools, ﬂush-toilets, and other modern conveniences, the Israeli
settlers are greedy for water, a scarce resource in Palestine.
According to recent estimates, Israeli settlers are now using 80% of
the water available to farmers in Palestine. When religious language
is used, the illegal and disproportionate use of water is translated
into a God-given grant of land and water-rights to Abraham. In the
biblical rhetoric of the settlers, the Jews are God’s special people;
the Arab Palestinians are identiﬁed with the Amalekites, a
Canaanite tribe whom the ancient Hebrews were commanded to
annihilate totally, with their women, children, and ﬂocks. Where
good and evil, God and the Devil, are ranged in opposite camps,
who would deliberately choose the latter? Far from being its
ideological competitor, the religious fundamentalism in IsraelPalestine, Chechnya, Kashmir, and many other of the world’s most
troubled regions is best understood as an intensiﬁcation or
deepening of nationalism by way of religion’s catalysing force.

Fundamentalism

and philosophies that it becomes very difﬁcult to single out any one
speciﬁc item as being basic or ‘fundamental’.
Nevertheless, there are some compelling parallels, or ‘family
resemblances’, with the fundamentalisms one ﬁnds in the Abrahamic
traditions. Like its Islamic counterpart, Hindu revivalism, with its
nationalist or fundamentalist offshoots, is rooted in a reformist
religious tradition more than a century old. The original movement
was not in the ﬁrst instance anti-Muslim but anti-colonial,
stimulated by the British administration’s pigeonholing of India’s
religious communities into identiﬁable and hence manageable
groups. From the 1871 census the British deﬁned their Indian
subjects according to religion. With the introduction of democratic
institutions at local level, starting in 1909, religious groupings were
organized into separate electorates, with a number of constituencies
reserved for Muslims in each province, and similar arrangements for
Christians in Madras and Sikhs in the Punjab. For the educated
Hindu elite, the need to cultivate their own constituencies meant
delineating a broad-based communal identity beyond the old caste
system. The creation of a new Hindu identity inevitably generated
reciprocal responses amongst Muslims and Sikhs (as well as from the
smaller Jain and Parsee communities whose separate identities were
acknowledged), with all of the three main groups competing against
each other for a privileged position in colonial society.
The reformist movements within Hinduism (a term invented by
Europeans) bear some family resemblances to the Islamic salaﬁ
movement that originated in colonial Egypt towards the end of the
19th century. Swami Dayananda Sarasvati (1824–83), founder of
Arya Samaj (the Society of Aryas), is one of the spiritual and
intellectual progenitors of the RSS (Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh,
or ‘national union of volunteers’) and its offshoot the BJP
(Bharatiya Janata Party) – the senior partner in the coalition that
governed India from 1998 to 2004). In some respects, he resembles
Afghani in his rejection of tradition and the search he undertook for
a modernized, more rational religion that would regenerate his
104

society. A Brahman from a well-to-do Shaivite family in Gujarat, he
was profoundly affected, aged 14, by watching a mouse consume
(and pollute) offerings of food made to the statue of Shiva during an
all-night vigil when other members of his family had dozed off.
After wandering around India for 13 years as a holy man (a
conventional apprenticeship for an aspiring guru), Dayananda
found a teacher who persuaded him to preach his reformist
doctrines in Hindi (the popular vernacular) rather than in learned
Sanskrit.

Dayananda’s ideas ﬁrst took root among Hindus in the Punjab,
which has large Muslim and Sikh populations, and it was Punjabi
leaders of the Arya Samaj who founded the Punjab Hindu
105

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

Some of Dayananda’s ideas reveal an afﬁnity with the
fundamentalisms to be found in the Abrahamic traditions. He
believed that the Indian scriptures, the Vedas, were the highest
revelations ever vouchsafed to humanity, and contained all
knowledge, scientiﬁc as well as spiritual. All the knowledge that is
extant in the world, he would claim, originated in Aryavarta, the
Land of Arya, his name for ancient India, a mythical realm whose
kings ruled over all the earth and taught wisdom to all their peoples.
Through their vast knowledge, the ancient Indians were able to
produce the weapons of war described in the great epics such as the
Mahabharata. Since the knowledge of the Vedas is of general
applicability, all references to kings and battles are in fact political
or military directives. The sentiment is identical to that of the
Islamists who recall the age of the Rightly Guided Caliphs as an era
of justice and prosperity (although, in actual fact, three of the ﬁrst
four caliphs were brutally murdered). His point about military
directives is strikingly similar to an argument employed by the
Islamist writer Sayyid Qutb in Milestones, the tract he wrote while
in prison in Egypt before his execution in 1966. Muhammad’s
Companions, according to Qutb, used the Koran not just for
aesthetic or even moral guidance, but as a manual for action, as a
soldier on the battleﬁeld reads his daily bulletin.

Fundamentalism

Provincial Sabha (council), the ﬁrst politically oriented Hindu
group, in 1909. By 1921, it had become the All-India Hindu
Mahasabha (great council), one of the best-known institutions of
Hindu reaction. The council actively fostered the growth of the RSS.
Now a highly professional organization with 25,000 branches
throughout the country, the RSS has lent its organizational skills to
two political parties, the Jana Sangh and its de facto successor, the
BJP. Both L. K. Advani, president of the BJP, and the former Indian
Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee started their careers as RSS
organizers.
The parallels with the Muslim Brotherhood founded in
British-dominated Egypt in 1928, just three years after the RSS,
are compelling. Both movements adopted something of the style of
their colonial masters: the Muslim Brotherhood had afﬁnities with
the Boy Scout Movement and Young Men’s Christian Association
(YMCA) organizations that stressed the importance of physical
activity, with paramilitary overtones. The khaki shorts worn by RSS
volunteers during their drills were modelled on the uniform of the
British Indian police. Both organizations discouraged democratic
dissent under an authoritarian style of leadership. Both
organizations encouraged male bonding by excluding women
(though both allowed the creation of smaller all-female
organizations). Both opposed the mixing of sexes within the
organization as contrary to religious norms.
Like the Muslim Brothers, members of the RSS are organized into
groups that transcend or substitute for family ties. Hasan al-Banna,
founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, grouped his followers into
families and battalions; young Palestinians who today volunteer for
suicide missions are organized into friendship packs who may act as
family substitutes, while holding them to their decision. The
organizers of the RSS model themselves on Hindu renunciates.
‘Dedicated to a higher goal [they] are supposed to abandon family
ties and material wealth.’ Like the Palestinian and Lebanese
volunteers belonging to the Shia Hezbollah, they are generally
106

young, unmarried men in their 20s. They wear Indian-style dress
and are expected to lead an exemplary, ascetic existence, although
some may marry and have families after a period of service.
Organizers serve without salary, but their material needs are taken
care of. Some volunteers are provided with motor scooters for
getting around town. Both the Brotherhood and the RSS
consciously blend elements of modernity with aspects of
tradition, combining indigenous ideas of spiritual leadership
with organizational techniques borrowed from Western
bureaucracy.

idea of Hindu Nation stands in contrast to the idea of a composite,
territorially deﬁned political entity that developed among the
secular nationalists and would be enshrined in the Indian
constitution. The modern western idea of nation, according to
Savarkar, does not do justice to the ancient glory of the Hindu
people, the indigenous and numerically dominant population of the
subcontinent. The subcontinent is their motherland, and Hinduness
is the quality of their national culture.

Hindutva is not the same as Hindu religious orthodoxy because,
according to Savarkar, its spirit is manifest in other South Asian
religions, including Jainism, Sikhism, and Indian Buddhism.
Muslims and Christians, by contrast, are seen as foreign elements in
the subcontinent, which rightly belongs to Hindus.
The RSS leader M.S. Golwalkar, like his Indian contemporary, the
Islamist ideologue Mawdudi, expressed his admiration for the Nazis
107

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

The Hindu movement’s leading intellectual was V. D. Savarkar
(1883–1966), who held the presidency of the Hindu Mahasabha
from 1937 to 1942. Like Sayyid Qutb, he wrote his most inﬂuential
work, Hindutva (‘Hindu-ness’), in prison, where he spent many
years after his detention by the British in 1910. Hindutva is a
manifesto for religious nationalism. As Daniel Gold explains,
Savarkar’s

in Germany, who held similar ideas about national purity.
‘Germany has shocked the world by purging the country of the
semitic races the Jews’, he wrote in 1939 – ‘a good lesson for us
in Hindusthan to learn and proﬁt by’. As suggested above, there
is a fundamentalistic element in Dayananda’s elevation of the
Vedas to the sum of human knowledge, along with his myth of
the golden age of Aryavartic kings. But the predominant tone,
and its consequences, are nationalist. Hindutva secularizes
Hinduism by sacralizing the nation, bringing the cosmic whole
within the realm of human organization. As Daniel Gold astutely
observes:
If personal religion entails among other things the identiﬁcation of
the individual with some larger whole, then the Hindu Nation may
appear as a whole more immediately visible and attainable than the
Fundamentalism

ritual cosmos of traditional Hinduism.

The problem, of course, is that such a sacralization of nationality is
explicitly anti-pluralistic. Both Arya Samaj and the RSS deﬁne their
religion in contradistinction to other groups. The Hinduization of
Indian nationalism generated a reciprocal response among
Muslims that led to the traumatic partition of the subcontinent in
1947, with many thousands killed or maimed in communal rioting.
The shock of the sainted Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by an
RSS member in January 1948 allowed Nehru to ban the RSS and its
afﬁliates, enabling Congress to foist upon India a secular
constitution that lies squarely in the best Western tradition. As
Sunil Khilnani, one of India’s foremost historians, has pointed out:
Constitutional democracy based on universal suffrage did not
emerge from popular pressures for it within Indian society, it was
not wrested by the people from the state; it was given to them by the
political choice of an intellectual elite.

The sacralization of Indian identity would remain a potent,
corrosive force in the body politic, a sleeping giant that could all too
108

easily be woken by politicians willing to play the communal card.
Job reservations or afﬁrmative action programmes aimed at
protecting scheduled castes (the former Untouchables), could be
presented as clashing with the rights or aspirations of the majority.
In the words of a former state director-general of police and ofﬁcial
of the VHP afﬁliated to the RSS: ‘We feel that what we are doing is
good for the country. After all what is good for 82% of the country is
good for the rest of the country, isn’t it?’ The ‘Fundamental Rights’
guaranteeing ‘freedom of conscience and free profession, practice
and propagation or religion’ under article 25 of the constitution
would remain highly problematic in a society as religious as India’s.
As T. N. Madan points out:

an idea is alien to the indigenous religious traditions, which are
holistic in character and do not recognize such dualistic categories
as sacred versus profane, religious versus secular, or public versus
private.

One of the severest tests facing India’s secular constitutional
arrangements has come from the fundamentalist, or rather
religious nationalist, movement within the minority Sikh
community. The militant Sikh movement led by the
charismatic preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (1947–84)
ﬁts the pattern of movements in other religious traditions that
have turned to, or ended in, violence. A relatively young religion
founded in the Punjab during the 16th century, Sikhism constantly
faced the possibility of being reabsorbed into the Hindu
mainstream from which it originally sprang. Like other
fundamentalist leaders, Bhindranwale strongly resisted the
pressures towards assimilation, whether Hinduistic or secular
Western. In his preaching he called for a return to the original
teachings of the ten gurus and strict adherence to their codes of
moral conduct, paying more attention to politics and social
behaviour than to the cosmological questions the religion
addresses.
109

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

secularism does not mean in India that religion is privatized: such

In defending his community against the perceived cultural
encroachments of Hindu Punjabis, Bhindranwale unleashed a
campaign of terror that cost hundreds of innocent Hindu lives. To
the symbolic or latent militancy of Sikhism represented by beard,
dagger, and sword he added two new items: the revolver and the
motorcycle. Towards the end of 1983, fearing arrest, Bhindranwale
and dozens of armed supporters installed themselves in the
compound surrounding the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest
shrine of Sikhism, an area constantly thronged with visitors,
pilgrims, priests, and auxiliary helpers. By taking refuge in the
temple area, he challenged the government to deﬁle the sanctuary
using the pilgrims and others as human shields, while permitting
his followers to desecrate it.

There are parallels here with the seizure of the sanctuary in Mecca,
Islam’s holiest shrine, by the Saudi rebel Juhaiman al-Utaibi in

the Golden Temple in June 1984, resulted in more than a thousand
deaths (including Bhindranwale’s), many of them innocent
pilgrims. Shortly afterwards, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who
authorized the attack, was murdered by her trusted Sikh
bodyguards. Nearly 3,000 Sikhs lost their lives in the ensuing
rioting in Delhi and other cities. In a retaliatory attack, Sikh
terrorists may have been responsible for the crash of an Air India
jumbo jet off the Irish coast in June 1985, killing all 329 people on
board.

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

The second major challenge to India’s secular constitution took
place seven years later, in 1992, when a gang of Hindu militants
destroyed the Babri Masjid (mosque of Babur) in the town of
Ayodhya, southeast of Delhi. Ayodhya is the mythical birthplace of
Lord Rama, hero of the Rayama, one of the great Indian epics, and
an incarnation of the great god Vishnu. The Kingdom of Ayodhya,
over which Rama rules with his beautiful consort Sita after his exile
and travails in the forest, epitomizes the golden age of Aryavarta as
described by Dayananda. Rama’s alleged birthplace, however,
became the site of a mosque said to have been constructed on the
orders of Babur, the ﬁrst Moghul emperor, after a visit to the city in
1528. In 1949, two years after Independence, local worshippers
reported the miraculous appearance of Rama’s image in the
building. (Muslims, more sceptically, believed it had been put there
by local Hindu activists.) An outbreak of communal rioting
persuaded the local magistrate to close the building, but he allowed
Hindu worshippers to visit it once a year on the anniversary of the
image’s appearance. The build-up to the crisis started in earnest in
1986 when a local court allowed the building to be opened for
Hindu worship. In the ensuing riots, bombs were set off, shops were
burned, and at least 20 people died. By 1989, the confrontation had
became a major national issue, with an all-India campaign by
Hindu activists to construct a new temple at the site. Small
donations were sought from millions of ordinary people; villagers
from all over India collaborated in making bricks for the temple’s

construction. Tensions escalated throughout the summer, with
increasing communal rioting taking place as the elections
approached. The government’s efforts at mediation were
unsuccessful, and in November the Congress faction led by Indira’s
son Rajiv Gandhi was defeated at the polls. His successor proved no
more successful at defusing the tension. In December 1992, in
deﬁance of the courts and their own religious leaders, Hindu
militants demolished the mosque during a ceremony for the
dedication of the new temple, many of them using their bare hands.

In an action that infuriated India’s Muslims (and would have wide
repercussions in Pakistan), the 13,000 police and militiamen who
had been drafted to protect the site failed to intervene. The
subsequent riots in Bombay and other cities were the worst since
India’s independence in 1947. In a series of pogroms, thousands of

Fundamentalism

innocent Muslims lost their lives: even in Bombay’s afﬂuent Colobar
district, where real estate prices rival those of Tokyo and New York,
middle-class Muslims found it necessary to remove their names
from lists of residents on apartment blocks, fearing lynching by the
mob.
Sri Lanka provides a further example of South Asian religious
nationalism. Here, in a situation that bears a certain resemblance to
Ireland, the demand for recognition of its separate status by an
island minority linked by religion and ethnicity to its larger
neighbour (in this case Hindu Tamils of southern India) is
perceived by members of the majority community Sinhalese
Buddhists as a threat to the nation’s integrity. Like Irish
Catholicism, the Theravada Buddhism of Sri Lanka has developed
into a nationalist ideology in which religion has become a marker of
communal identity. The reasons are largely historical. Sri Lankan
Buddhists regard themselves as the survivors of the great Buddhist
empire founded in India by King Asoka in the 3rd century bce.
While in mainland India Buddhism eventually disappeared as
society relapsed into the multiform patterns of worship which came
to be known as Hinduism, the Sinhalese held to the Buddhist faith,
which eventually became politicized. In Sri Lanka (according to
Donal Swearer), Buddhism provided the stirrings of anti-colonial
sentiment by offering ‘the only universally acceptable symbol to
represent an accumulation of grievances – economic, social, and
psychological – which were as yet, for the most part, inarticulate
and incapable of direct political exploitation.’
A reformist movement among the laity, stimulated in part by the
American theosophist Colonel Olcott, won some concessions from
the British, but in general the colonial authorities were hostile
towards the Buddhist sangha (religious institution), which they
saw as a threat to their power. The most articulate spokesman of
the new reformed or nationalist Buddhism came to be known as
the Anagarika Dharmapala (the ‘Homeless Guardian’ of the
Dharma or universal law). An Afghani-like ﬁgure who occupied a
114

position somewhere between a monk and a lay politician, he
formulated, according to Donald Swearer, a simpliﬁed, moralistic
Buddhist ideology that was doubtless stimulated by the challenge
posed by Protestant missionaries. Like Hasan al-Banna,
Dharmapala fulminated against the social vices deemed to have
been introduced under colonial auspices, while harking back to an
early, heroic age when righteousness prevailed – in this case, the
reign of King Dutthagamani (161–137 bce), who wrested control
from a Tamil ruler and thus became an exemplary nationalist
hero:
My message to the young men of Sri Lanka is Believe not the alien
who is giving you arrack, whisky, toddy, sausages, who makes you
Dutthagamani in spirit and try to identify yourself with the thoughts
of the great king who rescued Buddhism and our nationalism from
oblivion.

In 1956, the year of Britain’s Suez debacle, S. W. R. D.
Bandaranaike, leader of the opposition Sri Lankan Freedom Party
(SLFP), was able to win power on a pro-Buddhist, pro-Sinhalese
ticket, replacing the upper-class, English-educated liberals of the
United National Party who had governed the country since
independence. The SLFP beneﬁted hugely from celebration of the
2,500th anniversary of the Buddha’s birth (Buddha Jayanti) the
following year and from the previous publication of a report
detailing the suppression of Buddhism under the British. The
Jayanti enlarged upon and celebrated the national myth bonding
the Buddhist faith to the land and the Sinhalese nation which had
‘come into being with the blessing of the Buddha as a ‘‘chosen race’’
with a divine mission to fulﬁl, and now stands on the threshold of a
new era leading to its ‘‘great destiny’’ ’. The SLFP was aggressively
supported by the United Monks’ Front, which rejected the concept
of secular nationhood in terms very similar to those that would be
used by the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini in his famous Najaf
lectures.

The ‘Buddhisization’ of Sri Lankan politics had the inevitable
consequence of making non-Buddhists (Tamils and Muslims) feel
excluded from the nation, provoking demands by Tamil separatists
for a state of their own.

In ancient days, according to the records of history, the welfare of the nation and the welfare of the religion were
regarded as synonymous terms by the laity as well as by the
Sangha. The divorce of religion from the nation was an idea
introduced into the minds of the Sinhalese by invaders from
the West who belonged to an alien faith. It was a convenient
instrument of astute policy to enable them to keep the people
in subjugation in order to rule the people as they pleased. It
Fundamentalism

was in their own interests and not for the welfare of the
people that these foreign invaders attempted to create a gulf
between the bhikkus (monks) and the laity – a policy which
they implemented with diplomatic cunning. We should not
follow their example and should not attempt to withdraw the
bhikkus from society. Such conduct would assuredly be a
deplorable act of injustice, committed against our nation,
our country, our religion.
(Statement by the United Monks’ Front, 1946, in Donald K. Swearer,
‘Fundamentalist Movements in Theravada Buddhism’, in Marty and
Appleby, Fundamentalism Observed)

The Tamil Tigers, as the activists called themselves, were concerned
not only with securing political rights, but more importantly with
maintaining a cultural, ethnic, and religious identity which had
been suppressed or alienated as Sinhalese nationalism became
increasingly reliant on Buddhist symbols. More than 60,000 people
from both communities lost their lives in the ensuing civil war that
lasted nearly two decades. In the late 1980s, the Tigers resorted
116

increasingly to the novel tactic – pioneered by the Shii Hezbollah in
Lebanon – of suicide bombing. More often than not the victims
were civilians. A steady campaign of assassinations (including that
of the Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991, by a female
bomber) and indiscriminate murder was kept up through the 1990s
and lasted well into the 2000s.

The heart of the fundamentalist project, in line with this analysis,
lies not in religion itself but in the essentially modern agenda of
extending or consolidating the power of the national state or, to use
the term preferred by the Israeli sociologist S. N. Eisenstadt, the
revolutionary ‘Jacobin’ state that appeared with the French
Revolution and the movements that surfaced in its wake, including
communism and fascism. According to Eisenstadt, the
fundamentalists appropriated some of the ‘central aspects of the
political program of modernity’, including its ‘participatory,
totalistic, and egalitarian orientations’ while rejecting the
117

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

The example of Buddhism in Sri Lanka clearly demonstrates that
none of the major religious traditions is immune from
fundamentalism, to which violence is closely linked, though it
might be better in this, as in most other contexts, to describe the
process as the ‘nationalization’ or secularization of religion. Donald
Swearer argues that by homogenizing the Buddhist tradition and
reducing it to a simpliﬁed core teaching along with a moralistic
programme of right living linked to Sinhalese Buddhist identity,
Bandaranaike (and his later successor President Jayawardine)
‘ignored the polar dynamic between the transmundane and the
mundane, a distinction basic not only to traditional Theravada
Buddhism but to the other great historical religions as well. The
absolutism of fundamentalism’, he concludes, ‘stems from this basic
transformation of the religious worldview.’ It is not religious in the
classical sense of that term but rather a variant of a secular faith
couched in religious language, in which ‘religious symbols are
stripped of their symbolic power to evoke a multiplicity of
meanings’.

Enlightenment values embedded in Jacobinism, including the
sovereignty and autonomy of reason and the perfectibility of man.
‘The basic structure or phenomenology of their vision and action’,
he concludes,
is in many crucial and seemingly paradoxical ways a modern one,
just as was the case with the totalitarian movements of the twenties
and thirties. These movements bear within themselves the seeds of
very intensive and virulent revolutionary sectarian, utopian
Jacobinism, seeds which can, under appropriate circumstances,

Fundamentalism

come to full-blown fruition.

Such movements have always had violent repercussions: before
developing its modern meaning of freelance or irregular military
action, the word ‘terrorist’ was applied to the Jacobin
revolutionaries in France who used the power of the state to inﬂict
terror on their enemies.
A common feature of all such movements may be found in the way
that religion has become secularized in many parts of the world,
even among people who claim to be resisting secularism. The
mythical images of cosmic struggle that form part of the religious
repertoire of the great traditions are being actualized or brought
down to earth. The cosmic struggle is understood to be occurring in
this world rather than in a mythical setting. Believers identify
personally with the struggle. All religions afﬁrm the primacy of
meaning and order over chaos; hence in treating of death and
violence, religions strive to contain them within an overarching,
benign cosmic frame. In the Baghavad Gita, the god Krishna tells
the warrior Arjuna that he must submit to his destiny in ﬁghting
against his own kinsmen. In so doing, he assents to the disorder of
the world, although the contestants know that in the grander sense,
this disorder is corrected by a cosmic order that is beyond killing
and being killed. Similarly, the Koran contains many allusions to
the Prophet Muhammad’s battles, which are set in the wider
context of a moral order deemed to be upheld by an all-seeing
118

benevolent God. For Christians, Jesus’s heroism in allowing himself
to endure an excruciatingly painful death is seen as a monumental
act of redemption for humankind, tipping the balance of power and
allowing the struggle for order to succeed.

Why is this happening in the 21st century? Why, when
modernization seemed to have made the God of Battles redundant,
if not dead, has religious violence resurfaced, like Dracula, from the
grave?

119

Fundamentalism and nationalism II

Religious images and texts provide ways in which violence, pain,
and death are overcome symbolically. Human suffering is made
more durable by the idea that death and pain are not pointless, that
lives are not wasted needlessly, but are part of a grander scheme in
which divinely constituted order reigns supreme above the chaos
and disorder of the world. In such a context, the horrors and chaos
of wars, as described in the Mahabharata and the Book of Joshua, as
debated in the Baghavad Gita, as predicted in the Book of
Revelation, and as alluded to in the Koran, are subsumed within an
order seen to be meaningful and ultimately benign. The reading
and recitation of such texts over the centuries, like the performance
of ancient Greek tragedies, doubtless had a carthartic function,
purging people of anger and rage, inducing pity and fear, reducing
actual conﬂict, upholding social harmony. By its rejection of
symbolic interpretations fundamentalism (at least in its politically
militant versions) releases the violence contained in the text.
Fundamentalism is religion materialized, the word made ﬂesh, as it
were, with the ﬂesh rendered, all too often, into shattered body
parts by the forces of holy rage.

Conclusion

The rise of urban civilization and the collapse of traditional
religion are the two main hallmarks of our era and are
closely related movements . . . What is secularization? . . . It
is the loosening of the world from religion and quasireligious understandings of itself . . . The gods of traditional
religions live on as private fetishes or the patrons of congenial groups, but they play no role whatever in the public
life of the secular metropolis . . . It will do no good to cling to
our religions and metaphysical version of Christianity in the
hope that one day religion or metaphysics will once again be
back. They are disappearing forever [emphasis added] and
that means we can now let go and immerse ourselves in the
new world of the secular city.
(Harvey Cox, The Secular City, 1965)

Until the mid-1970s, it was widely assumed that politics was
breaking away from religion and that as societies became more
industrialized, religious belief and practice would be restricted to
private thoughts and activities. The decline in the social and
political importance of religion in the West was grounded in the
social scientiﬁc traditions ﬂowing from the commanding ﬁgures of
120

Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber, all of whom insisted
in different ways that secularization was integral to modernization.
The processes of modern industrialism which Weber saw as being
characterized by depersonalized functional relationships and
increasing bureaucratization were leading, if not to the ﬁnal death
of God, at the least to the ‘disenchantment of the world’. The
numinous forces that had underpinned the medieval cosmos would
be psychologized, subjectivized, and demythologized.

By the early 1980s, however, it was becoming clear that religious
activism was very far from being conﬁned to the Islamic world and
that newly politicized movements were occurring in virtually every
major religious tradition. In America, the New Christian Right
(NCR) challenged and temporarily checked the boundaries of
church–state separation that had steadily been moving in a
secular direction. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe
has seen a marked resurgence in public religiosity, while Latin
America and parts of Africa appear to be undergoing far-reaching
religious transformations, with Pentecostalism overtaking
Catholicism as the dominant religious tradition. With Japan and
South Korea – Asia’s most advanced industrial economies –
ranking high in the list of countries nurturing new religious
movements, only secular Western Europe and Australasia, areas
that Martin Marty, the American historian of religion, calls the
‘spiritual ice-belt’, appear to be conforming to the demise of the
121

Conclusion

On the face of it, the 1979 revolution in Iran seriously dented
conventional wisdom. Here was a revolt deploying a repertoire of
religious symbols that brought down a modernizing government
and placed political power in the hands of a religious establishment
steeped in medieval theology and jurisprudence. Moreover, this was
clearly an urban, not a rural, phenomenon – a response, perhaps, to
over-rapid or uneven development, but not in any sense a
movement such as the counter-revolutionary movements in the
Vendée or the peasant jacqueries that challenged the secular project
of the French Revolution.

Fundamentalism

public deity so conﬁdently predicted by the founding fathers of
modern social science.
Various theories have been advanced to explain the persistence or
recent revival of religion, of which the fundamentalisms we have
been examining are an integral part. The two previous chapters
explored the close connections between religious revival
movements and nationalism. Where religion or in certain cases
religious difference is a vital component in the construction of
national identity or where religious feelings have been invoked in
the course of the struggle against colonialism, as in many Third
World countries, religious rhetoric retains its ability to mobilize and
motivate. Thus, without abandoning the secularization thesis
altogether, Jeff Haynes suggests that secularization continues to
make ‘sustained progress’ except when religion ﬁnds or retains
work to do other than its pre-modern function of ‘relating
individuals to the supernatural’. Haynes relates this paradoxically to
the postmodern rejection of metanarratives or absolute ways of
speaking truth.
‘Postmodernism’ is an enigmatic concept, whose very ambiguity
reﬂects the confusion and uncertainty inherent in contemporary
life. The term is applied in and to many diverse spheres of human
life and activity. It is important for politics as it decisively reﬂects the
end of belief in the Enlightenment project, the assumption of
universal progress based on reason, and in the modern Promethean
myth of humanity’s mastery of its destiny and capacity for resolution
of all its problems.

The relationship between fundamentalism and postmodernism is
paradoxical because far from rejecting absolute ways of speaking
truth, fundamentalisms exemplify them. The compliment
postmodernism pays to religion is back-handed and treacherous. By
proclaiming the end of positivism and the ideology of progress,
which was supposed to have replaced or overtaken religion,
postmodernism opens up public space for religion, but at the price
122

of relativizing its claims to absolute truth. By saying, in effect, ‘your
story is as good as mine, or his, or hers’, postmodernism allows
religious voices to have their say while denying their right to silence
others, as religions have tended to do throughout history. For the
true fundamentalist, the ‘post-‘ preﬁxed to modernism is a catch,
perhaps even a fraud, because modernity, in Anthony Gidden’s
formulation, is founded on the institutionalization of doubt. Far
from de-institutionalizing doubt, however, the pluralism implicit in
a postmodernist outlook sanctiﬁes it by opening the doors of choice,
which is the enemy of certainty.

Under modern conditions, an open question – ‘what is the proper
123

Conclusion

Theologically, fundamentalists must reject choice because they
know there is only one truth that has been revealed to them by the
supraempirical spiritual entity most of them call God. But the
contemporary situation under which this deity (or in some cases
deities) makes demands on them are utterly different from those
that prevailed in pre-modern times, when most people were
exposed to a single religious tradition within a cultural milieu
largely formed by that tradition. The situation facing Muslims living
in the West illustrates dilemmas that can be applied, with suitable
modiﬁcations, to believers in other faith traditions who may feel
ghettoized, or to those living as minorities in a globalized,
predominantly secular culture conditioned by technologies
originating in the post-Enlightenment West. For example, the
formalistic dos and don’ts of Islam as contained in a popular
compendium published by the fundamentalist Sheikh Yusuf
al-Qaradawi reveals the skeleton of Islamically correct behaviour
without showing the ﬂesh-and-blood context in which the Islamic
system of values used to operate. In a pluralistic world where
Muslims are obliged to live cheek-by-jowl with non-Muslim
neighbours, where almost everyone has access to televised images of
what used to be called the domain of war or unbelief (dar al-harb or
dar al-kufr), the modalities of everyday living acquire a signiﬁcance
they did not have before.

Fundamentalism

way to behave?’ – is replaced by a much narrower one: ‘how should
Muslims (or followers of other faith traditions) behave under
modern conditions?’, the implication being that for Muslims
nowadays the whole world has become dar al-harb because, even in
Muslim majority areas, ways of living differently from the straight
path prescribed by Islam are ever-present alternatives. In precolonial times, during the era of what might be called the ‘classical
Islamic hegemony’, the possibility of alternative non-Islamic
lifestyles simply did not arise for the majority of people. Where pork
is not available, no one has to make a decision about whether to eat
hot-dogs. Where wine was the preserve of a privileged elite who
drank it in the privacy of their palaces, the permissibility of alcohol
consumption was not a burning social question. In a homosocial
society where women were strictly segregated, lesbian and gay
relationships (though formally prohibited) were rarely seen as
threatening to the social order. Under pressures from outside forces,
all these issues, especially those involving sexual appearance and
behaviour, have acquired iconic signiﬁcance as marking boundaries
between the ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’, the ‘community of salvation’
and the ‘unsaved’ people who live beyond its boundaries. Thus, in
an archetypically Western milieu such as the American high school,
Muslim identity defaults to gender segregation, with veiled Muslim
coeds holding all-female proms in order to avoid breaking the taboo
on sexual mixing. Their evangelical Christian counterparts hold
assemblies of promise-keepers, who proclaim their commitment to
chastity before marriage and ﬁdelity afterwards. In a pluralistic
environment such as America, all religious groups will use
behavioural restrictions as a way of marking the boundaries
between believers and non-believers, between us (the saved) and
them (the damned). Mormons abstain from tea and coffee as well as
alcohol, so they are distinguishable from orthodox evangelicals,
who are mostly teetotal. Jehova’s Witnesses avoid blood
transfusions (and military service), Christian Scientists avoid
conventional medicine (because Christ is the only Healer), and
some Hasidic Jews (like some ultra-orthodox Muslims) exhibit
behaviour bordering on incivility by refusing to shake hands with
124

non-believers. Such behaviour is often described by those whom it
is designed to exclude as ‘fundamentalist’. One of the family
resemblances exhibited by movements in this book is the concern or
even obsession with the drawing of boundaries that will set the
group apart from the wider society by deliberately choosing beliefs
or modes of behaviour which proclaim who they are and how they
would like to be seen.

Fundamentalism is a truly modern phenomenon: modern in the
sense that the movement is always seeking original solutions to new,
pressing problems. Leaders are not merely constructing more rigid
orthodoxies in the name of defending old mythical orthodoxies. In
the process of undertaking restoration within contemporary
demographic/technological centres, new social orders are actually
being promulgated.

The born-again Christian ﬁnds comfort and support, not just by
internalizing the iconic ﬁgure of Jesus as a personal super-ego, but
also by accessing the support of fellow believers. Islamist
organizations such as Hamas are not just involved in armed
resistance to the Israeli occupation of their land but dispose of a
considerable range of welfare activities. As well as being places of
worship, churches, mosques, and synagogues are the hubs of social
networks. The intensive religiosity exhibited by fundamentalists in
all traditions may strengthen the support and increase the social
125

Conclusion

In this respect, fundamentalisms are distinctly modern
phenomena: like the New Religious Movements that have sprouted
in some of the most industrialized parts of the world (notably South
East Asia and North America), they feed on contemporary
alienation or anomie by offering solutions to contemporary
dilemmas, buttressing the loss of identities sustained by many
people (especially young people) at times of rapid social change,
high social and geographic mobility, and other stress-inducing
factors. As two well-known American observers, Anson Sharpe and
Jeffrey Hadden, put it:

Fundamentalism

opportunities the individual receives from such networks, though
there are perils here as well: in the absence of disciplined
hierarchies, disputes about the interpretation of texts makes
fundamentalists vulnerable to the splits that afﬂict most radical
movements.
Many fundamentalisms differ from cults or New Religious
Movements by their commitment to textual scripturalism. For
example, the focus of the Rajneesh community in Oregon and Pune
was on the person of Baghwan Shree Rajneesh, a charismatic cult
leader who drew eclectically on a wide variety of sources from
Hinduism, Buddhism, Christian and Islamic mysticism,
psychoanalysis, and psychotherapy, as well as personal spiritual
experience, in his teachings. A Christian fundamentalist such as
Jerry Falwell, by contrast, sticks closely to the inerrant text of the
Bible in his sermons. This distinction, however, should not be
drawn too sharply. David Koresh, the prophet of the Branch
Davidian sect of Seventh Day Adventism who perished along with
dozens of his followers at Waco, Texas, in April 1993, when his
compound was attacked by US federal agents, was a textual
fundamentalist as well as a charismatic leader who availed himself
of the sexual services of his female followers in order to ‘spread his
seed’. Far from being the result of brain-washing or mind-control
techniques, the charismatic power he exercised over his followers
was the result of their conviction that he was a divinely inspired
interpreter of biblical passages (particularly the Book of Revelation)
that are central to the Seventh Day Adventist tradition. During the
prolonged negotiations preceding the federal attack on the Waco
compound after a 51-day siege, the FBI negotiators dismissed
Koresh’s sermonizing as mere ‘Bible babble’. To his followers,
however, his discourses on the Christian apocalypse were both
meaningful and pregnant with religious insight.
As these and many other examples suggest, it is not just religious
movements designated as fundamentalist which have come to
challenge the secularization thesis so conﬁdently proclaimed by
126

Harvey Cox in the 1960s when he was Professor of Divinity at
Harvard. According to Anson Shupe and Jeffrey Hadden, the forces
of secularization, rather than being unidirectional, are part of a
dialectical process: ‘the economic and secular forces of so-called
modernization contain the very seeds of a reaction that brings
religion back into the heart of concerns about public policy’. There
is an abundance of evidence to support this view in North America,
where the New Christian Right is actively engaged in Republican
politics. The same dialectical logic, however, also limits the
potential of fundamentalists to transform society in the direction
they want. As already noted, in order to maximize their electoral
appeal, fundamentalists in a democracy must compartmentalize
their theology and form alliances with other conservative religious
groups such as Mormons, Catholics, and conservative Jews whom
they must perforce regard as inﬁdels. This not only dilutes the
127

Conclusion

Fundamentalism

religious aspect of the message, which is to convert non-believers;
the very act of compartmentalization, of separating the religious
from the political, undermines the fundamentalist agenda of
bringing back God into politics.
A similar logic applies to television, the most conspicuous of the
technologies used by fundamentalists in America. By means of
television, ‘televangelists’ such as Pat Robertson seek to challenge
the secular order, by re-enchanting the world with divine
interventions and supernatural events. Robertson and the late Oral
Roberts have performed healings on camera, even claiming to heal
viewers through their sets. In such programmes the sacred is
reafﬁrmed, after being banished from secular networks, or at best
restricted to the realm of ﬁction. The process of modernization
described by Weber in his famous phrase ‘the disenchantment of
the world’ is reversed. Through television, the world is re-enchanted
and resacralized.
At the same time, the counter-attack on secular values mounted
through religious television may prove subject to the law of
diminishing returns. Through television the sacred and
supernatural are domesticated, and ultimately banalized. In the
end, disenchantment continues under the guise of the new
religiosity. In the studio the charismatic leader who speaks for God
must put himself under the control of the director and camera
crew. Sacred words may be lost in cyberspace or disappear on
the cutting-room ﬂoor. The structure of authority becomes
ambiguous.
Television, mixing fact and ﬁction within a common format,
collapses mythos and logos, especially in cultures where the
conventions of theatre and ﬁction have recently been imported. In
India, movie stars who played divine beings in religious epics have
turned themselves into politicians. The Ayodhya agitation referred
to in Chapter 6 was boosted by television showings of the
Ramayana; in the communal rioting that followed, Hindu and
128

Muslim agitators stirred up mutual hostility by showing videos of
their co-religionists under attack.

The increase in religious militancy, occurring in many traditions in
deﬁance of the secularization thesis, may be related to the
increasing power and accessibility of audiovisual media, but the
long-term consequences are ambiguous. In the ﬁrst instance, the
fundamentalist impulse in many traditions has been a reaction to
the invasive quality of ﬁlm and television, which exposes sacred
areas like sexual relations to public gaze, bringing transgressive
images into the home. During the Islamist campaign in Algeria,
technicians had their throats slit for ﬁtting satellite dishes that
would bring into Muslim homes images of the Satanic West,
including semi-pornographic material from Italy and the
Netherlands, as well as factual news channels. In America
televangelists such as Falwell and Robertson fought back against
the perceived secularization of the culture by creating their own
religious programmes and television networks.
With the development of satellite networks such as the al-Jazeera
129

Conclusion

In the 700 Club, the supernatural is not just appropriated: it is
routinized and domesticated, formatted into regular 15- to
20-minute slots. In normal parlance, a supernatural event is by
deﬁnition unpredictable and awe-inspiring, since natural laws have
been suspended or superseded. Yet on the 700 Club, healings and
other supernatural interventions, in which the divine is presumed
to have acted on matter by the invocation of the Holy Spirit through
prayer, occur so frequently as to be almost banal. In the community
of the saved, as exhibited on CBN, God routinely suspends natural
laws and processes. The miraculous is thus not so much a
manifestation of the inexplicable Power of the Almighty, as the
ritual conﬁrmation of a belief-system that challenges the
conventions of secular medical science. Like the Bible itself, the
miraculous acts as a shibboleth or totem, reinforcing the identity of
the group.

channel based in Qatar, state-funded broadcasting monopolies are
losing their ability to impose censorship and control information. In
the least-developed regions, even more radical forces for change are
at work, as the audiovisual revolution undercuts the authority of the
literate elites. Societies such as Iran and India where levels of
literacy have been low have moved from the oral to the audiovisual
era without experiencing the revolution in literacy that generated
both Protestantism and the Enlightenment in Europe.

Fundamentalisms have beneﬁted from the revolution in
communications in two ways. First, radio broadcasts and television
images, which are now accessible to the majority of people on this
planet, make people much more aware of issues with which they
can identify than was the case in the past. They increase the
political temperature and add to perceptions of cultural conﬂict. An
obvious example is the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict. Viewers
throughout the Muslim world are enraged by the sight of Israeli
soldiers killing and humiliating Palestinians, while viewers in the
West, shocked and dismayed by the carnage inﬂicted by suicide
bombers, are liable to have anti-Arab or anti-Muslim prejudices
conﬁrmed.
131

Conclusion

Clearly, the revolution in communications has a bearing on the
failure of the secularization thesis as promulgated by Cox and
others. Where levels of literacy are low, the audio and video cassette
have enabled charismatic religious ﬁgures such as Sheikh Qaradawi
on al-Jazeera and the late Ayatollah Khomeini to acquire massive
followings. Osama bin Laden’s carefully crafted videos
disseminated by al-Jazeera have contributed to his image as the
archetypical Islamic hero. Audiovisual technologies restore the
power of word and gesture, the traditional province of religion, to a
new type of leader, undercutting the hegemony of bureaucrats and
the traditional religious professionals whose source of information
and power was the written word. When relayed on tape or
television, the power of orality and the languages of ritual and
gesture retain their potency.

Fundamentalism

16. The remains of an Israeli bus after a suicide bombing

As numerous media theorists have pointed out, television is not the
same as propaganda. It does not have a unidirectional or
homogenizing impact on viewers. Most viewers bring pre-existing
knowledge to what they see and hear on television, decoding images
according to their prejudices. In the Muslim world, images of Israeli
oppression may be reinforced by perceived differences in lifestyles.
For example, the explicit sexual interactions to be seen on a Tel Aviv
beach may add to Islamist perceptions that Palestinians are facing
not just a racist enemy that discriminates against them, but one that
is wholly evil because of its pagan (jahili) social attitudes. Secondly,
as explained already, fundamentalists beneﬁt from the
para-personal, electronically ampliﬁed relationships between
charismatic leaders and their audiences. Nasser and Hitler were
both beneﬁciaries of the new medium of radio; both Khomeini and
bin Laden seem to be iconically impressive ﬁgures able to convey
the solemnity, gravitas, nobility, and asceticism Muslims associate
with the aniconic image of the Prophet Muhammad.
But if fundamentalist movements beneﬁt from the media
revolution, they are also liable to be among its casualties. The
132

development of satellite television and increasing access to the
internet is bringing an end to the information monopolies on which
fundamentalists, like other authoritarian movements, depend. In
certain contexts, such as Israel-Palestine and Iraq after the AngloAmerican invasion, armed resistance to an externally imposed
authority, publicized by the media, is regarded as legitimate by a
signiﬁcant number of people. Under such circumstances (which
usually ﬁt the category of religious nationalism, rather than pure
fundamentalism), the terrorists or martyrs may become heroes. But
where religious radicals have tried to impose their will by violence,
as in Egypt, the publicity they court by indulging in the propaganda
of the deed may result in popular revulsion, especially in the pious
middle-class constituencies on which they depend for support.

The future is nonetheless precarious. Soon two Islamist regimes,
Iran and Pakistan, could be armed with nuclear weapons, a
prospect made more dangerous by the strand of apocalyptic fantasy
that excites and inspires the children of Abraham. In IsraelPalestine, following the triumph of Hamas in the elections to the
Palestinian National Authority, Islamists are challenging not only
the Israeli occupation, but the authority of the Palestinian leaders
who signed the Oslo Accords with the Jewish state in 1993. Within
three years, at this writing, an Iranian regime with nuclear capacity
could be supporting the Palestinians in the next round of the
intifada against Israel. Since the latter already has its nuclear
weapons, the stage will be set for the Armageddon predicted and
welcomed by premilliennialists as the necessary prelude to the
return of Christ. The gloomy prognosis might be applied, a fortiori,
to Pakistan, an economic and social disaster zone when compared
133

Conclusion

Where Islamists have succeeded in taking power, as in Iran, satellite
technology tells against them, since it becomes impossible for them
to sustain their monopoly over the religious discourse. Sacred texts
such as the Koran have endured because they transcend ideologies,
speaking to the human condition in language that is always open to
alternative interpretations.

Fundamentalism

with its rival, the polytheist or pagan India. More ominously even
than in Israel-Palestine, the apocalyptic mood in Pakistan centres
on the Islamic bomb, to which there are now ﬂower-decked shrines
in major cities. Like the attacks on New York and Washington,
which like other cities in the Satanic West face the prospect of
terrorist attacks with dirty bombs (conventional explosives
containing radioactive materials capable of spreading radiation
over a large area), Pakistani bomb-worship may be a manifestation
of nihilistic theological despair. Polytheist India ﬂourishes
compared with rightly-guided Pakistan. So do inﬁdel countries like
South Korea and Japan. Since the God of Manifest Success who
rewarded Muhammad on the ﬁeld of battle has so signally failed to
deliver, we must kill ourselves, taking with us as many of our
enemies as we can.
The attacks of 9/11 revealed the dangers of this apocalyptic outlook.
The leaders were not ignorant young men from a deprived region of
the world protesting against economic injustices, but privileged
enragés who could have expected to achieve high-status jobs in
ﬁelds like medicine, engineering, and architecture. Their rage was
theological: the God of Battles who looms so largely in the
Abrahamic imagination had let them down disastrously. Their faith
in the benign and compassionate deity of Islam had begun to
wobble. Their ﬁnal act was not a gesture of Islamic heroism, but of
Nietzschean despair. The same mentality exists in the Western
branch of what is often called ‘fundamentalism’ but might be better
described as ‘Abrahamic apocalypticism’. Christian
premillennialists are theological refugees in a world they no longer
control. In America, fortunately, their avenues of expression usually
fall short of violence (though there have been physical attacks by
fundamentalists on doctors performing abortions). However they
have a baleful inﬂuence on American foreign policy, by tilting it
towards the Jewish state, which they aim eventually to obliterate by
converting righteous Jews to Christ. They have damaged the
education of American children in some places by adding scientiﬁc
creationism, or its successor ‘intelligent design’, to the curriculum.
134

They inconvenience some women especially poor women with
limited access to travel by making abortion illegal in certain states.
On a planetary level, they are selﬁsh, greedy, and stupid, damaging
the environment by the excessive use of energy and lobbying against
environmental controls. What is the point of saving the planet, they
argue, if Jesus is arriving tomorrow?
American fundamentalists are a headache, a thorn in ﬂesh of the
bien-pensant liberals, the subject of bemused concern to Old
Europeans who have experienced too many real catastrophes to
yearn for Armageddon. Whatever spiritual beneﬁts individuals may
have gained by taking Jesus as their personal saviour, the
apocalyptic fantasies harboured by born-again Christians have a
negative effect on public policy. Because of its impact on the
environment and its baleful role in the Middle East, America’s
religiosity is a problem.

The Islamic situation is different, because for historical and
sociological reasons too complex to explain in this book, very few
Muslim political cultures have developed along democratic lines. In
their ruthless drive to power, Islamists have succeeded in taking
control of the state temporarily in Sudan, Pakistan, and
Afghanistan and permanently in Saudi Arabia and (under different
sectarian colours) in Iran. Where the Islamist tide has receded or
been checked (as in Pakistan, Egypt, and Algeria), it has been
ruthless action by the military rather than the constraints of
135

Conclusion

But the solution is also American. The constitutional separation of
church and state is as fundamental to American democracy as the
Bible is to fundamentalists. The hard line preached by
televangelists such as Falwell and Robertson is protected by the
First Amendment, but it is also limited by it. Though
fundamentalists can inﬂuence policy, they cannot control it. The
same considerations apply, by and large, to fundamentalists in
Israel, Sri Lanka, and India, who are constrained by the pluralistic
and democratic political systems in which they operate.

democratic institutions that have protected secular government.
The association of religious pluralism and secularism with
militarism (as in Syria, Pakistan, and Turkey) rather than with
democracy has been an important element in the Islamist rhetorical
armoury.

Fundamentalism

Where the military governs along secular lines, as in Algeria or in
Turkey during periods of army intervention, Islamists can plausibly
appeal to democratic feelings. But where Islamists actually hold
power, as in Iran, they resist democratic progress as being contrary
to the will of God. There are ways out of this vicious spiral, but they
require ﬁne political tuning. An example is offered by Turkey, where
in order to win democratically Islamists have had to abandon their
more strident demands for ‘re-Islamizing’ society.
Despite these very real problems, the call for freedom, even when
polluted by the suspicion that it is being exploited by commercial
interests, still runs with the grain of popular aspirations. Islamism,
like other fundamentalisms, works best in opposition. In power it
proves no less susceptible to corruption or manipulation than the
ideologies and systems it seeks to supplant. For the foreseeable
future, Muslim nationalists will doubtless continue to resist
American global hegemony, along with Russian imperialism in
Transcaucasia and the Israeli subjugation of Palestine. But in other
respects, the power of modern technology may be working in
America’s direction. In the age of satellite broadcasting and the
internet, pluralism and diversity of choice are no longer aspirations.
They are dynamic realities with which believers of all traditions are
having to contend.
