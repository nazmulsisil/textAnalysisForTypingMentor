Preface

The title of this book may suggest a survey of problems in philosophy or
physics: whether time can have a beginning or an end; whether the laws
of space–time cease altogether to apply in black holes; whether it
would ever be possible to reverse the ﬂow and change the past – a
favourite fantasy with people who imagine that they alone would have
the privilege of doing so, and forget that in the new improved past their
parents might never have met.
These are indeed good questions, but no more my concern than the
deﬁnition of time. About ad 268 the great Neoplatonist philosopher
Plotinus observed that while we constantly talk about age and time as if
we had a clear idea of what they were, when we investigate the question
we ﬁnd ourselves puzzled. The point was pithily restated some 130 years
later by St Augustine: ‘So what is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I
seek to explain it, I do not.’
No pretence to greater wisdom is made in this book; whether time is a
fourth dimension of the universe or a reiﬁed abstraction, whether it is
continuous or atomistic, whether it can exist independently of motion to
be measured, whether any meaning attaches to ‘before’ in the phrase
‘before Creation’ or ‘before the Big Bang’, are for others to determine.
The same St Augustine, faced with the question what God was doing
before he created the world, quoted, though he did not endorse, the
jocular answer, ‘Preparing hells for folk who invented clever

conundrums like that’; I shall not take the chance that a true word was
spoken in jest.
Nor shall I consider whether time proceeds in a straight line or in cycles.
Although it is not true that linear time was a Judaeo-Christian
speciality, set against the cyclical time symbolized in late Graeco-Roman
paganism as a serpent devouring its tail, some philosophers did speak of
time in cyclical terms. That poses conceptual problems that I shall not
discuss; rather I shall conﬁne myself to time in its ordinary-language or
man-in-the-street sense, and shall concentrate on the methods by which
its passage is and has been measured.
The English word ‘time’ may refer to a more or less closely deﬁned
period, from ‘a short time’, meaning not very long, to ‘the time of the
Pharaohs’, some three thousand years; it may also refer to the ‘indeﬁnite
continuous duration’, as the Oxford English Dictionary expresses it, in
which all events have taken place, are taking place, and will take place.
This notion, the focus of Plotinus’ and St Augustine’s perplexity,
presupposes a developed capacity for abstract thought; not only are
various primitive peoples reported by anthropologists not to have such a
concept of time, but in the epics ascribed to ‘Homer’ and dating from the
8th to 7th centuries bc that the Greeks regarded as the foundation of
their culture, chrónos denotes only a lapse of time, not what we are
tempted to think of as time itself. Nevertheless it already has that sense
in the great Athenian lawgiver Solon of the early 6th century bc, who
personiﬁes it as a judge: ‘in the court of Time’. Since then, this concept
of indeﬁnite continuous duration has been so familiar a concept to
Western civilization that we ﬁnd its absence unimaginable in any
advanced culture; yet the case has recently been argued that neither the
Hebrew Bible nor rabbinical literature displays it. However, in any but
the simplest society, even if people are unaware of time as a thing in
itself, they need to measure it. This book is about the methods by which
the passage of time has been measured.
Homer has terms for years, months, and days; his references to
disputes and lawsuits remind us of one important context for time-

measurement, namely that even in his relatively simple society some
cases must have turned, not on whether something had happened, but
on whether it had happened before something else. If the two events
had been witnessed by the same persons, there might be no problem; if
not, both might be related to some third event, preferably one known to
both parties and the judge, such as the local magnate’s wedding. If there
were no such event, difﬁculties would ensue unless the facts of the case
could be plotted against a socially accepted measure of time.
The recording and coordination of human activities make it necessary
to devise systems for relating events to a sequence of regular and
predictable natural recurrences; since these systems were of artiﬁcial
contrivance, and evolved in partial or complete independence one from
another, they are different in many details. The range of variation,
however, is limited by facts of nature, in particular the earth’s rotation
on its axis, the moon’s revolution round the earth, and the earth’s
revolution round the sun; it is these that underlie the most widespread
units for measuring time, the day, month, and year respectively.
The more complex life becomes, the more sophistication is demanded of
the intellect not merely to distinguish one year, month, day, or
subdivision of the day from another (the science of time-measurement),
but to relate the years and so forth thus distinguished to each other (the
science of chronology). This latter includes comparing the systems
established for this purpose by different cultures to determine whether
two apparently similar designations refer to two different things, or the
same thing is lurking under two different names.
In much time-measurement ﬁdelity to nature is in conﬂict with
convenience; sometimes the former is sacriﬁced, as has repeatedly
happened in Western methods of telling the time of day, sometimes the
latter, as when Pope Gregory XIII made the Roman calendar more
accurate but also more complex. By contrast, the designation of the year
is free of natural considerations, being entirely a matter of convention;
nevertheless, it is all too easily reiﬁed. In the early months of 1961 a
manufacturer of electrical goods is said to have advertised its products

in the name of a housewife called ‘Mrs 1961’, who because she was Mrs
1961 had to have the latest vacuum cleaner and the latest refrigerator.
Her reward for thus increasing the company’s sales was to disappear
without trace in 1962.
Mrs 1961 was a victim of the delusion that years measured in our
particular calendar and numbered in our particular era possess a reality
beyond the conventions that created them. Yet in other calendars the
year 1961 of the Christian era was not even a self-contained whole: in
one Indian era it combined portions of 1882 and 1883, in another of
2017 and 2018, in Ethiopia of 1953 and 1954, in the Jewish calendar of
5721 and 5722, in the Muslim calendar of 1380 and 1381.
Such reiﬁcation extends to larger units. ‘The Sixties’, meaning the 1960s,
marks an entire decade as a time of political rebellion and cultural
innovation; the 1890s (during which Oscar Wilde was convicted) are
called ‘the Naughty Nineties’ because the elite chafed at the pretence of
conforming to middle-class respectability. Centuries too are branded:
‘in the 15th century religious devotion became increasingly personal and
emotional’, ‘18th-century English literature was dictated by the head
and not the heart’ – as if on the ﬁrst day of 1401 or 1701 (not necessarily
1 January, as we shall see in Chapter 7), old ways of thought and feeling
were abandoned like Mrs 1961’s old vacuum cleaner.
When the emperor Trajan admonished Pliny, perhaps late in ad 110,
that receipt of anonymous accusations was not compatible with ‘our
times’, he meant quite speciﬁcally ‘my reign’, the principles by which he
chose to rule. By contrast, modern journalists and politicians tell us that
certain practices of government (though not that one) have no place in
the 21st century, as if the date were a fact of nature and a legislator, so
solidly is it reiﬁed. One purpose of this book is to combat such
reiﬁcation by illustrating the contingent and arbitrary nature of the
measures to which it is applied.
Although the subject of this book is not politics or religion, I shall as
occasion serves consider the political and religious implications in the

choice of calendar, and the acceptance or rejection of reforms (e.g. the
Gregorian calendar in Christendom, the ‘Shahänshahi’ era in Iran):
even when the Government of India, in 1957, introduced a new secular
calendar, it did not dare touch the multiplicity of religious calendars
beyond substituting the synodic for the sidereal year. I shall also devote
one chapter to a religious festival, the Christian Easter, not because of its
religious signiﬁcance but because of its calendrical complexity.
Nevertheless, my concern is with calendars as such rather than with
their use or meaning; likewise, though much may be written about time
as a social construct – and constructor – or about its perception by
young and old, by men and women, or by ofﬁce workers, factory hands,
and peasants, there are others more qualiﬁed to write it.
Technical terms, when unavoidable, will be explained in a glossary;
however, I note here that I have occasionally employed the single words
‘feria’, ‘quantième’, ‘lune’, and ‘millésime’ in place of the lengthier
phrases ‘day of the week’, ‘day of the month’, ‘day of the lunar month’,
and ‘number of the year’. Numbers have been written in the scientiﬁc
fashion, without commas: one thousand is 1000, ten thousand 10 000,
one ten-thousandth 0.0001, one hundred-thousandth 0.000 01.
The traditional terms ad and bc have been retained, in preference to ce
and bce, for two reasons: adopting the latter causes the maximally
distinguished bc 1 and 1 ad to become the minimally distinguished
1 bce and 1 ce; and although, as a date for the birth of Jesus Christ the
epoch is almost certainly wrong, it remains a commemoration of that
event, and no other event of the same year can be proposed as an
alternative of world signiﬁcance. Attractive, especially in a globalized
age, as a purely secular era may appear, the Christian era cannot be
made secular by denying its origin.

Chapter 1
The day

Natural, artiﬁcial, civil day
The most fundamental unit of time-measurement is in most
societies the period of the earth’s rotation on its axis, which is
normally known as the day. Unfortunately this word and its
equivalents in other languages are ambiguous: other meanings
apart, they may denote either the light period (daytime) as opposed
to the night, or the combination of daytime and night. In some
cultures, this combination is termed the night, as it used to be by
Celtic and Germanic peoples, who measured the length of journeys
or campaigns by the periods of inaction during darkness; this
practice – to which we still revert when booking a hotel – survives in
the English word ‘fortnight’, meaning 14 nights (formerly too in
‘sennight’, meaning a week). Nevertheless, the prevailing word is ‘day’.
The two senses, ‘daylight’ and ‘period of rotation’, are distinguished
by the Latin author Censorinus, writing in ad 238, as dies naturalis
and dies civilis respectively; by the 7th century, however, educated
opinion had decided that the true day was the combined entity. As a
result, it was the latter that was called dies naturalis, the daytime
being renamed dies artiﬁcialis; accordingly Chaucer speaks of the
sun’s ‘artiﬁcial day’ in the introduction to the Man of Law’s Tale. It
is in this fashion that the terms ‘natural’ and ‘artiﬁcial’ day will be
used in this book.
1

The History of Time

In principle the natural day, being a segment of a continuum, may
begin at any time. Some languages have an everyday word for a
24-hour period irrespective of starting point (e.g. Dutch etmaal,
Russian sutki, Swedish dygn); this is particularly useful in
measuring the duration of sea voyages, which unlike land journeys
are not interrupted by nightfall. English has no corresponding term
except the rare and scientiﬁc nychthemeron, a Greek word, literally
meaning ‘night-day’, used by St Paul when he tells the Corinthians
‘a night and a day have I been in the deep’ (2 Cor. 11: 25). The New
English Bible, anxious to avoid the implication that his ordeal
began at sunset, renders ‘for twenty-four hours’.
This unanchored natural day must be distinguished from the civil
day in the strict sense, which is the natural day as reckoned from a
particular point determined by law or custom. In the modern West,
following Roman practice, and also in China, that point is
midnight, but the Jewish and Muslim day is counted from sunset, as
it was by the ancient Greeks and Babylonians; so (despite the
midnight services that introduce Easter and Christmas) is the
Christian liturgical day. The Egyptians (though not the Greeks of
Egypt) reckoned from sunrise; in the same spirit most people in our
own society, after midnight, call the next artiﬁcial day ‘tomorrow’
not ‘today’. (In many languages, including English, the word for
‘tomorrow’ is related to that for ‘morning’, or is even the same, like
Spanish mañana.) The peoples of ancient Umbria, however, began
the day at noon, which struck the Romans as absurd. Noon was also
the traditional beginning of the astronomical and nautical day,
allowing all observations relating to a single night to fall on the
same date; modern astronomers and sailors, however, have adopted
the civil day.

Natural and social divisions
The apparent progress of the sun through the heavens can be
measured, in the less cloudy climates, by observing the position or
length of its shadow. It is recorded in the Bible that when, in the late
2

8th century bc, King Hezekiah of Judah fell ill, the prophet Isaiah
induced a miraculous retreat of the sun’s shadow by ten steps on an
instrument evidently set up by the king’s father, ‘the steps of Ahaz’.
Although the Authorized or King James Version speaks of ‘degrees’
on a ‘dial’ – meaning a sundial, not a clockface – the Hebrew word
remains the same, ma ălôt; more recent interpreters have
supposed the steps to be a staircase or terrace, installed for use or
beauty without regard to timekeeping. This would suit better with
later midrashim, or elaborations of biblical stories, in which a
scratch is made in the wall and a prophecy given that when the
sun’s shadow reaches the mark, such-and-such an event will take
place.

The hour
By contrast, the ancient Egyptians had for many centuries divided
both the artiﬁcial day and the night into 12 ‘hours’ each; in the
former case, there was an earlier division into 10 hours of daytime
plus 2 hours of half-light. The daytime hours were measured with
shadow-clocks and sundials, those of the night identiﬁed by the
succcessive risings of constellations. Every 10 days, a new
constellation was recognized as rising with the sun (on each of the
9 succeeding days it rose 4 minutes earlier), yielding a set of 36
constellations known in Greek as dekanoí; this word, Anglicized as
‘decan’, was also used for an ofﬁcer with 10 men under him, giving
rise to our ‘dean’ and ‘doyen’. For each 10-day period the decan that
rose nearest to dawn, and the beginning of each hour, was noted in
3

The day

These are not times of day as we understand them, any more than
cock-crow or the natural and social events used as markers in
Homer – ‘when the early-born, rosy-ﬁngered Dawn appeared’,
‘when the sun made his way towards ox-loosing’, ‘when a man rises
for his supper after judging many disputes’ – and long afterwards in
the expositions of Jewish law known as the Mishnah; even midday
and midnight are rather bands than points of time, halfway
between sunrise and sunset or vice versa.

‘diagonal calendars’, so called because each decan was one line
higher from one column to the next (see Figure 1).
Such hours, technically called unequal or seasonal because they
vary in length according to the time of year, were adopted by the
Hellenistic Greeks and Romans (though the latter often divided the
night into four vigiliae, or watches), and survived in normal use
until the later Middle Ages. That is why Jesus, in St John’s Gospel,
asks ‘Are there not twelve hours in the day?’, meaning the artiﬁcial
day. It is also why a midday rest is known as a siesta, Old Spanish
for ‘sixth’, that is the sixth hour of the day (see box).

The History of Time

Ancient numbering of hours
• When it is said that on the day of the Cruciﬁxion ‘from the
sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the
ninth hour’, this means from midday till mid-afternoon.
Similarly, a Greek epigram states that there are 6 hours for
working; the next 4 are for living, because the Greek letters zeta, eta, theta, iota, which were the normal notation
for the numbers 7, 8, 9, and 10, spell the word zêthi, ‘live!’
• The ecclesiastical ofﬁces of terce and nones owe their
names to Latin tertia and nona, the 3rd and 9th hour
respectively. However, a tendency to sing ofﬁces earlier
than prescribed caused noon, the older form of ‘nones’, to
mean ‘midday’; the new sense is well established by the
14th century.

Although astronomers divided the natural day (reckoned from
midday) into 24 equal, or equinoctial, hours, called by the latter name
because at the equinoxes the nights and days are equal, other folk
4

The History of Time

preferred the seasonal variety, which so long as work and travel were
conﬁned to daylight indicated both the time consumed and the
time remaining. There were tables for converting the equal hours
naturally measured by the clepsydra, or water-clock, into the unequal
hours read off the sundial; not even the mechanical clock, which
spread in Europe from the 14th century, gave immediate supremacy
to equal hours, for the more complex clocks sometimes indicate
unequal hours alongside the date and the position of sun and moon.
Once equal hours became the norm, however, it was more
convenient to count them from midnight or midday than from
sunrise or sunset; for that reason, people began to count the
two sets of 12 hours before and after midday. Especially in
English-speaking countries, this remains the norm outside
bureaucratic and military usage, which favours the unambiguous
count from 0 to 24. In Italy, however, there was a single sequence of
24 hours from sunset, the clock being adjusted from time to time as
sunset moved later or earlier in the year; even now, when hours are
counted from midnight, Italians freely use the 24-hour reckoning in
everyday conversation. English-speakers do not arrange to meet for
lunch ‘at 13 hours’ instead of ‘one o’clock’, meaning 1 p.m., but ‘alle
tredici’ is not in the least pretentious in Italian.
A variant on these ‘Italian hours’ characteristic of Majorca was a
24-hour sequence counted from dawn; these are known as
‘Babylonian hours’, from a false opinion in ancient authors that the
Babylonian day began at sunrise. In fact, it began at sunset; night
and artiﬁcial day were each divided into three ‘watches’, each in
turn divided into four ‘parts’ or seasonal hours (see Figure 2); but
the natural day was divided either (as we shall see) into 60ths, or
into 12 kaspu, one for each sign of the zodiac, occasionally called
hôrai in Greek, but commonly now known from a Eurocentric point
of view as ‘double hours’.
Double hours were adopted by the Chinese in 102 bc, displacing a
previous division into 10 parts. The decree establishing the French

revolutionary calendar also envisaged a decimal division of the day
into 10 hours, each of 100 minutes, themselves each of 100 seconds,
to take effect on 1 vendémiaire year III (22 September 1794).
Although the scheme would prove impractical, 10-hour clockfaces
were made (see Figure 3).

Smaller divisions
The arithmetic of ancient Babylon was based on the number 60;
accordingly, astronomers (despite the existence of double hours)
divided the natural day into 60 parts, these parts in turn into 60ths,
and so on. The length of the synodic month, for instance, was
estimated at 29 days + 31/60 + 50/3600 + 8/216 000 + 20/
12 960 000, which modern scholars write as 29;31,50,8,20 days.

(outer ring) and 10 hours (inner ring)

Greek astronomers divided the natural day into 24 equinoctial
hours, each of 15 moîrai or ‘parts’, the same word as they used for
degrees of arc, since in either case there were 360 parts to the
whole (Ptolemy, in the 2nd century ad, preferred to speak of
‘equinoctial times’); we also ﬁnd stigmē´, ‘point’, used for half a
moîra.
8

More complex systems are found in post-classical texts, both Greek
and Latin (see box). Yet although small units were useful for
astronomical and astrological purposes, or for displaying erudition,
such conceptual division outran practical measurement, for
there was no way of isolating atoms of time, 22 560 or 25 920
of the hour.
The neuter adjective minutum, ‘tiny thing’, was variously used for
1/15 hour (4 min.), 1/10 hour (6 min.), and 1/60 day (24 min.);
but it never denoted 1/60 hour, which was an ostentum. In the
later Middle Ages, however, we ﬁnd a new sexagesimal division
of the hour into primae, secundae, and tertiae minutae (partes
understood). This system, already used for degrees of arc, has
given rise to our ‘minutes’ and ‘seconds’; ‘third minutes’, or
60ths of the second, abbreviated ′′′, have largely given way to
decimals.

The triumph of the clock over the sundial as the preferred
instrument for measuring time brought about a further change,
besides the adoption of equinoctial hours: the displacement of
the apparent solar time shown on the sundial by mean solar time
shown on the clock. If the earth’s orbit were a circle with the sun
at its centre, and if its axis of rotation were perpendicular to that
orbit, there would be no difference; but since the earth’s orbit is
elliptical, and the axis of rotation is inclined, the length of the
natural day, measured against the 24 equinoctial hours of the
clock, varies by half an hour over the course of the year. The
difference between apparent and mean solar time is known as
the equation of time; when apparent solar time is ahead of
mean, the value is positive, when behind it is negative (see
Figure 4).

4. Equation of time

The standardization of time

Accordingly, the railway companies drew up their timetables, and
set their station clocks, in accordance with Greenwich Mean Time,
measured from a brass line at the Royal Observatory. Despite
objections, not merely from certain civic dignitaries, but even from
the Astronomer Royal, on the ground that if the clock said noon
when the sun was not overhead it was lying, the new standardized
time prevailed, and in 1880 was enshrined in statute. So completely
has local time been forgotten that the tradition still observed at
11

The day

Even when mean solar time had been adopted for purposes of legal
deﬁnition (as in 1792 by Great Britain), it still varied with the local
meridian: for every 15′ of longitude that one place lies to the east of
another, the same nominal time arrives one minute earlier. So long
as transport was conﬁned to horse-drawn or water-borne trafﬁc,
and communication to the speed of horse or bird, that did not
matter; but in the 19th century it made no sense that a train
travelling at a given speed so many miles due west should appear to
complete them sooner than one travelling at the same speed an
equal number of miles due east, or that a telegraph message
transmitted from east to west should appear to arrive before it had
been sent.

Christ Church, Oxford, that one is not late till ﬁve minutes past the
appointed time, that is to say till one is late by local mean solar time
(longitude 1° 15′ W.) as well as Greenwich, is regarded even in other
Oxford colleges as no more than an amiable eccentricity.

The History of Time

Time zones
Other countries similarly standardized their time; but while that
was good enough for railway companies, it was not good enough
for the international telegraph, which needed, if not a single time
throughout the world, at least a single standard to which all local
times could be referred. Since the globalization of trade and
transport had made it convenient that all maps and charts should
indicate the same longitudes in whichever country they were
produced, as being so many degrees east or west of a prime
meridian, this prime meridian would also yield the standard time.
In October 1884 an International Meridian Conference at
Washington, DC adopted a US proposal that the prime meridian
should be that ‘passing through the centre of the transit instrument
at the Observatory of Greenwich’; this has been the norm ever since,
though for many years afterwards French maps continued to show
0° at Paris. (As a sop, the Conference adopted a French proposal for
research into decimal measurement of angles and time.) In
consequence, Greenwich time became the universal standard of
reference, all other times being stated as so many hours ahead
of or behind it. Again, the French proved resistant, ultimately
succumbing only in 1911 and even then saving face by deﬁning
legal time as Paris Mean Time minus 9 minutes 21 seconds.
A few impractical extremists wished to make Greenwich Mean
Time the universal civil time as well; but while the objections of
science or superstition to a clock that read midday some ten
minutes too soon or too late might be summarily overruled, it was
not the same when at this nominal midday the sun was on the
horizon, or the sky was pitch-black. Instead – since time of day,
12

unlike season, is not affected by latitude – the globe is divided into
vertical bands, known as time zones, running between the poles.
Their boundaries are somewhat irregular (see Figure 5), owing to
political factors such as state borders or the decision of Iceland to
adopt Greenwich time and of France and Spain (though not
Portugal) to be 1 hour ahead of it (‘ + 1’ for short). Whereas India
and China impose a single time on their entire territory
(respectively + 5½ and + 8), other large countries have more than
one zone; the prize goes to Russia with 11, from + 2 in Kaliningrad
to + 12 in Anadyr′.

The International Date Line

An eastward-bound traveller crossing the meridian 180° east of
Greenwich needs to give back the gained day, a westward-bound
traveller to regain the lost day; ships therefore repeat the day when
eastward bound and suppress a day when westward, and air
travellers must set their calendar watches one day back in the
former case and one day forwards in the latter. When the meridian
runs through land or divides islands within a political entity, the
change is made at a suitable point to east or west; this modiﬁed
meridian is known as the International Date Line. In territories
lying west of this line, the time of day is up to 12 hours (in a few
places over 12 hours) in advance of Greenwich, in those to the east it
is behind.
13

The day

As Jules Verne explains when Phileas Fogg, who thinks he has lost
his bet to travel round the world in 80 days, is informed by
Passepartout that the day is Saturday not Sunday, by going
eastwards ‘he went ahead of the sun, and in consequence the days
diminished for him by four minutes for every degree’, making
24 hours for 360 degrees; as a result, while he saw the sun cross
the meridian 80 times, his fellow members of the Reform Club
back in London had seen it do so only 79 times. Conversely,
had he travelled westwards, he would have lost a day instead of
gaining it.

5. Time zones

Universal Time
For astronomical purposes, Greenwich Mean Time was reckoned
until 1925 by the 24-hour clock commencing at noon; since then (in
accordance with a hope expressed at the Washington conference) it
has been reckoned from midnight, on a notional prime meridian a
few metres away from the brass line. In 1928 it was renamed
Universal Time, or UT. As observed, it is known as UT0; when
corrected for the irregular movements of the terrestrial poles, or
‘Chandler wobble’, it becomes UT1. This is the astronomical and
navigational standard.

Since this takes no notice of the earth’s rotation as measured
by UT1, another standard for civil time, known as Coordinated
Universal Time, or UTC, is employed, which is kept within
0.9 seconds of UT1 by leap seconds, either positive (23.59.60
added before 00.00.00) or negative (23.59.59 omitted; no actual
case has yet occurred), at the end of June or December, at the
behest of the International Earth Rotation and Reference
Systems Service (IERS). UTC differs from TAI by an integral
number of seconds; since January 1999 UTC – TAI = −32
seconds. In the English-speaking world it is often called Greenwich
Mean Time, or GMT, although that term is also sometimes used
for UT1.
15

The day

Despite the existence of a further reﬁnement, UT2, that attempted
to correct for certain seasonal oscillations, it has proved impossible
to base a uniform timescale on terrestrial movements. Once again,
however, technology has outstripped nature: as the mechanical
clock is more regular than the sun, so the atomic clock is more
accurate than the earth. Accordingly, the second, for scientiﬁc
purposes, is now deﬁned as ‘the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles
of radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperﬁne
levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom’; time as
determined on this basis is known as TAI (Temps atomique
international).

Other measures of time are used by astronomers, such as Terrestrial
Time (TT), 32.184 seconds ahead of TAI, which is used for
calculating planetary positions in relation to the centre of the
earth; the difference between this and UT1 is known as ∆T (delta T).

The History of Time

Daylight Saving (Summer Time)
In the early 20th century, the Chelsea builder William Willett
advocated that during the spring and summer months clocks
should be put forward so that people might enjoy the early morning
light; having ﬁrst suggested four successive 20-minute advances
upon GMT, he ﬁnally settled for a single advance of one hour. The
proposal languished until 1916, when in the interests of the wartime
economy it was adopted by Germany and Austria-Hungary, the
neutral Netherlands following suit. Great Britain did likewise for
the duration of the war, and again in 1922, since when British
Summer Time, or BST, has been in force for at least part of
every year.
During the Second World War, this ‘Summer Time’ continued all
winter from 1940 till 1945; from 1941 to 1945, and again in 1947
following a fuel shortage, a two-hour advance known as Double
Summer Time was imposed for much of the year. An all-year BST,
renamed ‘British Standard Time’, was enacted in 1968; but the
persistence of darkness in the winter mornings (in northern
Scotland as late as 10 a.m.) forced a reversion to GMT in 1971. By
agreement within the European Union, Summer Time now begins
at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in March and ends at that time on
the last Sunday in October.
Most countries of the world observe daylight saving in some form,
those south of the equator in different months from those in the
north. In the United States, it runs by time zone from local 2 a.m. on
the second Sunday in March to local 2 a.m. on the second Sunday
in November; but states and US possessions may vote to exempt
themselves, or (if they straddle time zones) parts of themselves;
16

thus it is not observed in Hawaii, the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone of
Alaska, Arizona (except the Navajo Indian Reservation), or the
territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American
Samoa.

Chapter 2
Months and years

The period of the moon’s revolution round the earth is at least
notionally the month, called in most languages by a word meaning
‘moon’ or (as in English) a derivative of such a word; that of the
earth’s revolution round the sun is at least notionally the year. As
we shall see, no calendar can do proper justice to both revolutions;
either ‘month’ or ‘year’ must become an arbitrary measurement –
just as the various measures called ‘foot’ may not match the length
of any individual’s bodily foot.
In some societies, days are grouped according to a second system
running independently of months and years: the most widespread
is the seven-day week. Many such systems are market-cycles;
several such cycles of different lengths are found in Africa, but the
most familiar are the ancient Roman eight-day nundinum and the
French Revolutionary décade (see Chapter 5).
Years may be combined into centuries and millennia; longer
groupings are found in India, understood as ages of the world, and
formerly amongst the Eastern Maya, based not on the solar year or
the 260-day cycle (see Chapter 6) but on the tun of 360 days and its
multiples. The longer units have often been associated with the
lifespan of the present world, which some people had imagined
would end when the Christian era reached 2000; before that, a
similar expectation had been attached in Russia to the 7000th year
18

of the world, which in Western terms ran from 1 September 1491 to
31 August 1492.

The astronomical basis
The earth rotates on its axis; it also revolves round the sun, though
to the naı̈ve observer it is the sun that appears to revolve round the
earth, just as the moon does. When sun and moon are close
together, the moon cannot reﬂect the sun’s light; the moment at
which they have exactly the same celestial longitude is known as the
conjunction or new moon, though the latter term is also applied to
the ﬁrst visibility of the moon after it has passed the point of
conjunction. By contrast, when sun and moon face each other at
180°, we speak of opposition or full moon (Figure 6).

6. The moon’s phases
19

Months and years

The sun’s apparent revolution takes place along a path of sky known
as the zodiac, from the Greek zō´idia, ‘little animals’, because it is
divided into twelve 30° portions known as signs and called after
constellations: the Ram (Aries), the Bull (Taurus), and so on (see
Figure 7). However, these signs no longer correspond to the actual
positions of the constellations; that is due to the slow circuit of the
celestial sphere by the earth’s pole over some 25 780 years, a circuit
known as the precession of the equinoxes because it causes the

The History of Time

7. Signs of the zodiac

dynamical equinox – that intersection of ecliptic and celestial
equator at which the sun’s declination changes from south to north
– to move slowly but steadily ahead relative to the constellations
(see Figure 8). The First Point of Aries, which in the northern
hemisphere marks the vernal equinox, is thus currently situated
in the constellation Pisces, and is making its way towards
Aquarius; but great civilizations existed while it was still in
Taurus.
Most calendars are either lunar or solar. Lunar calendars are based,
in theory, on the synodic month (from the Greek súnodos,
‘conjunction’), or lunation, the period from new moon to new moon
(though Tibet and northern India count from full moon to full
moon), on average 29.530 59 days = 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes
2.976 seconds; 12 such months are grouped into a year. Solar
calendars group days into years that measure the earth’s revolution
round the sun; these are subdivided into smaller units known as
months but not governed by lunations. Most seek to match the
tropical year (from the Greek tropaí, ‘solstice’), the period of one
complete revolution of the sun’s mean longitude with respect to the
20

dynamical equinox; the current value is 365.242 19 days, or just
over 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45.2 seconds. If, however, the
intention is to mimic the period from vernal equinox to vernal
equinox, a closer average is 365.242 374 days, or just over 365 days
5 hours 49 minutes 1.1 seconds. These averages are gradually
changing; 2000 years ago they were 365.243 210 and 365.242 137
days respectively.
Owing to precession, the tropical year is somewhat shorter than the
sidereal year (from the Latin sidus, ‘constellation’), or period
between two appearances in the same position relative to the stars,
which consists of 365.256 36 days or 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes
9.5 seconds. Most sophisticated calendars have been based on the
tropical year, except in India, which has a multitude of local
21

Months and years

8. The precession of the equinoxes

calendars both solar and lunar, the former based until 1957 on the
sidereal year.
Unfortunately, 12 synodic months fall some 11 days short of a year,
whether tropical or sidereal. For this reason, no calendar can be
truly based on both; a choice has to be made. However, most lunar
calendars attempt to keep the sun in view, whereas solar calendars
pay no attention to the moon beyond the division into nominal
months.

The History of Time

Lunar calendars
The oldest method of determining the new moon is by observation
of ﬁrst visibility: the competent authorities either watch the sky
themselves or receive reports from persons deemed reliable.
Although in principle this may seem the most accurate system, so
long as the moon is considered as a visual rather than an
astronomical phenomenon, it is open both to abuse in the interest
of a faction and to interference from bad weather, which may be
limited but not abolished by a rule that if after 29 days of the
current month have elapsed the new moon is not observed on that
evening it shall be deemed to be observed on the next, so that no
month may contain more than 30 days.
Observation was also problematic in a community too large for
rapid communication, and extremely inconvenient for astronomers
who wished either to establish how many days had elapsed between
two events in the past, or to predict the date of one in the future; for
this reason, since the synodic month is a little over 29½ days long, a
reasonably accurate lunar calendar will result from an alternation
of 30-day ‘full’ and 29-day ‘hollow’ months, giving a year of
354 days; this schematic principle underlies the modern Jewish
calendar (though with numerous complications) and the theoretical
Muslim calendar used by astronomers and in conversion tables. It
has the advantage that it can be extended as far ahead (or indeed
back) as may be wished without regard to any external fact.
22

Intellectual advance offers another possibility, of calculating the
conjunction, and beginning the month either on that day (as in
China) or on the following day (as in southern India). In this way
the real moon is still taken into account, as in the observed calendar,
but relations between dates, whether past or future, can be
established as precisely as in the purely schematic calendar, though
only for so long as the calculations are deemed reliable.

Modern Westerners, to whom the Jewish and Muslim calendars are
the most familiar non-solar varieties, distinguish lunisolar
calendars with intercalation, which follow the moon but keep watch
on the sun, from lunar calendars, which admit no intercalation and
leave the sun out of account. However, the Muslim calendar, which
is of this latter description, is exceptional; not only the Jewish, but
the ancient Greek, Gaulish, Babylonian, and Chinese calendars are
lunisolar, as are the moon-based calendars of India. It makes more
sense to regard this as the predominant species of lunar calendar,
and the non-intercalating calendar as the minority species rather
than a third kind.
23

Months and years

Most lunar calendars attempt to correct the discrepancy between
lunar and solar year by the addition, every few years, of an extra
month; this is known as intercalation or embolism. It may take
place when certain external conditions are met, as in the Jewish
calendar while it was based on observation, and still does in Hindu
lunar calendars. Alternatively, a rule may be applied; one rough
method, known in antiquity and used in some early Christian
Easter tables, is to add 3 months in 8 years, but more accurate is the
addition of 8 months over a 19-year cycle. This is commonly known
as the Metonic cycle, after Meton, a Greek astronomer who
reportedly proposed it in 432 bc; however, it was ﬁrst employed by
the Babylonians, who possessed the most important lunar calendar
of antiquity (see box). It is used in the modern Jewish calendar and
(subject to certain qualiﬁcations) in the Chinese; it was also
adopted by the Christian Church for calculating Easter (see
Chapter 4).

The Babylonian calendar
The Babylonian year, which began at the ﬁrst new moon
after the spring equinox, comprised 12 months, each beginning at the ﬁrst sighting of the lunar crescent, called Nisanu,
Aiaru, Simanu, Duzu, Abu, Ululu, Tashritu, Ahrasamnu,
Kislimu, Tebetu, Shabatu, Addaru; days, which began in the
evening, were counted forwards from 1 to 30 or 29. It is
disputed at what point intercalation ceased to be ad hoc and
was subjected to a 19-year cycle, but at least by the 4th century

BC

Addaru was repeated in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 19,

and Ululu in year 17; new cycles began in 367/6 BC, 348/7 BC,

The History of Time

329/8 BC, 310/09 BC, and so on.

Within the month, the days may be numbered consecutively, as in
the Jewish and nowadays in the Muslim calendar; but this is not the
only system in existence. In several calendars the days of the waxing
and waning moons are counted separately; Hindu lunar calendars
conform to this pattern, as did (with complications) the ancient
Gaulish calendar. In other calendars of this type, the age of the
waning moon is counted backwards, so that the moon’s appearance
on any given day in the second half of the month is the mirror image
of that on the corresponding day in the ﬁrst; thus the ‘tale of days’,
or numbering system, in a full month may run as follows:

In classical Arabic, dates were sometimes given according to this
method (see Chapter 6). It is also found in medieval Europe,
where it is called the ‘custom of Bologna’ (consuetudo
Bononiensis), being favoured by that city’s notaries; in addition, it
24

is regular in lists of the two unlucky days in each month known
as Egyptian days, of which the ﬁrst is counted from the beginning
of the month and the second from the end. In most cities of
ancient Greece days were counted backwards after the 20th or
21st. Ancient Rome, as we shall see in Chapter 3, had a complex
system of marker-days and backward counting.

Solar calendars

That was the principle of the pre-Columbian calendars in
Mesoamerica and of the Zoroastrian calendar still used by the
Parsis; these are discussed in Chapter 5. It was also the principle of
the ancient Egyptian civil calendar, the most venerable calendar of
the ancient world, in which 12 months of 30 days were followed by
5 epagomenal days, known to the Egyptians as ‘days upon the
year’. Beside it there was a lunisolar ritual calendar, in which an
embolismic month was added whenever the lunar year would
otherwise have begun before the solar; in the 4th century bc an
intercalation cycle was devised with 9 embolisms in 25 years. It was
from this calendar that in the 6th century bc the months of the solar
calendar took the names by which they were known to the Greeks
and Romans.
Over all but the longest lifetime, the shortfall of the 365-day year is
barely noticeable, but after a few centuries it is quite out of step with
the seasons; it is therefore known as the annus vagus, or
25

Months and years

Although calendars exist in which the year begins when the sun
reaches a ﬁxed point in the sky (modern Iran, India since 1957)
or enters a given constellation (India before 1957), it is far
easier to work with the whole-number approximation of
365 days to the solar year. This is normally achieved by adding
ﬁve ‘epagomenal’ or additional days to a term of 360 days
divided into units conventionally known as months and
regarded as the year proper, the extra days often being deemed
unlucky.

The History of Time

‘wandering year’. Notionally the calendar began with the heliacal
rising of Sirius, whose Egyptian name sounded to the Greeks like
‘Sothis’; this heralded the beginning of the Nile ﬂood on which the
country’s life depended. In fact, however, compared with the actual
rising it began almost one day earlier every four years (see Appendix
A), or to put it another way the date on which Sirius rose was one
day later; when once more the actual New Year coincided with the
theoretical beginning, as happened on 20 July ad 139, there was
great festivity.
By the 4th century bc, Greek astronomers were aware that the
Egyptian year was too short; one of their number, Eudoxus, is said
by the elder Pliny (d. ad 79) to have devised a 4-year cycle of solar
years in which the ﬁrst year was a leap year of 366 days. The
underlying hypothesis was that the earth’s revolution took 365 days
6 hours; that is in fact a little longer than the tropical year, and a
little shorter than the sidereal year. In 238/7 bc the Macedonian
king of Egypt, Ptolemy III, ordained that a sixth epagomenal day
should be added every fourth year; the reform did not take effect,
since the Egyptian priests were not going to admit an additional
unlucky day at the behest of an alien ruler, and the Greek settlers,
who would doubtless have complied, were not yet using the
Egyptian civil year, but attempting to keep the Macedonian months
in line with the local religious calendar.
The sixth epagomenal day was imposed once more by Imperator
Caesar (soon to be given the name Augustus), when he had made
himself king of Egypt in 30 bc. The exact details are controversial,
especially since there are traces of calendrical experiment in the
ﬁrst years of his reign; but it seems that by 22 bc the reform had
taken root in Alexandria (which technically was only ‘by’ Egypt, not
part of it). In the rest of the country it took longer to be accepted;
some astronomers, indeed, preferred the old calendar for its
simplicity, since one could tell the number of days that had elapsed
between any two observations recorded by date without worrying
about leap days. However, it was the Alexandrian calendar – still
26

used by the Coptic and (with different month names) the Ethiopian
churches – on which the deﬁnitive Christian Easter reckoning
would be based before it was translated into Roman terms (see

Taken together, the 4-year leap-year cycle and the 7-day week yield
a 28-year solar cycle, after which years begin on the same day of the
week and occupy the same place in the leap-year cycle. This solar
cycle, of high importance in the Easter computus, had by the
10th century become a calendrical unit in Iceland, where the year
comprised an exact 52 weeks, or 364 days, an extra week being
added 5 times in 28 years to make up the deﬁcit (see Chapter 5).

Prehistory and history of
the modern calendar

The Roman Republican calendar
The calendar universally known and almost universally used today
is a development of the Roman calendar as reformed by Julius
Caesar in 46 bc and by Pope Gregory XIII in ad 1582. Before the
ﬁrst reform, it had been a debased lunisolar calendar with a
common year of 355 days – one too many – for the sake of the odd
number, which was thought to be more auspicious. For the same
reason, there were no 30-day months as in normal lunar calendars;
February had 28 days, but all the others an odd number, either 31
or 29.
Six of the months were named after the numbers 5–10, counting
from March; but although there was a tradition that this had
once been the beginning of the year and February the end (to
which its shortness and its puriﬁcatory rituals gave support), in
historical times the ﬁrst month was January, named after Janus,
the god of gateways who faced both backwards and forwards and
who was named ﬁrst in public prayers. The Romans themselves
were aware of the contradiction, but found no more convincing
answer than that King Romulus, the mythical founder of Rome,
a soldier and a statesman but no intellectual, had not bothered
to subdivide the bleak winter period between December and
March.
28

Every day in the calendar was labelled with a letter from A to H,
indicating its place in an eight-day market-cycle known by inclusive
reckoning as the nundinum, or ‘nine-day period’; once one knew
the date of any market, the letter standing beside it would indicate
all the other markets in the year. Other markings indicated whether
the citizen assembly could meet, or the praetor hear lawsuits, on the
given day; certain religious celebrations were also recorded, in
accordance with tradition rather than current importance (see, for
example, Figure 9).
In order to keep in line with the seasons, the body of priests
known as the pontiﬁces from time to time ordered the insertion of
an extra 27-day month known as Interkalaris or Interkalarius, with
Nones on the 5th and Ides on the 13th, either after 23 February
(the Terminalia) or one day later; the remaining days of February
were suppressed, so that the year contained 378 or 377 days. The
29

Prehistory and history of the modern calendar

Other cultures in Italy marked the beginnings of months and their
mid-points at full moon; the Romans called these respectively
Kalendae (‘Kalends’), from an ancient verb calare, because the new
moon had originally been announced on that day, and Eidus
(‘Ides’), from an Etruscan word meaning ‘divide’, which in the four
31-day months (March, May, Quinctilis, and October) fell on the
15th, in the rest on the 13th. But they also had a third marker-day,
the Nonae (‘Nones’), on the 7th of the 31-day months and the 5th
of the rest, 8 days before the Ides as we should say, but as the
Romans said the 9th day (nonus = 9th), since they preferred to
count inclusively. (Christians still say that Christ rose on the
3rd day, counting Friday, Saturday, Sunday; compare the French
demain en huit ‘tomorrow week’.) All other days were named in
relation to the next marker-day: the day before was called pridie
Kalendas/Nonas/Eidus, the others ‘the nth day before’, once again
counted inclusively, so that the day after the Kalends was the 6th
before the Nones (ante diem sextum Nonas, abbreviated a.d. VI
Non.) in the 31-day months, the 4th before them in the others, and
so on.

nundinal cycle was interrupted at K. Interk., but thereafter ran
smoothly till the end of the year.

This was all the more convenient because the Romans regularly
dated by the consuls; thus Julius Caesar was born ‘on the fourth day
before the Quinctilis Ides when Gaius Marius, for the sixth time,
and Lucius Valerius Flaccus were consuls’. The conventional
translation is 12 July 100 bc, though whether it was also 12 July in
the retrojected Julian calendar (see below) we do not know.

The Julian reform
In 63 bc Caesar, at that point an ambitious young politician and not
a military conqueror, was elected pontifex maximus, thus becoming
responsible for intercalation; during the Gallic War it took place
only in those years in which he could spend February away from
Gaul, in 55 and 52 bc, and not at all in the ensuing Civil War. As a
result, the calendar once more ran ahead of the sun, until Caesar,
having defeated his implacable enemies, was free in 46 bc to take
decisive action. Ordering not only a normal intercalation, but the
31

Prehistory and history of the modern calendar

Intercalation was not ordered on scientiﬁc principles, but as
political or other considerations might suggest (the pontiﬁces were
themselves politicians); sometimes the decision was taken so late
that Cicero had to date his letters by days before Terminalia. The
widespread superstition that extra days are unlucky caused the
process to be suspended during the Second Punic War, so that the
calendar raced some four months ahead of the sun; the solar eclipse
of 14 March 190 bc was recorded on 11 July. When the pontiﬁces
resumed intercalation, they overcompensated to such an extent that
when in 153 bc a military emergency compelled the new chief
ofﬁcers of state, or consuls, to enter ofﬁce at once and embark on a
spring campaign, they took over not on 15 March, as had been the
norm since 222 bc, but on 1 January. Since that date was also the
New Year, it was retained for the start of the consuls’ term ever
afterwards.

insertion between November and December of two long months,
together comprising 67 days, he extended that year – the last year of
the confusion, as a late Roman writer calls it – to 445 days in order
to make up for the missed intercalations of wartime.

The History of Time

From 45 bc onwards the new calendar was to be in force: the four
31-day months were unchanged, but the 29-day months were
extended by either one extra day (April, June, September,
November) or two (January, Sextilis, December), thus giving the
year 365 days instead of 355. The position of Nones and Ides in
these months was not affected; instead, the day after the Ides
became the 18th or 19th before the Kalends instead of the 17th.
There was no further need of the intercalary month; but in order to
keep the year in line with the seasons, a leap year was instituted in
which 24 February was counted twice over. The extra day was
known as ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias, the twice-sixth
day before the March Kalends; from this comes the formal English
term ‘bissextile year’ and the normal French année bissextile for
‘leap year’.
Caesar decreed that the extra day should be inserted quarto quoque
anno, meaning ‘every fourth year’, but since most Romans
understood the phrase as ‘every third year’, after his murder a threeyear cycle was instituted until Augustus, having himself become
pontifex maximus in 12 bc, corrected the error by omitting
intercalation after 9 bc (a leap year in both the correct and the
faulty cycle), to be resumed in ad 8 and every four years
thereafter. Since ad 8 was 52 years after 45 bc, this too must have
been a leap year like the ﬁrst year of Eudoxus’ 4-year cycle, exactly
as is presupposed in modern bc reckoning, which uses Caesar’s
calendar indeﬁnitely retrojected. The ﬁrst day of the Julian calendar
was therefore the day we call 1 January 45 bc. That was a Friday, the
day of Venus, governed by a beneﬁcent planet from whose goddess
Caesar’s family claimed descent. (An alternative theory, that the
calendar began on the 2nd with a common year, not only requires
32

Augustus to have made a mistake but overlooks the bad luck
attaching to Saturday. Caesar’s sense of public relations was far too
good for that.)

Although the Greek cities of the empire had their own calendars,
the Roman calendar was also used as the empire-wide system of
time-reckoning; but by the 5th century Greek-speakers had found
the system of marker-days too cumbersome, and adopted the
forward count from 1st to 31st, or whatever the last day was. This
was much slower to be established in the Latin world, despite its use
by Pope Gregory I (590–604); but it became the norm in the
vernacular languages. In consequence, leap day was moved to
29 February (see box).

From Caesar to Gregory XIII
Caesar’s reform presupposed a solar year of 365 days 6 hours, which
is just over 11 minutes too long compared with the tropical year; the
discrepancy amounts to 1 day in just over 128 years. From vernal
equinox to vernal equinox it is less, 1 day in just over 131 years.
It was the vernal equinox by which the Christian churches deﬁned
Easter (see Chapter 4). The conventional Roman date, 25 March
(established after the reform but derived from earlier Greek
33

Prehistory and history of the modern calendar

In 44 bc the month of Caesar’s birth, Quinctilis, was renamed Iulius
to honour the deiﬁed dictator; in 8 bc, at the time of the correction,
Sextilis, in which his heir had defeated the combined forces of
Antony and Cleopatra, was renamed Augustus. Thereafter the
calendar, despite a few linguistic changes such as sexto Idus, or later
Iduum, for ante diem sextum Idus (the spelling Eidus had been
given up), and the occasional but never permanent renaming of
months after subsequent emperors, continued without further
structural disturbance till 1582; neither the replacement of the
nundinum by the week, nor successive changes in pagan and
Christian feast days, affected the length and order of the months.

Leap day
• Legally the additional day, a.d. bis VI K. Mart., in Caesar’s
calendar fell on what we should call 25 February, following
the normal a.d. VI K. Mart. on the 24th; however,
unofﬁcial usage reversed the order. This latter became the
majority practice of the Western Church outside Norway
and Iceland; it entailed postponing St Matthias’ day in leap
year from 24 February to the 25th, as is still the rule in
the Roman Catholic Church. In the Church of England,
however, postponement was given up in 1684, owing to an
error by the then Archbishop of Canterbury that for

The History of Time

political reasons was never put right.
• When dates are counted forward, without reference to the
Roman marker-days, leap day is the 29th; that is the usage
not merely of the civil calendar, but also of the Orthodox
Church, in which 29 February is St Cassian’s day.

astronomers, since it ﬁts the 3rd century bc not the 1st), fell further
and further behind the real equinox; in the 3rd century ad the true
date was generally the 21st, which was adopted by the Alexandrian
church in calculations that were to become deﬁnitive for all
Christians, but in its turn became ever more obviously false.
From the 13th century onwards, when the discrepancy exceeded a
week, proposals for reform were made, based on the principle that a
certain number of days should be omitted as a one-off correction
and thereafter intercalations should from time to time be
suppressed, so as to reduce the excessive number of leap years.
However, as we shall see in the next chapter, that would not have
sufﬁced to correct the date on which Easter fell; on the one hand, it
34

was the discrepancy between nominal and real equinox that gave
the reformers their chief motive, on the other it was the change in
Easter reckoning that generated the most hostility to their work.

The Christian princes did nothing, and neither did the Council of
Trent, which sat from 1545 to 1563 to consider reforms in the
Roman Church. Indirectly, however, its ﬁnal session reopened the
question, by referring revision of the missal and the breviary – the
Church’s service-books – to the Pope. Although these revisions were
duly executed by Pius V (whose breviary of 1568 included a botched
revision of the Paschal lunar calendar), his successor Gregory XIII
extrapolated a general power to reform the calendar on which the
books were based; in 1578 he instituted a process that culminated
four years later in the promulgation of the calendar that still bears
his name.
In order that the equinox, currently on or about 11 March, should
once again fall on the 21st, the Pope ordered that the day after
4 October 1582 should be called the 15th; further slippage was to
be prevented by suppressing the leap day in centennial years (those
ending in 00) unless exactly divisible by 400. That was not the most
35

Prehistory and history of the modern calendar

In 1476 the great astronomer Johannes Müller, commonly known
as Regiomontanus because he came from Königsberg in Bavaria,
was summoned to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV for the purpose of
reform, only to die soon after his arrival. Some forty years later Pope
Leo X referred the question to the universities, which made no
recommendation. Any hope of resolving the issue was dashed by the
outbreak of the Reformation; a movement so hostile to clerical
jurisdiction could not allow that popes had the right to reform a
calendar laid down by Caesar, let alone for the sake of a feast not
laid down by Scripture. Luther asserted that reform was the
business not of the Church, but of the Christian princes; however, to
avoid confusion, not least in the dates of fairs, they should act
together or not at all. The advice was particularly pertinent for
Germany, divided as it was into many states.

accurate correction, but it was the most convenient, being far easier
to keep track of than alternative cycles; it also had the advantage
that 1600 would still be a leap year, and the ﬁrst suppression safely
distant in 1700. This part of the reform is commonly known as the
New Style.

The History of Time

Acceptance and rejection of the New Style
When Pope Gregory promulgated his Bull, not only was papal
authority denied by Protestants, but opinion even in Roman
Catholic countries laid a new emphasis on the rights of the civil
power. Outside the Papal States it was the secular authorities that
enacted the reform; the Italian cities and Spain were prompt to
comply – so that St Teresa of Ávila died on 4 October 1582 and was
buried on the 15th – but in France, where papal interference was
widely resented, Henri III’s desire to conform on the due date was
thwarted (to the Pope’s annoyance) by ﬁerce opposition in the
Parlement; not till December was the change made, when the 9th
(marked by a solemn procession, led by the King, to pray for a royal
heir) was followed immediately by the 20th. In some countries
implementation took even longer.
The new calendar was much disliked both as being a change to
age-old custom and as upsetting the traditional farmer’s year and
weather proverbs; worst of all, says a satirical German song, the
Pope had interfered with St Urban’s day (25 May), which was a
predictor for the wine-harvest. If it was ﬁne, meaning that the
grapes would be plentiful, the peasants drank their ﬁll of wine and
poured some on the saint’s statue; if it was wet, portending a poor
harvest, they rolled his statue in the mire, or threw it into the river.
The choice was between applying such observances ten calendar
days later, or abandoning them altogether.
With the exception of two Dutch provinces, Holland (which omitted
16–24 December 1582) and Zeeland (which omitted 2–11 January
1583), the whole non-Catholic world retained the Julian calendar.
36

The Orthodox (and English high-churchmen) declared that the
calendar of the ‘318 Holy Fathers at Nicaea’ could not be altered
except by an Oecumenical Council; Protestants who cared nothing
for Nicaea objected that the equinox ought (as many Roman
Catholics had expected) to have been made 25 March as in Caesar’s
day, and that the lunar tables were not perfectly accurate, but at
bottom these were pretexts for refusing the work of the Pope. Even
under Roman Catholic rule, the Greek possessions of Venice
retained the Julian calendar, as did the Orthodox (and ‘Uniats’) of
the Polish Commonwealth.

The new calendar made a little headway in the early 17th century,
being accepted for example by the Duchy of Prussia and the Swiss
canton of Wallis, but most Protestants were still using the Julian
calendar as 1700 drew near, bringing with it an increase in the
discrepancy from 10 to 11 days. This prospect induced the Dutch,
German, Danish, and most Swiss Protestants to adopt the New
Style (though not the Gregorian Easter; see Chapter 4). Sweden
attempted to introduce it painlessly, by suppressing the 11 leap days
from 1700 to 1740. That of 1700 was duly omitted, but not those of
1704 and 1708; as a result the decisive military defeat by Russia at
Poltava, dated by British and Russian historians to 27 June 1709
Old Style, in most other countries on 8 July New Style, took place on
37

Prehistory and history of the modern calendar

In England, Elizabeth I was intelligent enough to perceive the merits
of reform and wise enough to take advice; her ministers were in
favour, but her bishops would have none of it. The foremost
mathematician and magus of the time, John Dee, calculating that
11 days and 53 minutes had crept in since Christ’s birth, argued for
omitting the last day of every month from January to September
1583 and the last two of October, so that England might set an
example for the rest of Christendom, and even the Pope, to follow.
This was the ﬁrst of several schemes for English calendrical
exceptionalism, and far sounder than the 592-year cycle propounded
in 1621 by Thomas Lydiat on the basis of the Jewish rather than
the Roman calendar, which won some fame but no following.

The History of Time

28 June Swedish style. Fear that this disaster was due to divine
displeasure at interference with the calendar caused the Julian
reckoning to be restored in 1712 by the addition of a 30th day to
February.
A proposal to reform the English calendar had come to naught,
not least at the anti-Popish urging of the mathematician John
Wallis, who observed, amongst much else, that Easter could be
found astronomically without changing the civil year – the very
plan Sweden would adopt in 1740 – and that Scotland, still a
separate kingdom, might not conform; since the Kirk refused to
celebrate Easter as being unscriptural, it had no reason to care
about the equinox. But once the need to persuade two Parliaments
had been removed by the Union of 1707, several proposals were
made for calendar reform, some quite radical, and advanced
without regard to such practicalities as relations with the
Continent.
The only sensible reform, adoption of the New Style, was eventually
implemented by an Act of Parliament in 1751, which decreed the
omission of the 11 days from 3 to 13 September 1752 (see Figure
10), and also switched the beginning of the English year from
25 March to 1 January as in Scotland and most other countries
(see box, p. 40).
The Act distinguished between events such as Church festivals to
be held on the ‘nominal day’ and those such as agricultural fairs,
the determination of leases, or coming of age, postponed till the
‘natural day’: thus Michaelmas 1752 was to be 29 September New
Style, but a Michaelmas fair would be held on 10 October. Several
anomalies emerged, requiring additional legislation: at Chester, for
example, where on the Friday after St Dennis’s day (9 October) the
mayoral ceremony was accompanied by a fair, the Act of 1751
required the former to take place 11 days before the latter. An
amendment was hurriedly inserted into a bill on distemper in
cattle.

Late in 1752, a spectacularly uninhibited election campaign began
for the two Oxfordshire seats, not contested since 1710, even though
the poll would not be held till 1754. One of the ‘New Interest’
candidates (pro-government Whigs) challenging the established
‘Old Interest’ (oppositional Tories) was Lord Parker, the son of the
Act’s architect the Earl of Macclesﬁeld. This made the calendar an
issue in the early months of 1753; thereafter interest fell away, but
the Oxfordshire excesses helped inspire Hogarth’s satirical
paintings of The Election. The ﬁrst of these, An Election
Entertainment (Figure 11), features a forlorn and trampled placard
reading ‘Give us our eleven days’, which has given rise to the myth
that there were riots against the New Style; riots indeed there were,
but against the naturalization of Jews, which the government had
just enacted and was intimidated into repealing.
In 1753 Sweden ﬁnally adopted the New Style, by omitting
18–28 February; the Protestants of the highly decentralized
Grischun or Graubünden (not part of Switzerland till 1803) began

to fall into line in 1784, though the commune of Susch (in German
Süs) had to be coerced by Napoleonic troops in 1811. From then on,
the New Style was universal amongst Protestants as well as Roman
Catholics.

The History of Time

Not till the 20th century did any Orthodox country accept the
reform even for civil purposes; but the suppression in Bulgaria of
1–13 April 1916, followed by similar state action in Soviet Russia,
Serbia, and Greece, provoked reconsideration. In May 1923 some
churches agreed on a ‘Revised Julian Calendar’, comprising three
reforms:
(i) the ﬁrst 13 days of October 1923 should be omitted;
(ii) the only centennial leap years should be those that, when divided
by 900, left a remainder of 200 or 600 (a far more accurate rule
than the Gregorian);
(iii) the full moon on which the date of Easter depended should be
determined not by the traditional rules (see Chapter 4), but
according to the meridian of Jerusalem.

This last reform failed; of the other two, the ﬁrst did not take place
on time, and in many places has still not done so. Under state
pressure, the Greek church – though not the self-governing
communities on Mount Athos – accepted the reform from
10/23 March 1924; later that year state and church embraced it in
Romania, but the Bulgarian church did not change till 1968, and
the Russian, Serbian, Macedonian, and Georgian churches, along
with the Orthodox in Jerusalem and Poland, still use the Julian
calendar for the immovable feasts even though the civil dates are
13 days later. Christmas, which is celebrated in Greece on the same
day as in the West, falls in these countries on 7 January; it thus
follows the civil New Year, which as a non-religious festival was
much promoted in the USSR to overshadow it.
The second reform (which some Westerners have wrongly credited
to the Soviet regime) has met with widespread acceptance on paper;
42

but since 2000 was, and 2400 will be, a leap year in both calendars,
not till 2800, a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not the
Revised Julian, will it be known whether the new rule has been put
into practice.

Chapter 4
Easter

Easter, commemorating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is
historically the most important of all Christian festivals, even
though in some Western countries it has largely lost the religious
signiﬁcance it retains amongst the Orthodox; nevertheless it merits
discussion in a broader context not only because it is often a public
as well as a religious holiday, or indeed because even Christians
may be bafﬂed by its apparently capricious incidence, but because
the history of its calculation illustrates many complexities of
time-reckoning.
The origin of Easter is the Jewish Passover, known in Hebrew as
pesah but in Aramaic, the normal spoken language of Jews in
˙
Roman Palestine, as pashā, which in Greek became páscha. (From
˙
this comes our adjective ‘Paschal’; the name ‘Easter’ is transferred
from a Germanic festival.) Passover, in biblical times, was the
slaughter of the Paschal lamb on 14 Nisan; it was eaten at nightfall,
the beginning of the 15th by Jewish reckoning, and therefore of the
seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread.
According to St John’s Gospel, the Cruciﬁxion took place in the
daytime of 14 Nisan; this date seems more plausible than the 15th
offered by the other three gospels, since that day would have been
profaned by the proceedings. It was therefore natural for early
Christians, many of them still Jews, to commemorate the
44

Cruciﬁxion on 14 Nisan, making Jesus the Lamb of God sacriﬁced
to redeem humanity; the association was all the easier because in
Greek páscha suggested the verb páschein, ‘to suffer’. Even after
Christianity had become a largely Gentile religion, the practice
continued in Asia Minor, where the authority of St John was
claimed for it, long after most other Christians had abandoned it.
Such persistence was eventually classed as a heresy, known as
Quartodecimanism.

Easter limits
From the 3rd century onwards, most churches agreed that Easter
should be the Sunday after luna XIV; but that was only the
beginning. Two questions of principle remained: when the ﬁrst
lunar month began, and whether, should luna XIV be a Sunday, to
observe Easter on that day or the following Sunday in order to keep
apart from the Jews, who had not yet adopted a rule by which
14 Nisan could never be a Sunday. The latter became the more
widespread practice; at Rome the conception of 14 Nisan as the ﬁrst
Good Friday caused Easter to be postponed even when luna XIV fell
on Saturday, so that the feast was never earlier than the 16th lune or
day of the lunar month (luna XVI), on which the Resurrection had
45

Easter

However, since Jesus had risen on Sunday, that day was observed as
a weekly feast day; in time it became normal, rather than to keep
the anniversary of the Cruciﬁxion, to celebrate that of the
Resurrection, in the eastern provinces on the Sunday after Passover,
elsewhere on the Sunday after a date found by independent
calculation, both to avoid dependence on the Jews and because the
increasingly widespread custom of fasting before it required
knowing the date in advance. This entailed ﬁnding the 14th day of
the ﬁrst lunar month, called simply tessareskaidekátē, ‘fourteenth’,
in Greek, but in Latin luna quartadecima, literally the ‘fourteenth
moon’, abbreviated below as luna XIV. Once luna XIV had been
found, the next Sunday had to be identiﬁed. The method of making
these calculations is known as computus.

The History of Time

taken place, and might be as late as the 22nd (luna XXII). On the
other hand, it was essential that it should not fall after 21 April, the
day of the Parilia, celebrating Romulus’ foundation of the City,
lest Christians, forced to fast on a civic feast, should be subject
to hostility or temptation. Both the lunar limit of the 16th to
22nd lunes, and the lower solar limit of 21 April, are found in a
calendar with base-year 222 inscribed in Greek on a stone chair
now standing at the foot of the stairs in the Vatican Library.
In this calendar Easter may fall as early as 18 March; but Christians
began to complain that Jews were no longer following their own
rule that Passover should not precede the vernal equinox. This
allegation was due partly to a misunderstanding of the Jewish rules,
but partly to demonstrable variety in practice between one Jewish
community and another (see Chapter 6). But if the Jewish Pascha
ought not to precede the vernal equinox, it followed that the
Christian Pascha ought not to do so either; by the 4th century the
Church at Rome, where the date of the equinox was still taken to be
25 March, seems to have taken that view, though it could not be
sustained in practice. At Alexandria the more rigorous principle
was adopted that luna XIV itself, the proper date of Passover, must
not precede the equinox, which was (more accurately) equated with
25 Phamenoth = 21 March; on the other hand, there was no lower
limit, since 21 April (locally 26 Pharmouthi) was of no signiﬁcance.

Early Easter cycles
There was also diversity, though not based on religious principle, in
the methods used for ﬁnding luna XIV; many of them fell far short
of the scientiﬁc standards already achieved by astronomy, suspect
for its connection with astrology. The earliest method was the
octaeteris or 8-year cycle, in which the lunar months were
alternatively of 30 and 29 days, the civil leap day was counted as a
lune in its own right, and an embolismic 30-day month was added
in years 3, 6, and 8. This meant that 8 civil years exactly matched
8 lunar years, comprising 2922 days. The calendar on the Vatican
46

chair was calculated ahead on this principle for 112 years.
Unfortunately, since 99 actual lunations take not 2922 but just over
2923½ days, the table was soon found to be inaccurate; it was
revised by a Latin writer, with new dates but on the same ﬂawed
principle, to run from 243.

The Alexandrian solution
At Alexandria the old 8-year cycle had long been banished in favour
of the Metonic cycle of 19 years with 7 embolisms; although the
precise course of development is uncertain, by 323 at the latest the
computus had reached its ﬁnal form (see Appendix B). It was based
on a pseudo-Jewish calendar in which luna XIV ranged between
the equinox on 25 Phamenoth (21 March) and 23 Pharmouthi
(18 April), since celebration on that day was forbidden but not on
the next, the earliest possible date for Easter was 26 Phamenoth
(22 March), the latest 30 Pharmouthi (25 April).
In contrast to the Supputatio Romana, the Alexandrian cycle
provided one and only one legitimate Easter each year; but since,
unlike the 84-year table, it was not commensurate with the week,
47

Easter

Less inaccurate were 84-year tables, which had the advantage of
comprising an exact number of weeks, so that each cycle began on
the same feria as its predecessor. In the course of a cycle there were
31 embolisms, made whenever the epact or lunar age on 1 January
exceeded 19; the leap day was not counted as a separate lune, and
six lunes were omitted in order to keep lunar and solar cycle in
order. This omission was called saltus lunae, ‘the moon’s leap’, since
the epact leapt over the intervening value, for example from 20 to
22; it took place either every 14 years, as in the table drawn up by
one Augustalis, apparently in 3rd-century Africa (which permitted
celebration on luna XIV and allowed Easter to fall on 16 March), or
every 12 years up to year 72, as in the 4th-century Supputatio
Romana, a shoddy piece of work that in some years gave two
legitimate Easters, in others none.

The History of Time

once the date of luna XIV had been determined it was necessary
each time to ﬁnd the next Sunday. This was done by calculating a
variable known as the ‘days of the gods’, a pagan and astrological
name that the Alexandrian church saw no need to change. Although
Easter dates usually repeated at 95-year intervals, they did so fully
only after 532 years.
It was the custom for the Patriarch of Alexandria to send out a
circular letter every year announcing the date of Easter and making
such comment on Church affairs as the times might demand. By the
middle of the 4th century Patriarchs were claiming that the Council
of Nicaea, called in 325 to discuss a troublesome heresy, had
entrusted them with determining the date of Easter for Christians
at large. This was not true, though immediately afterwards the
Emperor Constantine had decreed that Christians must not
‘celebrate with the Jews’, that is be governed by the date of Passover;
nevertheless, the Alexandrians gained increasing credence. By
360 the church in Milan was taking its Easter from Alexandria not
Rome; in the early 5th century even Rome generally followed the
Alexandrian date, provided this was no later than 21 April.
By the mid-6th century, Constantinople, which used a slightly
different Metonic cycle, had adjusted the position of the saltus to
yield the same Easter dates as the Alexandrian in all cases. The
Armenian and both main Syriac-speaking churches accepted only
part of the reform, so that in 4 years out of 532 they kept Easter on
13 April (Julian), while Constantinople kept the 6th. The ﬁrst year
of divergence was 570, the last 1824; the case is next due to arise in
2071. On occasions, the Greek and Armenian communities in
Jerusalem have come to blows over the discrepancy.

Victorius and Dionysius
The Roman solar limit of 21 April was breached in 444, when Pope
Leo I was persuaded to observe the 23rd, and in 455, with the
greatest reluctance, the 24th; in consequence, the leading
48

mathematician of the Latin-speaking world, Victorius of Aquitaine,
was commissioned to draw up new Easter tables for papal use. His
tables, extending over 532 years, purported to follow Alexandrian
principles, discarding altogether the Roman 84-year cycle and solar
limits; but he placed the saltus in the 6th year of the cycle instead of
the 19th, let luna XIV range between 20 March and 17 April, gave
different ‘Latin’ and ‘Greek’ dates when it fell on a Saturday, and
refused to countenance Easter on 25 April.
The result was a mess: for 482 he gave a Latin date of 18 April on
luna XV and a Greek date of 24 April (a Saturday!) on luna XXII,
both lunes impossible for their respective churches. These tables
would later attract scornful comment from all sides; nevertheless,
they were widely used in the Latin-speaking world, because they
appeared to give Easter dates for all time, and also retained the
familiar reference to the epact and feria of 1 January.

Dionysius’ tables (see Figure 12) present ﬁve 19-year cycles, each set
out in eight columns: years ad, indictions (see Chapter 6), epacts,
concurrent days, lunar cycle, luna XIV, Easter, lune of Easter. Of
these the last three are self-explanatory; the lunar cycle is that of
Constantinople (three years behind the Alexandrian), added purely
for comparison. The epacts are those of Alexandria, the concurrent
days correspond to the ‘days of the gods’; but neither term is
explained, so that later users were obliged to work out the meaning
49

Easter

At Rome, however, some dissatisfaction appears to have remained,
for Victorius had abandoned Roman tradition without achieving
unity with Alexandria or Constantinople. In 501, when Rome and
Constantinople were in schism, Pope Symmachus celebrated on
25 March, according to the Supputatio Romana, and not the
Alexandrian and Victorian date of 22 April; in 525, when the rift
had been healed, the monk Dionysius Exiguus, invited to draw
up a new table, made the ﬁnal breach with Roman tradition by
simply continuing the Alexandrian tables for a further 95 years
from 532 to 626.

for themselves. Indeed, it is not apparent that Dionysius himself
knew what they were: he could extrapolate their values easily
enough, and as a practical man probably looked no further. As
might be expected from one whose other main achievement, a
compilation of church law, required learning and diligence rather
than insight, his tables are accurate, his expositions defective.
Despite being commissioned, Dionysius’ tables took over a century
to oust Victorius’ at Rome, and even longer elsewhere. Victorius’
50

tables were perpetual, followed the traditional form, and appeared
to be comprehensible (it was on close examination that the ﬂaws
appeared); Dionysius’ would need recalculating after 95 years,
ignored 1 January, and were difﬁcult to understand. By Isidore of
Seville’s time, in the early 7th century, it had been discovered
empirically that the epact corresponded to the lune of 22 March; in
the early 8th century the Venerable Bede observed that the
concurrent days (or, as we usually say in English, the ‘concurrent’)
matched the feria of 24 March. Ever afterwards these explanations
have been standard in Western writing, and all too often are
supposed to be Alexandrian.

Insular Easter

The upper solar limit was the day after the Latin equinox; the other
limits were taken from Augustalis. The novelty was the lunar
calendar, which abandoned the alternation of full and hollow
months: the full month ending in January was followed by three
successive hollow months; the remaining lunar months each
contained one day fewer than the solar months in which they
ended. A careful choice of initial epact ensured that, like the
Alexandrian computus, and unlike either Augustalis or the
Supputatio Romana, the Latercus gave a single Easter date for
every year.
When at the end of the 6th century St Colmán, or Columbanus, of
Bangor (Co. Down) left Ireland for Gaul, his Latercus offended the
51

Easter

In the British Isles, Easter was calculated on entirely different
principles, from a table known by an irregularly formed Latin word
as the Latercus and attributed to Sulpicius Severus in the
mid-4th century. It was based on an 84-year cycle with saltus at
14-year intervals; the solar limits were 26 March for the earliest
Easter and 23 April for the last, the lunar limits lunae XIV to XX,
so that when luna XIV fell on a Sunday, that was Easter. When the
rest of Christendom found out, it was scandalized.

The History of Time

local churches, which were committed to Victorius. In a letter
to Pope Gregory the Great that veils insolence in humility,
Columbanus defends his practice, declaring that the learned among
his countrymen had rejected Victorius’ tables as worthy rather of
pity than of scorn (a judgement more charitable than those of
Dionysius and Bede); that celebration on luna XXI, let alone XXII,
is improper since the moon ought not to rise later than midnight on
a feast celebrating the triumph of light over darkness; and that
celebration on the same day as the Jews is no problem because
Pascha belongs not to them but to the Lord (Exod. 12: 11).
Meanwhile, the papal mission to England introduced Roman
practice into southern England, and came into conﬂict over this and
other matters with the Britons; during the 7th century both
Victorius’ and Dionysius’ tables made some headway in Ireland,
above all in the south (though memory of the Latercus epacts
survived in West Cork till the mid-19th century), but the monastery
of Iona, founded by Colm Cille (St Columba), and those associated
with it, remained steadfast for the Latercus, which missionaries
brought thence to Northumbria.
The difference between the two practices caused difﬁculties in the
Northumbrian court, where the Irish-educated King Oswy had
married the Kentish princess Eanﬂæd, brought up in the Roman
tradition; Bede reports that sometimes the King would be
celebrating Easter while the Queen was still observing Palm
Sunday. Until the details of the Latercus were known, this was
thought to be an occasional event, due to his keeping luna XIV; in
fact, it happened in at least half the years of their marriage before
the question was resolved, but never for that reason. The
discrepancies were mostly due to the differences between their
lunar calendars, sometimes to those between their solar limits; in
no year was the same day luna XIV for both, whether on Sunday or
any other feria (see box).
By 664 King Oswy, and the clergy of his realm, had had enough. A

synod was summoned at Whitby to determine whether Celtic or
Roman tradition should be followed, both in Easter computus and
in clerical tonsure; for whereas the Romans shaved the crown of the
head, the Celts shaved everything from forehead to ears.
The Celtic cause was argued by Bishop Colmán of Lindisfarne, the
Roman by Wilfrid, later Bishop of York, who dominated the debate,
bullying poor Colmán, insulting St Columba, misrepresenting facts,
but clinching the argument with fantastic assertions about the
practice of St Peter. King Oswy opted for Rome, giving as ground
that it was St Peter, not St Columba, who held the keys of heaven.
Gradually the rest of the British Isles fell in line with Rome; the last
to conform were the Welsh, some of whom still held out in the 840s.

The History of Time

Although the struggle was described as being between the 19-year
cycle (Victorian or Dionysian) and the 84-year cycle of the Celts,
the mode of calculation was a detail; it was the difference in
limits that raised questions of religion. The rivalry between the
two versions of the 19-year cycle remained on the technical level;
the decisive blow was struck by Bede in his De temporum ratione
of 725, which did for Dionysius what Dionysius had failed to do
(and Victorius had done for his own system) by setting out a
complete exposition of his Easter principles together with a
532-year Easter table that did away with the need for recalculation
every 95 years (see Figure 13). Within a century, Bede’s table was
in use throughout the West, even in Gaul, where Victorius died
hard.

The lunar calendar
Although the Alexandrian Easter computus, like others, is based
on a lunar calendar, the Alexandrians were not particularly
concerned to know the lune of every day; in the West, by
contrast, such knowledge was deemed so important that in
monasteries the lune of the day would be announced along with
its martyrs at prime. This entailed recalculating the new moons:
it was not enough to convert Alexandrian dates into Julian, for
though in both Alexandrian and Western practice the odd
months of the lunar year were full and the even hollow, their
incidence differed.
In Alexandria, the full months normally began in the oddnumbered solar months, but in the West, where the lunar month
was identiﬁed with the solar month in which it ended, they
normally began in the even-numbered months and ﬁnished in the
odd. This was expressed by the versiﬁed rule impar luna pari, par
ﬁet in impare mense, as it were ‘odd moon in even month, even
in odd’. That is to say, the moon has an odd number of days (29)
in an even-numbered month, an even number of days (30) in an
odd-numbered month.

show 1st and 8th indictions from 538 and 545 onwards, and every 28th

year in the previous Paschal cycle, from 18 to 531. The surrounding rows
and columns give other miscellaneous information.
55

The History of Time

Since in the 7th century the leading experts on the computus were
the Irish (from whose writings Bede learnt much, though he never
says so), it is not surprising to ﬁnd a treatise entitled De ratione
conputandi that sets out a complete lunar calendar for the year
on Dionysiac principles. However, though much of this text was to
be copied into a book owned three hundred years later by
St Dunstan, it was Bede’s rather different system that became
deﬁnitive. By careful placement of his embolisms he ensured that
only in three years was the regular sequence of monthly epacts
disrupted, and only in those years were some lunar months
named after the solar months in which they began. Thereafter,
when men as learned and ingenious as Hrabanus Maurus
(c. 780–856) and Abbo of Fleury (c. 945–1004) produced new
methods of calculating the same results, it was Bede whom they
were reﬁning.
In Bede’s time, the lune of the day was found by adding to the
epact (see box) parameters known as ‘lunar regulars’ to obtain
the moon’s age on the 1st of each month: thus for epact 11, the
lune of 1 March was 11 + 9 = 20, of 1 April 11 + 10 = 21. From the
12th century, however, it was found directly from the so-called
Golden Number, written in calendars against the dates of the
new moons in the corresponding year of the 19-year cycle;
similarly Bede’s method of ﬁnding feriae from the concurrent
with the aid of ‘solar regulars’ (for example, if the concurrent
was 2, then the feria of 1 March was 2 + 5 = 7, of 1 April 2 + 1 = 3)
was replaced in the later Middle Ages by the Sunday Letter
(see Chapter 5).

The need for reform
However well Bede had done his work, he could not cure the basic
faults of the solar and lunar calendars, namely that neither was
accurate enough. By the 13th century, the solar calendar was far
enough behind the sun for reforms to be proposed. This was no
longer a task for an intelligent heir of Caesar and Augustus: in a
56

Epacts, Golden Numbers, concurrents
To ﬁnd the Julian epact, divide the year

AD

by 19; if the

remainder is 0, that is the epact, otherwise multiply it by 11,
divide by 30, and the new remainder is the epact.
To ﬁnd the Golden (i.e. important) Number, also called the
prime (from luna prima), add 1 to the year, divide by 19, and
take the remainder; if this is 0, the Golden Number is 19.
To ﬁnd the concurrent (used only in the Julian calendar), add
to the year AD its fourth part (ignoring fractions) and the parameter 4, divide by 7, and take the remainder; if there is no
remainder the concurrent is 7, and 24 March is a Saturday.
Easter

Christian Europe reform touched on the far more ticklish problem
of Easter.
In 1538 the Golden Number was 19, indicating luna XIV on
17 April; since this was a Wednesday, Easter fell on the 21st. Martin
Luther observed that, according to the rule of the ﬁrst Sunday after
the ﬁrst full moon of spring, it ought to have fallen on 17 March,
which of course preceded the ecclesiastically deﬁned equinox on the
21st. Had the New Style already been in force, but unaccompanied
by any further reform, that day would have been called the 27th;
however, it would not have been Easter because the Golden
Number would still have indicated luna XIV on 17 April. Since this
would now have been a Saturday, Easter would have fallen on
18 April, corresponding to the 8th Old Style and nearer new moon
than full.
Moreover, to recalculate the lunar epacts – for example, reducing
57

that of Golden Number 19 from 18 to 11, so that luna XIV became
25 March and Easter 1538 the 27th – would have been only a
short-term solution, for the lunar calendar too was wrong (as Roger
of Hereford had observed in the 12th century). Over 76 years, leap
days included, it comprised 27 759 days; the corresponding 940
synodic months comprise (on average) 27 758.754 6 days, putting
the moon some 5 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds ahead of the
calendar. This discrepancy would reach a day every 310 years,
making the epacts wrong again. A more fundamental reform was
needed; it was enacted by Gregory XIII.

The History of Time

The Gregorian calendar
Pope Gregory’s reform had three objectives: to restore the date of
the vernal equinox, 21 March, universally though wrongly believed
to have been decreed at Nicaea; to keep it there in future; and to
reconcile the Easter calendar, so far as possible, with the moon.
The ﬁrst two were achieved by the New Style discussed in Chapter
2; the third objective, reform of the lunar calendar, was met by
substituting for the simple Alexandrian 19-year cycle a highly
complicated system based on the epact of the year, redeﬁned as the
lune of 31 December preceding (see Figure 14).
At each centennial common year the epacts are diminished by 1, but
every 300 years they are increased by 1 save that every eighth such
increase is delayed by a century; when both rules apply to the same
year there is no change. These adjustments slightly over-correct the
discrepancy between lunar calendar and moon. It is the epact, not
as in the Julian calendar the Golden Number, that is used to ﬁnd the
lune of any given day. (The necessary tables will be found in the
Oxford Companion to the Year, pp. 825–8.)
The reformers did not specify the longitude by which they
calculated their new moons; this was necessary because they had
often deliberately placed them a day or two late in order to avoid
coincidence with Passover. This in Jewish usage no longer meant
58

14. Page of the Gregorian Easter table
59

14 Nisan but the 15th and in the Diaspora the 16th; in consequence,
many Christians imagined they were forbidden to celebrate
Easter on those dates (though Luther had taken the Passover
of 16–17 March 1538 as conﬁrmation of his case). Whereas
15 Nisan, at least according to the current Jewish calendar, had not
coincided with Julian Easter since 783, the 16th not since 1315,
Gregorian Easter, despite the displaced epacts, fell on 15 Nisan in
1609 and on the 16th six times before the end of the 16th century.
Protestants did not fail to complain.

The History of Time

Astronomical Easter
In 1699 the German Lutherans voted to accept the New Style, by
passing directly from 18 February 1700 to 1 March, but not the
Gregorian Easter tables. Instead, they decreed that Easter should be
governed by the real spring equinox and the real full moon as
indicated in the best astronomical tables available, based on the
meridian of Tycho Brahe’s laboratory at Uraniborg in Denmark.
This method was known as the calculus astronomicus. (John Dee in
1582 had already suggested that astronomically based Easter tables
should be drawn up for the meridian of London.) The reform was
adopted by Denmark, most of the Protestant Swiss cantons, and,
under the name ‘Improved Julian Calendar’, by the remaining
Dutch provinces.
Difference usually arose when the real full moon fell on a Saturday,
but the Gregorian tables indicated the following Sunday, entailing a
week’s postponement of Easter. This happened in 1700 itself, when
only the Gregorian date was observed; but the next discrepancy, in
1724, was the subject of anxious debate. The Pope’s tables set down
luna XIV on 9 April, again a Sunday, entailing Easter on the 16th,
but once more the real new moon fell the day before. Easter would
therefore, according to the calculus astronomicus, be the 9th, one
week earlier than in Roman Catholic countries.
However, a difﬁculty was raised that was none the less keenly felt
60

for being spurious, namely coincidence with the second day of
Passover. That led to a re-examination of the supposed prohibition;
the outcome was that German and Swiss Protestants kept the
astronomical date, though Denmark did not. (The Dutch
Protestants, in this and all other cases, kept the Gregorian date.) As
a result, Bach’s St John Passion was ﬁrst performed in Leipzig on
astronomical Good Friday, 7 April 1724, a week ahead of the
Gregorian Good Friday – and also, as it happened, of Julian Good
Friday on 3 April Old Style.

Before the next discrepancy, in 1778, the German Protestants,
followed by the Swiss and the Danes, abandoned the calculus
astronomicus at the behest of Frederick the Great, who had
acquired a large number of Roman Catholic subjects through the
First Partition of Poland (1772); his insincere pretext, coincidence
with Passover, also deterred the Swedes from observing the
astronomical date in 1778 and 1798, but they did keep it three times
in the early 19th century, before abandoning it in 1823. Finland,
part of Sweden till 1809 and then ceded to Russia, did so a further
three times, the last in 1845.
The case of 1798, however, illustrates a difﬁculty inherent in the
astronomical era: although at Uraniborg full moon occurred just
before midnight on Saturday, 31 March, in most of Sweden it was
already Sunday, 1 April, so that observance of the astronomical
Easter on that day would have entailed celebrating on the day of full
61

Easter

Sweden had held aloof in a failed attempt to adopt the New Style
painlessly; in 1740 the calculus astronomicus was introduced, but
Old Style dating remained till 1753. Thus in 1742, when Protestant
and Roman Catholic Easter both fell on 25 March New Style, in
Sweden it was called the 14th. Two years later, another discrepancy
arose between astronomical and Gregorian Easter; this time not
only German and Swiss Protestants but Denmark too kept the
astronomical date, 29 March. Sweden kept the same day, but called
it the 18th.

moon, a major impropriety. This case must occasionally arise in the
calculus astronomicus whatever the meridian chosen.

Great Britain

The History of Time

When Great Britain adopted the New Style, the political necessity of
crediting the reform to Parliament and not the Pope required that
the Church of England should be spared the humiliation of
accepting the Gregorian Easter tables; on the other hand, High
Churchmen would have objected to adopting the Lutheran
astronomical Easter used in George II’s electorate of Hanover. It
was therefore necessary to achieve the Pope’s results by different
means.
The solution was to devise tables (to be found in the Book of
Common Prayer) for reassigning the Golden Numbers to different
dates each century. This plan had been considered by the papal
reformers, but rejected because, in order to show the lune of every
day in the year, thirty different tables would have been needed; that
rejection made it all the more attractive to the Church of England,
which had no interest in the lunar calendar except for ﬁnding
Easter. For the same reason, the Golden Numbers, which previously
had been written against the year’s new moons, were now made to
mark directly the Paschal term or ‘Ecclesiastical Full Moon’. The
Church of England thus always celebrates Easter on the same day as
the Church of Rome, but without breathing a word about epacts.

The Orthodox churches
The most sensitive proposal in the ‘Revised Julian Calendar’ that
certain Orthodox Churches approved in May 1923 was the upset to
the centuries-old tradition of the ‘Nicene’ – or rather Alexandrian –
Easter, the feast of feasts, by adopting the calculus astronomicus
based on the meridian of Jerusalem. Although for a few years
after 1923 some churches kept non-Julian dates, tradition soon
reasserted itself; Easter is still kept according to the Julian calendar
62

by almost all Orthodox churches (the Finnish minority church –
though not that of the Russian community – and a few Western
parishes have adopted the Gregorian calendar in full).
In 1997 another decision was taken to adopt the astronomical
Easter from 2001, when it would coincide with the Julian as well as
the Gregorian date; but in 2002 it was the Julian date that was kept.
If no further reform takes place in either calendar, from 6700 to
6799 Orthodox Easter will coincide with Western Pentecost, though
the nominal dates in the Revised Julian Calendar will be one day
later.

Fixed Easter

In 1723, observing that in the next year Protestants would keep a
different Easter from Roman Catholics, the Swiss mathematician
Jean Bernoulli proposed that the feast should always be the ﬁrst
Sunday after 21 March; in 1834 Marco Mastroﬁni, after setting
forth his scheme for an invariable calendar (see Chapter 5),
suggested more tentatively that if it were accepted, Easter should be
ﬁxed as Sunday, 2 April. In 1926 the League of Nations
recommended that the feast should be kept on the Sunday after the
second Saturday in April; in the United Kingdom this provision was
incorporated in an Act of Parliament, to take effect upon general
agreement amongst the churches. Such agreement has not been
reached.
63

Easter

Certain early Christian communities had kept a ﬁxed Easter on
25 March or 6 April, respectively the 14th of the Cappadocian
month Teireix and of the ‘Province of Asia’ month Artemision;
the former had the advantage of being not only the feast of the
Annunciation but the traditional date of the Cruciﬁxion in the
Western church and the Resurrection in the Eastern. Luther
recommended that Easter should be made immovable like
Christmas; but the notion of Easter on a day other than Sunday has
had no subsequent appeal.

Chapter 5
Weeks and seasons

As we saw in Chapter 3, the ancient Romans had an eight-day
market-cycle, the nundinum, independent of months and years,
registered in their calendars by labelling each day with a letter from
A to H. This acquired an ultimately victorious rival in the seven-day
cycle known as the week. However, the week as we know it is the
fusion of two conceptually different cycles: the planetary week,
originally beginning on Saturday, derived from Hellenistic astrology,
and the Judaeo-Christian week, properly beginning on Sunday.
Whereas astrology was alien to both Greek and Egyptian tradition,
in Babylonia planetary observations had long been used to predict
affairs of state; during the 5th century bc the principles were
extended to predict the fates of individuals. By then, both Babylonia
and Egypt were part of the Persian Empire; although Egypt for a
time regained independence, it was reconquered shortly before
Alexander the Great’s defeat of Persia brought about the cultural
and political upheaval across the known world that enabled a
would-be science of the future to spread, and with it the principle
of planetary dominion.
It was from this time on that astrologers, ﬁrst in Egypt and then

with the daytime hours) are marked N(ocens), ‘harmful’, if under Saturn
or Mars; b(ona), ‘favourable’, if under Jupiter or Venus; c(ommunis),
‘neutral’, if under Sun, Mercury, or Moon. The text underneath reads:
‘When it is Saturn’s day or his hour by night or day, all things become
dark and difﬁcult; those who are born will be in danger; he who
disappears will not be found; he who takes to his sickbed will be in
danger; stolen goods will not be recovered.’

(see Figure 15). Since the 24 hours of the natural day accommodated
three planetary cycles with three hours, and therefore three planets,
left over, the next day was ruled by the next planet but two: after
Saturn the Sun, after the Sun the Moon, and so on (see box).
This planetary week would spread east to India and China, and
west to Rome, where it attained written record in the reign of
Augustus (sole ruler 31 bc–ad 14), under whom the poet Tibullus
mentions ‘the day sacred to Saturn’ and an inscription presents the
eight-letter A–H cycle of the nundinum accompanied by a
seven-letter A–G cycle for the week (see Figure 16).

letters

The History of Time

An early stage in the victory of week over nundinum is presented by
a grafﬁto at Pompeii giving the market-days in various towns and
cities: although eight place-names are listed, beginning with
Pompeii and ending with Capua (Rome is seventh), the
neighbouring column presents the days of the week from ‘Sat.’ to
‘Ven.’ Unfortunately the writer wrote column by column rather than
line by line, so generously spacing the days and so tightly cramping
the cities that we cannot even be sure whether he noticed the
discrepancy (Figure 17).
Jews, meanwhile, had been observing a week of their own, in
which six working days, numbered from 1 to 6, were followed by a
rest day, or shabbat, in English ‘Sabbath’. Shabbat coincided with
the astrological Saturday, which was a day of ill-omen because
Saturn was a baleful planet; for this reason, pagan writers
misrepresent it as a joyless fast-day. To be sure, Sabbath
regulations, in some quarters at least, were sterner than they have
since become; the Book of Jubilees, for instance, forbids married
couples to make love on that day, which the rabbinical tradition
positively encourages them to do, but even this text prohibits
fasting. Nevertheless, these pagan accounts seem more
appropriate to the Babylonian day of ill-omen on the 7th, 14th,
21st, and 28th of the month, in which some writers have seen the
origin of the Sabbath, but which would seem rather to have been
adapted to the astrological Saturday, subjected to the most malign
of planets.
Shabbat was the last day of the Jewish week, but corresponded to
the ﬁrst day of the planetary week. However, since nobody likes an
inauspicious beginning, by the 2nd century ad the astrologer
Vettius Valens was reckoning the planetary week from Sunday.
Although the Sun was not an auspicious planet like Jupiter or
Venus, neither was it malign, like Saturn or Mars (see box, p. 70).
The change also had the effect of aligning the planetary and Jewish
weeks; in a society that used the Jewish divine name Iao in its
magic, this may not have been accidental.
68

17. Grafﬁto from Pompeii showing conﬂation of week and market-cycle; the right-hand half presents days of two months

Tuesday: lucky or unlucky?
Mars’s day, even under its Christian name of ‘Third’, is an
unlucky day for Greeks, not only because Constantinople fell
on it; Westerners, forgetting the beneﬁcence of Venus, have
transferred its bad luck to Friday, the day of the Cruciﬁxion.
In Jewish tradition, by contrast, Tuesday is auspicious
because ‘And God saw that it was good’ occurs twice in the

The History of Time

Creation narrative for the third day.

By then Christians had adopted the Jewish week with its numbered
days, though for ‘ﬁrst day’ they said ‘Lord’s Day’. For Greekspeakers Monday to Thursday were the second to ﬁfth day
respectively and Friday the Preparation (from John 19: 31), Latinspeakers called Monday to Friday the second to sixth feria
respectively, extracting from classical feriae ‘holiday’ a new singular
that is still used in technical discussions of the calendar in
preference to the circumlocution ‘day of the week’. The seventh day
remained ‘Sabbath’ in both languages, but the Jewish rules were
not observed by the Gentile church; at Rome it even became the
custom to fast on that day, which shocked the Christians of the
East.
Evidence from Roman Egypt shows courts observing a weekly
break on Thursday, enjoying the benevolence of its presiding planet
Jupiter; but in 321 the Christian emperor Constantine decreed that
suits should not be heard on ‘the day celebrated for the veneration
of its Sun’. He did not use the Christian term ‘Lord’s Day’ (the
majority of the Empire’s citizens were still pagan), though a court
record from four years later does so; later laws sometimes combine
the two names. These ordinances converted Sunday from a weekly
remembrance of the Resurrection to a day of rest, though even in
the 6th century Bishop Caesarius of Arles was complaining that the
70

local peasantry rested on Thursday instead. (This was till recently
the traditional day off in French schools.)
In the Christianized empire the planetary names competed with the
Christian, with varying outcomes to be discerned from the modern
languages (see box). In Greek and Portuguese the Christian
terminology triumphed; in other Romance languages Sunday and
Saturday became ‘Lord’s Day’ and ‘Sabbath’, but the other planetary
names in general refused to be dislodged (though in Sardinia Friday
became kenapura, ‘pure supper’, commemorating the Last Supper).
The Britons proved even more resistant to the Christian terms; all
seven planetary names are easily recognized in Welsh, Cornish, and
Breton.

The History of Time

The Germanic peoples stood almost as ﬁrm: as the Romans had
substituted Roman deities for Greek, so they substituted their own:
for Mars, either the warrior god called Tı̄w in English and Týr in
Norse, or a god of the warband in assembly (thing) found on
inscriptions as Mars Thincsus (whence Dutch Dinsdag, German
Dienstag); for Mercury, as god of wisdom, Odin; for Jupiter, as
thunder-god, Thor; for Venus, the love-goddess Frigg. In English
and Dutch no further change has been made; Saturn, for whom the
Germanic pantheon had no equivalent, is left in place as lord of the
seventh day. In German there are modiﬁcations: Wednesday is
‘midweek’ (Mittwoch) as being halfway between Sunday and
Saturday, Saturday either the sabbath-day (Samstag) or
Sun(day)-eve (Sonnabend). The former, regularly used by Roman
Catholics, is now displacing the latter amongst Protestants, being a
more natural expansion of the abbreviation Sa. In dialects other
forms are found; Bavarian has Ertag for Tuesday, from pagan Greek
Áreōs, ‘of Ares’, and Pﬁnztag for Thursday, from Christian Greek
Pémptē ‘ﬁfth’.
The Slavs adopted a different system. Sunday was called
‘not-work’, nedělja; this underlies the name used in all
modern Slavonic except Russian, in which it means ‘week’
and Sunday is voskresen´e, ‘resurrection’ (a more learned form
of the word, Voskresenie, means ‘Easter’), though Monday
is still ‘the one after nedělja’, ponedel´nik. Saturday became
‘Sabbath’, but though Wednesday is ‘middle’ (compare Mittwoch),
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday have names derived from ‘two’,
‘four’, and ‘ﬁve’ respectively, counting not from Sunday as in
Church Greek and Latin but from Monday, which is the
ﬁrst day of the Orthodox liturgical week except between
Easter and Pentecost. Lithuanians (mostly Roman Catholics)
and Latvians (mostly Lutherans) also count from Monday,
the ﬁrst day of the week for commercial and administrative
secularists; by contrast, the Society of Friends used to number
the days of the week from ﬁrst to seventh from Sunday to
Saturday.
72

Islam adapted the Jewish week by making Friday the day of prayer
(not of rest, except in imitation of the West) with the Arabic name
of juma, ‘gathering’; the Sabbath remains in name though not in
nature, and the other feriae are still numbered from Sunday. (In
Kiswahili Saturday to Wednesday are days 1–5, while Thursday is
Alhamisi, Arabic for ‘the ﬁfth’.)

Sunday Letters

At Dover Dwells George Brown, Esquire,
Good Christopher Fitch And David Frier.

That is, 1 January is A, 1 February D, and so on; hence any
quantième in February will be three letters later in the cycle than
the same quantième in January.
Churchmen, interested in identifying Sundays, and especially
Easter Sunday, called these letters litterae dominicales or Sunday
Letters. The same term is used for the letter corresponding in
any given year to Sunday (see box); Easter is the ﬁrst Sunday
after luna XIV to bear the Sunday Letter of the year, between
22 March (D) and 25 April (C).

73

Weeks and seasons

The A–G cycle written in the Middle Ages and long afterwards
against the days of the year in calendars and almanacs made ﬁnding
the feria of any date easy; if today was Tuesday, one looked at its
letter in the calendar and knew that other days with the same letter
would also be Tuesday until either the bissextus (which shared the
letter F with the regular VI K. Mart.) or the New Year intervened.
It was made even easier by mnemonics that gave the letter for the
1st of every month; most were in execrable Latin, but an English
specimen runs:

Sunday Letters
To ﬁnd the Sunday Letter in the Julian calendar, divide the
year

AD

by 4, add the quotient to the year together with

the parameter 5; divide the total by 7. If the remainder is 0, the
Sunday Letter is A (meaning that all A days in the year are
Sundays); if it is 1, the Sunday Letter is G; if 2, F, if 3, E; if 4, D;
if 5, C; if 6, B. In leap year the Sunday Letter thus found is valid
from 25 February onwards; till then the next higher letter in
the cycle applies, so that the Sunday Letters of the year are BA,
CB, DC, ED, FE, GA. In the Gregorian calendar, the parameter to be added, which was 2 down to 31 December 1699, is

The History of Time

reduced by 1 at each non-centennial leap year: in 1900–2099
it is 6. (For a perpetual table of Sunday Letters, Julian and
Gregorian, see the Oxford Companion to the Year, p. 836.)

Assaults repelled
The French Republican calendar (see box) had no place for the
Christian week; instead, in accordance with the decimal principle
beloved of the revolutionaries, months were divided into three
10-day décades, each ending with a fête décadaire dedicated to an
entity ranging from the French People to Misfortune.
The competition between the two calendars was represented in
pamphlets as a conﬂict between the revolutionary Citoyen Décadi
and the reactionary Monsieur Dimanche. In 1798 the new calendar
was made compulsory, all observance of the week being forbidden.
Public workers who took Sunday off were to be dismissed; it was
even attempted to impose décadi on the Church instead of Sunday
as the day of worship. In much of France the campaign against the
week was a failure from the outset; it was given up by Napoleon
even while the calendrier français remained ofﬁcially in force.
74

The French Republican calendar
In 1793 the Convention enacted a new calendar on Alexandrian lines, backdated to the establishment of the French
Republic on 22 September 1792. The year comprised 12
months of 30 days plus 5 jours complémentaires, or 6 before
the Julian leap year; hence year VII (1798/9) was a leap year
(année sextile) even though Gregorian 1800 was not. The
month names reﬂected the French climate and the French
agricultural year, with a different sufﬁx for each season:
autumn -aire, winter -ôse, spring -al, and summer -dor.

The scheme was intended to combine generous individual leave
with continuous production, in which it failed, and to disrupt
religious observance and family life, in which it succeeded well
enough to provoke excessive discontent. As a result, the reform was
modiﬁed: from 1 December 1931 the traditional months were
restored, and also the uniform rest-day, but not the week; instead
the rest days were to be the 6th, the 12th, the 18th, the 24th, and
(except in February) the 30th of each month. Although the regime
persuaded Westerners sympathetic to communism or to calendar
reform that urban workers no longer remembered the seven-day
week, the peasantry sabotaged it by taking both Sundays and the
75

Weeks and seasons

Another challenge to the week came from the Soviet Union. In
the new calendar of 1929, which gave all 12 months the same
length of 30 days, interspersed with ﬁve national holidays, the
seven-day week was replaced with a ﬁve-day cycle from Monday
to Friday (or ‘ﬁrst’ to ‘ﬁfth’) without the ‘bourgeois idlers’ Saturday
and Sunday; each of the ﬁve days was a rest-day for one-ﬁfth of
the population, every citizen receiving a coloured slip
corresponding to his or her day off. (The national holidays were
excluded from the cycle.)

new rest-days off; in 1940 Stalin restored the seven-day week with
Sunday rest.

The History of Time

Besides these revolutionary schemes, reformist proposals have been
made from time to time for standardizing the relation between date
and feria by excluding one day from the week in each year, or two
days in leap year; such days are termed blank days. Although in
1834 Marco Mastroﬁni merely proposed to exclude 31 December
and leap day (which was to follow it) from the week, so that
1 January should always be a Sunday, and then to ﬁx Easter on
9 April, other reformers envisaged broader schemes to regularize
the months or at least the seasons.
As early as 1745, in a letter to the Gentleman’s Magazine, ‘Hirossa
Ap-Iccim’ proposed that the year should contain 13 months, each
comprising four weeks, followed by a blank day for Christmas and a
national day in leap year; that 11 December 1745 Old Style should
become 1 January 1750 in a new era beginning in 4 bc; that leap
year should be suppressed every 132 years; and that weights,
measures, and money should be reckoned in multiples of eight. The
author was a Maryland clergyman, the Revd Hugh Jones, who
dedicated a fuller exposition of these notions to the Earl of
Chesterﬁeld (British Library, Add. MS 21893) and published them
over the name ‘H. J.’ as The Pancronometer (London, 1753). No
notice was taken; however, a 13-month year was the basis of the
Positivist calendar, with epoch 1789, promulgated by Auguste
Comte in 1849 and still enjoying some currency in France and
Brazil. Months and days were dedicated to great men and the
occasional great woman; the 365th day is dedicated to the dead,
leap day to holy women.
In the early 20th century the 13-month year was adopted for
internal accounting by several companies. On this basis two
businessmen in the United States, the English-born Moses
B. Cotsworth and George Eastman of Eastman Kodak, set about
converting the world to an International Fixed Calendar, better
76

known as the Eastman Plan, in which a 13th month called Sol
should precede July, and blank days should be observed on
29 December (Year Day) and in leap year 29 June (Leap Day).
Far too hardheaded to shrink from a year with 13 Friday the 13ths,
Eastman observed that 13 was the lucky number of a country
founded by 13 insurgent colonies.
Outside the United States, this argument naturally cut less ice.
Some reformers toned down the reform by proposing 12-month
years in which every third month should comprise ﬁve weeks
instead of four; but more attention was paid to a ‘World Calendar’ in
which March, June, September, and December should have 31 days
and the rest 30, again with blank days after December and in leap
year after June.

Seventh-Day Adventists also objected to the disruption, and the
imperial government of India, aware of the many sensibilities that
would be offended, declared it unacceptable. By contrast, when the
World Calendar was brieﬂy revived in the 1950s, it was favoured by
the committed secularists who ruled that country after
independence; however, no major power saw any advantage in the
reform, and since then campaigners for a better world have directed
their energies to more pressing concerns. The week thus remains
77

Weeks and seasons

In the 1920s the League of Nations took an interest in both
the Eastman Plan and the World Calendar; but the interruption
to the week proved a stumbling-block. In 1931 the Chief Rabbi
of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire,
Dr Joseph Hertz (see Figure 18), delivered an impassioned
attack on the reforms at League headquarters in Geneva,
emphasizing the impossibility of Orthodox Jews’ accepting
an eight-day interval between Sabbaths, and the inconvenience
they would suffer by observing the Sabbath on another day
than Saturday. His intervention had an effect best gauged
by the bitter resentment it aroused among secularist
reformers.

the oldest calendrical institution still to function without structural
change.

The week-based year

Dr Hertz, however, may have had in mind the 364-day year used or
advocated by some Jews during the Second Temple Period
comprising 12 months, of which every third month contained
31 days and the rest 30; the week began not on First Day (Sunday)
but on Fourth Day (Wednesday), the day on which the sun and
moon were created. It is disputed how ancient this calendar was
(some scholars even suggest it, or something like it, was the preExilic norm), nor how widespread its use was at any time; it is also
disputed whether ekeweeks were added, or adherents took the
view, if calendar and sun were out of step, so much the worse for
the sun.

79

Weeks and seasons

When Dr Hertz addressed the League of Nations, he declared that
Jews had no objection to calendar reform as such, provided that it
left the week untouched; in particular, if a ﬁxed relation between
feria and date were intended, it could be achieved by a year of
52 weeks or 364 days, with a leap week added from time to time.
This met with no approval, even though a 364-day year with leap
weeks had been known for centuries in Iceland, where it regulated
civil affairs; it comprised 12 months of 30 days (or rather nights),
four epagomenal days or ekenights (aukanætr), and in ﬁve years out
of 28 an ekeweek (aukavika). It was based on the old Germanic
two-season alternation of ‘summer’ and ‘winter’, but was correlated
with the Church calendar, from which it adopted the week and the
solar cycle; indeed, dates were normally reckoned not by months
(except in the latter part of winter, the very portion of the year King
Romulus had supposedly not provided months for) but by the
number of weeks remaining before or elapsed after midsummer or
before midwinter.

Other groupings
Old Irish legal texts recognize groups of 5 and 15 days, the latter
surviving from the half-months of the pre-Christian lunar calendar.
Market-cycles 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10 days long are or have been used in
many parts of the world, besides the Roman 8-day nundinum;
more than one people of Nigeria makes use of the 4-day cycle and
its 8- and 16-day multiples in several contexts.

The History of Time

When towns or villages hold markets on different days of the same
cycle, this constitutes a link between them; on the other hand, when
as notably in West Africa more than one market-cycle coexists in a
particular locality, there may be especial solidarity between those
villages that share a cycle and rivalry between those that do not,
particularly if they hold markets on the same day.
The week, and the analogues discussed so far, run concurrently with
months and years; Sunday the 1st is followed by Monday the 2nd,
Wednesday 31 December 2003 by Thursday 1 January 2004. In
some cultures, however, the quasi-weeks themselves run
concurrently: in Central America, before the Spanish conquest, the
cycles of 13 and 20 days that formed the 260-day cycle did so (see
Chapter 6), and no fewer than 9 concurrent cycles, from 2 to 10 days
long, are found in Indonesia; of these the 5-, 6-, and 7-day cycles are
the most important, combining to form a 210-day odalan.

Seasons
The Western world has inherited from the ancient Romans the
division of the year into four seasons or ‘times of year’ (tempora
anni, whence German Jahreszeiten): few Latin words are easier to
translate into modern European languages than ver aestas
autumnus hiems. Diagrams of the cosmos show these seasons
integrated into a world-model (see Figure 19); they reappear in
another temperate-zone culture, that of China, as chūn xià qiū
dūng.

81

The History of Time

Yet this division is by no means universal. In Nigeria the
Yoruba speak of two half-year seasons, dry and rainy; but
India has six seasons, whose Sanskrit names are grı̄sma (‘hot
˙
season’), varsa (‘rainy season, monsoon’), śarad (‘autumn’),
˙
hemanta (‘winter’), śiśir (‘cool season’), vasanta (‘spring’).
Each comprises two months; these differ across the country,
but in the National Calendar (see Chapter 6) spring begins in
Phalguna.
Ancient Egypt recognized three seasons: ﬂood, winter, and
summer, each comprising four months of the solar year, which until
the 6th century bc were simply numbered as the so-manyeth
month of such-and-such season (see Appendix A). However, the
failure to intercalate meant that for much of Egyptian history
nominal and real seasons did not correspond. In 824 bc, for
instance, when the New Year began on 21 March, ‘winter’ ran from
the theoretical beginning of ﬂood on 19 July to 15 November,
followed by ‘summer’.
Classical Greek knows spring (éar, or in a dialectal variant wêr),
summer (théros), and winter (cheimō´n), but a distinct concept of
and name for autumn (phthinópōron, ‘waning harvest’) took a long
time to emerge. However, the great Greek historian Thucydides
(5th–4th century bc), though familiar with spring, divided the
years of the Peloponnesian War into summer (the campaigning
season) and winter.
A similar two-season conception existed amongst the Germanic
peoples, proving especially resilient not only in Iceland, but also in
Scandinavia, where summer is said to begin on St Tiburtius’ day
(14 April) and winter on St Callistus’ day (14 October). In
consequence, although the Germanic languages all share the words
‘summer’ and ‘winter’, they had no words for ‘spring’ and ‘autumn’
until they encountered Roman culture. The names for those two
seasons vary considerably between languages, and even within
them: whereas British English has retained the Latin or French
82

‘autumn’ used by Chaucer, Tyndale, and Shakespeare, the US uses
‘fall’, short for ‘fall of the leaf’, ﬁrst attested in the 16th century. In
German, spring may be either der Frühling or das Frühjahr; an
archaic or poetic term Lenz corresponds to current Dutch lente and
Old English lencten. This latter was used both of the season and of
an ecclesiastical fast; the fast is still called by the shortened form
Lent, of which Lenten (as in Lenten sermon) is now understood as
the adjective; the season has since the 16th century been ‘spring’,
short for ‘spring of the year’.

Latin writers offer various dates for the beginnings of the seasons:
the Elder Pliny (d. ad 79) gives 8 February, 10 May, 11 August,
11 November; Isidore of Seville (d. 636) gives 22 February, 24 May,
23 August, 23 November; the Venerable Bede, writing in 725, gives
7 February, 9 May, 7 August, 7 November, in other words, the
seventh day before the Ides of the respective months. Both Isidore’s
and Bede’s dates are commonly given in medieval calendars; on
Bede’s scheme, the equinoxes and solstices fall about the middle of
their seasons, so that the Nativity of the Baptist is Midsummer’s
Day. Likewise, the normal Old English name for Christmas was
‘midwinter’.
In Ireland spring is reckoned from 1 February, summer from 1 May,
autumn from 1 August, and winter from 1 November; of these dates
1 February is St Bride’s, or Brigid’s, day, to the obliteration of the
pre-Christian Imbolc (in modern Irish Oímelc) that originally
marked the new season, but the other three retain their ancient
names of Bealtaine, Lúnasa (formerly Lughnasadh), and Samhain.
The Oxford English Dictionary regards this as the ‘British’
83

Weeks and seasons

In the Celtic languages too ‘spring’ and ‘autumn’ vary, but there are
shared words for ‘summer’ and ‘winter’; the two-season division is
explicitly stated in an Irish glossary. Irish samhradh and Welsh haf
are related to English summer, geimreadh and gaeaf to Latin hiems;
the same words underlie the Gaulish month names Samonios and
Giamonios (see Chapter 6).

disposition, as opposed to a ‘North American’ practice of beginning
the seasons with March, June, September, and December; but most
Britons would prefer the latter, which is the scheme adopted by the
Meteorological Ofﬁce.
Naturally, no system based on natural phenomena can be valid all
over the globe, or even within the northern hemisphere; more
objective is the principle of beginning seasons with the equinoxes
and solstices, hence currently on or about 20 March, 21 June,
22 September, and 21 December. These are often described as the
‘ofﬁcial’ beginnings of the respective seasons, although no royal
proclamation or Act of Parliament has so decreed. Neatness of
scheme often trumps truth to fact: the 11th-century diagram shown
above in Figure 19 blithely equates seasons determined on this
principle with three-month blocks beginning in April, July,
October, and January.
From the time of Caesar’s reform, Roman tradition equated these
cardinal points with the eighth day before the Kalends, on
25 March, 24 June, 24 September, and 25 December, dates that
in fact had applied some two centuries earlier. The Church
incorporated them into its calendar as respectively the
Annunciation (the Conception of Jesus Christ), the Nativity
of St John the Baptist, his Conception (shifted in the East to the
23rd; see Chapter 6), and the Nativity of Jesus Christ. However,
the Western church preferred to begin the seasons with fasts
on the Wednesday after Quadragesima, Whit Sunday, Holy
Cross day (14 September), and St Lucy’s day (13 December),
each resumed on the following Friday and Saturday. These are
known in English as the Ember fasts, a corruption (compare
German Quatember) of Latin quattuor tempora, ‘the four
seasons’. (The Church of England has changed the weeks.)
Although in the southern hemisphere summer corresponds to
northern winter and vice versa, European settlement has imported
many northern associations of date and season. Papai Noel is
84

cruelly sent out into the heat of a Brazilian summer wearing his
heavy red suit and white fur; but Latvians in Australia celebrating
St John’s day in the winter cold of 24 June are glad of their
wool-based national costume.

Other calendars

The Jewish calendar
The modern Jewish lunar calendar, based on calculation like the
Gregorian but far more complex, evolved out of one used after the
return from Babylonian exile, based on observation. Before then
the months, though occasionally given Phoenician names, were
normally numbered; the count began in spring even though the
harvest is said in Exodus to come at the end of the year. It is
disputed whether the calendar was lunar or solar, and in the latter
case what relation it bore to the post-Exilic 52-week year discussed
in Chapter 5.
After the Exile, the old habit of numbering months gradually
gave way to use of the Babylonian names (but also of
Macedonian names when Jews were speaking Greek);
the spring New Year, on 1 Nisan, and the autumn New
Year, on 1 Tishri, continued to compete for many centuries.
The latter was always used to reckon the seven-year sabbatical
cycle, in the ﬁnal year of which cultivation was not permitted;
the rule of thumb for biblical exegesis was that for ‘kings of Israel’
years were counted from Nisan, for other kings from Tishri, but
exceptions could not be denied. The eventual compromise was
that ‘Nisan is the head of the months, Tishri is the head of the
year’: although the months speciﬁed in the Torah for the major
86

festivals are counted from the spring, the deﬁnitive civil year begins
in the autumn.

Embolism consisted in repeating the last month, Adar, of the
spring-to-spring year, when it appeared that otherwise Passover
would come too early. Before the Roman destruction of the Temple
in ad 70 there seems to have been a preference for late Passovers, so
that the pilgrims should have plenty of time to reach Jerusalem;
afterwards, when early Passovers no longer caused difﬁculty, it
became the rule to intercalate when any two of three conditions
should obtain: that the crops were still young, that the fruit-trees
were not ripe, that the festival would otherwise precede the
equinox. There was also a preference for intercalating presabbatical years rather than sabbatical or post-sabbatical ones.
Contrary to Christian suppositions, it was not an absolute rule that
Passover should follow the equinox, though it must usually have
done so while the Temple stood. The assertion that Jews were not
observing their own rules had more justiﬁcation in the readiness
of Diaspora communities to regulate the calendar for themselves,
87

Other calendars

So long as the new moon was determined by observation, if on the
30th night the crescent was reliably reported and conﬁrmed by
the Sanhedrin, then the day (beginning at sunset) was reckoned
as the ﬁrst of the month, the previous month being hollow.
Otherwise it was treated as the 30th of the old month, and the new
month began the following night. A certain degree of manipulation
was admitted to prevent fasts, in particular Yom Kippur, from
falling on the day before or after the Sabbath (there was no
objection to coincidence with the Sabbath itself ); as a result 1 Tishri
could not be a Wednesday or a Friday. Considerably later it became
a rule that 1 Tishri must not fall on a Sunday either, since the ritual
for the last day of Succoth (Tabernacles), on 21 Tishri, was deemed
too energetic for the Sabbath. There was also a rule that no year
should have fewer than four full months or more than eight; in
embolismic years this limit was raised to nine.

rather than following the rabbis of Jerusalem: at Antioch, for
instance, the rule was that 14 Nisan should fall within the
civil month of Dystros, which was the local name of Roman
March.

The History of Time

Tradition, unsupported by evidence, has it that in ad 359
observation was replaced by calculation because the Romans were
obstructing the messengers sent from Jerusalem to announce new
moons and intercalations. In fact, however, a variety of practices,
including observation and calculation not in accordance with the
modern rules, persisted long afterwards; not till the 10th century
was full uniformity achieved.
The modern calendar operates in two stages: ﬁrst, the molad or
‘birth’ – the ﬁrst conjunction – of autumn is found, then the date of
1 Tishri derived from it. The day, subdivided into 24 equal hours
each comprising 1080 ‘minims’ of 76 ‘moments’, is reckoned from
sunset, which for calendrical purposes – but not for civil or religious
life – is normalized as 6 p.m. Jerusalem time (3.39 p.m. at
Greenwich); the synodic month is deﬁned as 29 days 12 hours
793 minims. The common year of 12 months thus contains
354 days 8 hours 876 minims; the embolismic year has 13 months,
making 383 days 21 hours 589 minims.
Embolisms take place in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of a Metonic
cycle, comprising 235 lunations = 6939 days 16 hours 595 minims;
the cycles are reckoned from the Creation at 5 hours 204 minims on
Monday, 7 October 3761 bc, which in our midnight-to-midnight
reckoning would be 11 hours 11 minutes 20 seconds p.m. on Sunday
the 6th. The molad of year Y will thus take place as many days,
hours, and minims after that epoch as are contained in the (Y − 1)
theoretical years elapsed.
Once the molad has been found, a date for 1 Tishri is sought at a
permitted distance from the previous 1 Tishri and the next. There
are six possible lengths of the year:
88

common deﬁcient

353 days embolismic deﬁcient

383 days

common regular

354 days abundant regular

384 days

common abundant 355 days embolismic abundant 385 days

The day of molad is designated 1 Tishri subject to four conditions:

According as 1 Tishri is postponed by 0, 1, or 2 days, the preceding
year is deﬁcient, regular, or abundant.
The months are: Tishri, 30 days; Cheshvan (formerly
Marcheshvan), 29 (in an abundant year 30); Kislev, 30 (in a
deﬁcient year 29); Tebet, 29; Shebat, 30; Adar, 29 days, Nisan, 30;
Iyyar, 29; Sivan, 30; Tammuz, 29; Ab, 30; Ellul, 29. In embolismic
years Adar has 30 days, and is followed by Ve-Adar (also called Adar
Sheni) with 29 days, which takes over the festival of Purim from
Adar.
There is no simple formula for converting Jewish dates to
Gregorian, or vice versa; however, there is a rule for ﬁnding the
89

Other calendars

(i) if the molad falls at or after 18 hours (noon), 1 Tishri is postponed
by a day;
(ii) since 1 Tishri is not allowed to fall on Sunday, Wednesday, or
Friday, if the molad falls on those days, or if by the operation of
rule (i) 1 Tishri would do so, it is postponed to Monday, Thursday,
and Saturday respectively;
(iii) if the molad of a common year occurs on Tuesday at or after
9 hours 204 minims, 1 Tishri is postponed to Thursday, since
otherwise the year would contain 356 days under rules (i) and (ii);
(iv) if the molad of a post-embolismic year occurs on Monday at or
after 15 hours 589 minims, 1 Tishri is postponed to Tuesday, since
otherwise the previous year, which must have begun after noon on
a Tuesday, would contain only 382 days.

Julian equivalent of 15 Nisan (Passover as now understood),
discovered by the mathematician C. F. Gauss; it is set out in the
Jewish Encyclopedia and the Oxford Companion to the Year,
851–2. Since this day is always 23 weeks and 2 days before 1 Tishri,
it can never fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

The History of Time

The Muslim calendar
Before Islam, the Arabs used a calendar of the usual lunisolar
type, combined with the Seleucid era (see Chapter 7) reckoned
from the Byzantine civil New Year on 1 September. The Prophet,
however, broke the link between months and seasons by forbidding
intercalation, relying purely on the moon and beginning the month
when the new moon had been observed in the night sky by reliable
witnesses; as a result, the Muslim calendar consists of 12 lunar
months without correction by the sun, so that 33 Muslim years
correspond within a few days to 32 Western years.
The months are called Muharram, Safar, Rabı̄  al-  awwal, Rabı̄ 
˙
˙
al-  ākhir, Jumadā ’l-  ūlā, Jumadā ’l-  ukhrā, Rajab, Sha  bān,

˙
straight through; but in classical Arabic an alternative system is
found in which the ﬁrst of the month (in daytime) is expressed as
‘one night being past’ and so on up to the 14th; the 15th is ‘the
middle’; the 16th is ‘fourteen nights remaining’, and so in
descending sequence to the last.
Since a calendar based on unpredictable local observations is
useless for astronomical purposes, a theoretical model was devised
in which the odd months are full and the even hollow, making
354 days in all. Since the synodic month is in fact a little longer than
29½ days, such a year will be short of 12 lunations by 0.367 08 day,
or not quite 8 hours 48 minutes 36 seconds; to compensate, the last
month of certain years is made full instead of hollow. The extra day
is currently added in 11 years of a 30-year cycle, namely years 2, 5, 7,
10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, and 29, which reduces the deﬁcit to
90

0.0124 day = 17 minutes 51.36 seconds. However, this has not been
uniform practice throughout the history of Islam.
Muslim years are reckoned from 16 Tammuz in the Seleucid year
933 = 16 July ad 622, the ﬁrst day of the Arab year in which the
Prophet departed from Mecca to Yathrib (now Medina); the Arabic
for ‘departure’ being hijra, the era is called hijrı̄. However,
especially in older records, the era may be counted from the
previous day, 15 July; this remained the practice amongst
astronomers, who began the day at noon instead of sunset. Even
in Iran, where the civil calendar is solar, the epoch is still the year
of the Hijra.

The Greek calendars
Ancient Greek civilization was a system of mutually accepted
variations: every city had its own dialect, its own alphabet, its own
festivals, and its own laws, but recognized the others as being Greek.
Naturally the calendars too varied; before Roman times these were
all, at least in theory, lunisolar, each city repeating a month as it saw
ﬁt. Although there were some widespread month names, there was
no uniﬁed system; from city to city the same lunation was called by
different names, and the same name applied to different lunations,
nor was there agreement on which lunation should begin the year
or be repeated for intercalation.
In some cities the middle ten days of the month were counted
separately from the ﬁrst ten, and in most cities the ﬁnal days were
91

Other calendars

For means of conversion between the theoretical Muslim calendar
and the Gregorian, see the Oxford Companion to the Year, 854–5.
However, the actual Western date to which the Muslim date of a
document or record corresponds may not be that given by such
means, and may not be knowable at all unless (as often happens)
the day of the week is given. The conversion should be adjusted to
match.

The History of Time

counted backwards; the last day was normally called triakás, the
30th, even when it was only the 29th, but at Athens the term was
hénē kaì néa, ‘old-and-new (day)’. In the Macedonian calendar,
however, at least as used in Asia and Egypt after Alexander’s
conquests, the tale of days ran straight through from 1 to 30, the
29th being omitted in hollow months.
It is not known which cities relied on observation and which on
calculation; but it is known that political or administrative
convenience might lead to interference with the regular sequence of
days. (The comic poet Aristophanes imagines the hungry gods
turning up for their festivals only to ﬁnd they are being kept on the
wrong day.) As a result, not even the quantième was constant
between one city and another: in 479 bc 4 Boedromion at Athens
was 27 Panamos in Boeotia; in 422 bc 14 Elaphebolion at Athens
was 12 Geraistios at Sparta, but a year later 25 Elaphebolion was
27 Artamihios. The report that Herostratus set ﬁre to the temple of
Artemis at Ephesus on the same day as Alexander the Great was
born, if not a total ﬁction, may mean only that it was the same
quantième in notionally corresponding months. Unless we are
aided by an eclipse, it is impossible to translate even an Attic (that
is, Athenian) date into a Julian, although we know the Attic
calendar better than any other.
Astronomers, using a lunar calendar of alternating full and hollow
days with embolismic months prescribed by a cycle, would
designate the months by Attic or Macedonian names (see box) for
their respectively cultural and political signiﬁcance without regard
to real-life calendars at Athens or in any of the lands conquered by
Alexander.
The Macedonian rulers of Egypt attempted to equate their own
calendar with the local lunisolar religious calendar. The task proved
beyond them; by the 2nd century bc they simply applied
Macedonian names to the months of the Egyptian civil year. They
had an easier time in Babylonia, where the local calendar was more
92

Attic and Macedonian month names
The ﬁrst Attic month, Hekatombaion, began at the new
moon following the summer solstice; intercalation was normally achieved by repeating Poseideon. Although very little
is known about the Macedonian calendar as operated in
Macedon itself, it appears that the ﬁrst month was Dios,
beginning after the autumnal equinox; the intercalary month
is unknown. In the table below, the equivalences must not be
regarded as hard and fast, only as applying more often than
not.

comprehensible; the months were given Macedonian names, so
that Nisanu became Artemisios. The spring New Year was retained,
so that the years of the Seleucid era remained six months behind
those used in other parts of the Near East; Seleucid year 1
Babylonian (the last of a Metonic cycle) began on 1 Artemisios/
Nisanu 311 bc. This calendar was retained when Babylonia fell

under Parthian domination; however, from ad 17 onwards the
Macedonian names are applied one Babylonian month later,
Artemisios now being Aiaru instead of Nisanu. It is on this
basis that the Jewish historian Josephus names Jewish months
in Greek.
In Roman times many cities adopted the Julian calendar, even if
with different month names and New Year: thus at Antioch October
was called Hyperberetaios, and began the year (as it continued to do
among Syriac-speakers) till the mid-5th century, when New Year
was moved back to 1 Gorpiaios (September). Others adopted
calendars on Julian principles, but with their own months; thus in
the province of Asia months began on IX Kal. Roman, and New
Year was Augustus’ birthday, 23 September. This remained the
ecclesiastical new year of the Eastern church, which celebrates the
Conception of John the Baptist (‘the Forerunner’) on that date
instead of the Western 24th.

The Gaulish calendar
In 1897 fragments of a calendar in Gaulish (the language spoken
at the time of Caesar’s invasion) were discovered at Coligny in the
département of Ain (see Figure 20). They have been the subject of
much study and more controversy; but it seems clear that the
inscription itself presents a quinquennium or 5-year cycle of
62 lunar months (with embolismic months at the beginning of
the ﬁrst year and the middle of the third), each divided into two
halves, the ﬁrst of 15 days and the second of either 15 or 14. In
both halves the days are counted forwards, but the sequence is
interrupted by some days’ changing places even between months.
Quinquennia were combined into larger cycles (originally of
30 years, later, it seems, of 25), in which the ﬁrst embolism of the
ﬁrst quinquennium was omitted.
The calendar gained gradually on the sun, though in the short term
this was masked by the inevitable shortfall or excess between
94

20. Gaulish calendar from Coligny
95

The History of Time

lunar and solar years. In principle, the ﬁrst month of the common
year, Samonios, began at the winter solstice; in practice, it slipped
a little earlier from cycle to cycle. On the assumption that
pre-Christian Ireland had used a similar calendar, this slippage
has been invoked to explain why the Irish festival of Samhain was
ﬁxed, once the Julian calendar was adopted, not at the winter
solstice but on 1 November, which it would have reached in the
mid-5th century.
The name Samonios is related to the Celtic word for ‘summer’;
likewise the seventh month, in principle beginning at the summer
solstice, was called Giamonios, from the word for ‘winter’. It
appears that the names were related to the solstitial celebrations at
the end of the respective seasons; the notion that samain (modern
Samhain) on 1 November is the end of summer reappears in a
glossary.

The Hindu calendars
Religious festivals in India are still determined by the many
local calendars, most but not all either solar or lunar. Until
1957 the year directly observed in the former, and by which
the latter were corrected, was not the tropical but the sidereal
year, divided into 12 months each corresponding to the sun’s
presence in a raśı̄; unlike the Western (and Chinese) sign of the
zodiac, this was not a conventional division of the ecliptic but
the actual constellation. As a result of the reform, the solar year
is now tropical, and the raśı̄ is a ﬁxed sector of the ecliptic,
corresponding to that occupied by the appropriate constellation
in 1957.
In solar calendars, the day begins at sunrise; the month begins
according to locality with the day of the sun’s entry into the new
raśı̄, the day after, or (in some cases) the day after that. The month
bears the name of the raśı̄ in question except in Bengal and Tamil
Nadu, which use the lunar month names.
96

In lunar calendars, months are divided into two ‘wings’ or halves, a
‘bright’ (waxing) half, from new moon to full, and a ‘dark’ (waning)
half, from full moon to new. There is a standard set of names, each
theoretically corresponding to a particular raśı̄; months are named
in accordance with the raśı̄ in which the sun is located at new
moon. In the south, and in theoretical astronomy, the month begins
with the bright half; but in the north (unless embolismic; see box) it
begins with the dark half, so that until new moon the month name
is one ahead of the south: thus northern Magha dark corresponds to
southern Pausa dark, but both are followed by Magha bright.
The ﬁrst day of each half-month is that following the new or full
moon; thereafter the day is generally numbered according to the
tithi current at sunrise, the tithi being the time taken by the moon
to travel 12° from the sun. Occasionally a quantième has to be
omitted (if a tithi begins after one sunrise and ends before the next)

In principle, the sun enters a new raśı̄ during the course of
each month; there are two qualiﬁcations.
(a) When the sun is in the same raśı̄ at the start of two successive months (reckoned on the southern system), the ﬁrst is
embolismic, with the same name as the regular month
following; the north too admits an embolismic month at
this point, dividing the regular month and beginning with
the bright half and not like others with the dark.
(b) When in winter the sun enters two raśı̄s in the same
month (again as reckoned in the south), the month name
corresponding to the ﬁrst raśı̄ will be omitted. The same
name is thus omitted in north and south.

or repeated (if a tithi begins before one sunrise and after the next).
Irregularity of quantième does not affect the feria: Sunday the 7th is
always followed by Monday even if the latter be the 9th, or the
7th again, and not the 8th.

The History of Time

There are numerous eras in use, mostly counted in elapsed years,
and several different New Year dates within them; the most
widely used is the Saka Era, used in both lunar and solar
calendars, with epoch ad 78, but mention must also be made of
the Vikram Samvat, used in lunar calendars, epoch 58 bc, and the
Kaliyuga, a period of 432 000 solar years beginning on 18
February 3102 bc. At its conclusion the world will enter into a
new age.
In addition, there are calendars based on the sidereal revolution of
Jupiter, which comprises 11.862 years; ﬁve such revolutions amount
to some 60 solar years.
Since 1957, for secular purposes, India has recognized two
calendars: the Gregorian and the National Calendar, reckoned by
the Saka Era; it uses the lunar month names and begins on
22 March (21 March in a Gregorian leap year).

Iranian calendars
Whereas the Achaemenid royal inscriptions seem to show a
lunisolar calendar like the Babylonian but with different month
names (and perhaps independent intercalations), the Parthian
dynasty of the Arsacids (247 bc–ad 226) and the Persian Sasanians
who supplanted it employed a solar calendar still used by
Zoroastrians, including the Parsis of India. The year is an annus
vagus of 365 days, comprising 12 months of 30 days (not numbered
but named after the presiding spirit) and ﬁve epagomenal days
named after the ﬁve groups of Gathas or Zoroastrian hymns; this
calendar is said to have displaced an earlier 360-day calendar with
embolisms every ﬁve or six years.
98

Just as the Egyptian year in principle begins at the heliacal rising
of Sirius, so the theoretical Iranian Nawruz or New Year’s Day is
the vernal equinox; however, since the annus vagus ran ahead
of the sun, in ad 631 Nawruz was 16 June. It is from that date that
the Zoroastrian era is reckoned, in years of Yäzdegird III, the last
pre-Islamic shah.

In the early 12th century the Parsis, but not the Zoroastrians of
Iran, intercalated an extra month (though without moving the
epagomenal days) for the sake of the coincidence; but there was no
repetition. In 1746 a proposal was made to reverse the intercalation,
bringing the Parsi calendar back into line with that used by the
Zoroastrians of Iran. Only a minority adopted it, but their calendar
(called ‘Kadmi’ or ‘former’ calendar) survives to this day besides the
majority Shenshai (understood to mean ‘imperial’ calendar). Thus
year 1374 of Yäzdegird began on 20 August 2004 in the Shensai
calendar, but 21 July in the Kadmi.
In 1906 a third calendar was put forward called Fasli (‘seasonal’)
or Bastani (‘ancient’), in which Nawruz was once more the vernal
equinox, and a sixth epagomenal day was added in Gregorian
leap years. Most Parsis rejected the reform as contrary to
religion; in Iran, by contrast, most Zoroastrians have accepted it,
not least because it is closer to the civil calendar introduced by
99

Other calendars

It is reported that, owing to ritual requirements, every 120 years, an
embolism was made, after which the epagomenal days were
postponed to follow the next regular month and thus revert to the
proper time of year; however, after eight embolisms the practice fell
into abeyance owing to war and turmoil, so that the extra days
continued to follow the eighth month. Not all scholars believe the
tradition, but the displacement of the epagomenal days under the
Sasanians is a fact; it was not reversed until year 375 of Yäzdegird,
when in response to the auspicious coincidence of Nawruz with the
equinox on 15 March 1006 they were restored to their original
position at the end of the year.

1979.

The History of Time

In this calendar, the ﬁrst six months of the year (Färvärdin,
Ordibehesht, Khordad, Tir, Mordad, Shährivar) have been given
31 days each to match the length of time from vernal to autumnal
equinox, the next ﬁve (Mehr, Aban, Azär, Dei, Bähmän) have 30, and
the last month in common years (Esfänd) has only 29. A 30th day is
added, in principle according to a rule proposed in the 11th century,
that the common year shall begin on the day when the sun enters
Aries before noon, the leap year when it does so after noon; this is
normally four years after the previous leap year but occasionally ﬁve.
In practice, however, a complex cycle has been calculated in advance
(see box). The era is reckoned from the vernal equinox before the
Hijra (in Farsi pronounced Hejre), 21 March ad 622.

Intercalation in the solar Hejri calendar
Intercalation is governed by a grand cycle of 2180 years,
consisting in order of:
21 cycles of 128 years, comprising:
1 small cycle of 29 years;
3 small cycles of 33 years;
1 cycle of 132 years, comprising:
1 small cycle of 29 years;
2 small cycles of 33 years;
1 small cycle of 37 years.
In each small cycle there is a leap year in year 5 and every
fourth year thereafter.
The current grand cycle is reckoned from AH 475 = AD 1096/7;
the current 128-year cycle began in AH 1371 = AD 1992/3.

100

A similar leap-year principle obtains in the Bahá’í calendar, whose
solar year contains 19 months of 19 days (19 being the Bahá’í
mystical number), with four epagomenal days and a ﬁfth when the
equinox falls later than sunset (the start of the Bahá’í day) on
21 March; but in practice the Gregorian or Iranian leap year is
often followed. The week begins on Saturday; the era is reckoned
from 1844.

The Chinese calendar

A 13th month is added, under current rules, in years 3, 6, 9, 11, 14,
17, and 19 of a Metonic cycle nine years behind the Western ‘Golden
Number’ cycle; the month repeated, which must not be a winter
month (1, 11, or 12), is that throughout which the sun will remain
within the same sign of the zodiac, subject to the rule that the
equinoxes and solstices must fall in months 2, 5, 8, and 11; if this
would be breached, intercalation is postponed till after the second
month of the following year.
The Chinese calendar was calculated down to 2020/1 by the
Imperial Board of Mathematics; in 1931 it was prohibited by the
Nationalist government of the Republic (which imposed the
Gregorian calendar), but neither this prohibition, nor Communist
campaigns against ‘superstition’, could suppress knowledge even in
China proper, and did not affect Hong Kong (under British rule till

The Chinese year is lunisolar, governed by the Metonic cycle, and by
astronomical calculations reﬁned many times, most notably by the
Jesuit Father Adam Schall in 1644. The day begins at midnight,
halfway through the ﬁrst shí (1/12 day); if at any point within it
(even if just before midnight) the conjunction of sun and moon is
calculated to take place at the longitude of Beijing, it is the ﬁrst of
the month. The ﬁrst month of the civil year (the third of the
astronomical year) is the second lunation after that in which the
winter solstice falls.

Besides the lunar calendar, there is a sequence of 24 ‘solar terms’,
solar half-months beginning when the sun either enters a sign of
the zodiac or reaches its mid-point; various festivals are associated
with these terms, above all the Qı̄ngmíng (‘Pure Bright’) festival
when the sun is halfway through Aries, a time for visiting the
ancestors’ graves. There is also a sexagenary cycle (see Chapter 7)
used for year, month, day, and shí.
Similar calendars, but calculated for the longitudes of the local
capitals, are or have been used in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and
(reckoned from full moon) Tibet.

Mesoamerican calendars

The large cycle is often called tzolkin by modern scholars, from its
Yucatec Maya name, but that is to privilege one language over
another; in Nahuatl, for instance, spoken by the Aztecs, it was called
tonalpuhualli. The components, by contrast, are given Spanish
names, trecena and veintena, from trece ‘13’ and veinte ‘20’. The
days of the trecena were numbered from 1 to 13 (in a few places 2 to
14); those of the veintena had names which differed from language
to language and did not necessarily mean the same thing: the 3rd,
for instance, was Calli (‘house’) in Nahuatl but Akbal (‘night’) in
Yucatec (see Figure 23a). Nevertheless, they were the same day just
as Friday, vendredi, sexta-feira, kenapura, Paraskeví, and pia˛tek
are.
The two sequences ran concurrently: the ﬁrst day of the 260-day
cycle was 1 Cipactli (in Nahuatl)/Imix (in Yucatec; both meant
‘alligator’), the second 2 Ehecatl/Ik (‘wind’), the 13th day 13 Acatl/
Ben (‘cane’), the 14th 1 Ocelotl/Ix (‘jaguar’), the 21st 8 Cipactli/Imix,

The basis of pre-Columbian Central American time-measurement,
which was intimately connected with religion (see Figure 22), was
a standard and unvarying 260-day cycle combining two smaller
cycles of 13 and 20 days respectively.

The History of Time

Besides this cycle, each community had its solar calendar (see
Figure 23b). The structure remained constant: a 365-day annus
vagus was divided into eighteen 20-day units, called ‘months’ in the
local languages, followed by ﬁve unlucky epagomenal days at the
end; but not only was there variation both in month names and in
the tale of days (some calendars counted not 1–20 but 0–19), but
each community counted from whatever day it chose, so that New
Year’s Day in one place might not even be the ﬁrst of a month in
another.
Despite claims to the contrary made in nationalistic revivals of the
pre-Columbian calendar, the leap year, like the wheel, was
introduced by the Conquistadores; from time to time, a calendar
might be replaced by a new one beginning either one day later or
one month earlier, but thereafter the year would contain an
invariable 365 days as before.
Each year was named according to the place in the 260-day cycle
either of New Year’s Day or of the 360th day; since the solar year
was 105 days longer than the cycle, and 105 = 8 × 13 + 1 = 5 × 20 + 5,
the numerical part of the year-name rose by 1 from year to year, but
the day-name advanced ﬁve places in the veintena. Since, moreover,
5 × 4 = 20, in any calendar only four day-names (known as ‘yearbearers’) could be used in designating a year. There were thus
52 possible year-names; when these had been exhausted, a new
‘calendar round’ began to great celebrations.
The Tikal Maya also recognized the tun of 18 months or 360 days,
always ending on a day Ahau; 20 tun made a katun, of which 13
made a may and 20 a unit called baktun by modern scholars; 20
may or 13 baktun constituted a Long Count, altogether 1 872 000
days. This latter, instituted by the Olmec (probably in 355 bc),
began on the completion of the last tun of its predecessor; within it
106

the day was identiﬁed by the number of elapsed baktun, katun, tun,
months, and days, by its place in the day-count, and ﬁnally by the
date in the year. The current Long Count began with the ending of
its predecessor on the day called 0 0 0 0 0 4 Ahau 8 Cumku,
corresponding to 5 September 3114 bc, and will end on 13 0 0 0 0 4
Ahau 3 Kankin = 21 December 2012, the winter solstice.
For astronomical purposes even longer units of time were
acknowledged: the pictun of 20 baktun, the calabtun of 20 pictun,
the kinchiltun of 20 calabtun, and the alautun of 20 kinchiltun or
299 520 000 000 days. The date given above for the end of the
current Long Count may thus be restated as 1 (kinchiltun)
11 (calabtun) 19 (pictun) 13 0 0 0 0 4 Ahau 3 Kankin.

Chapter 7
Marking the year

So used are we to designating years by a number in a standard era
that, while we can understand that another culture may employ a
different era, we are surprised when we ﬁnd it does not use any era
at all. Yet in the ancient world, eras, though far from unknown, were
not the most characteristic means of marking the year, and when
they were used were in many cases of purely local signiﬁcance.
In peasant communities years are frequently identiﬁed by notable
events, such as exceptionally good or bad harvests; this was still the
method used under the earliest Egyptian dynasties (see Figure 24),
and survives in such phrases as ‘the Plague Year’, denoting 1665.
It has the obvious disadvantage that a year in which nothing
much happened is not identiﬁable except in relation to one in
which something did, and only over a short range.
Stating the length of time that elapsed between events is also
difﬁcult, unless a written chronicle is kept of notable occurrences.
Lacking such records, the early Greeks might say that something
had happened three generations ago, meaning it literally: the war
was fought in my great-grandfather’s time, because my grandfather
told me that he had been orphaned by it. (Later historians
converted generations into years, sometimes at 30 years to the
generation, sometimes at 100 years to three generations,
substituting a spurious exactness for long-forgotten experience.)

109

These hit-and-miss methods were not good enough for more
sophisticated societies, which devised means of identifying any year,
however uneventful. These were by eponym, by regnal year, by
cycle, and by era.

The History of Time

Eponyms
The eponym, or eponymous magistrate, was the holder of an annual
ofﬁce after whom the year was designated in some such formula as
‘when X was [title of ofﬁce]’. In Assyria this was the limmu or
mayor of Asshur, at Athens one of the nine magistrates called
archons, at Sparta one of the ﬁve ‘overseers’ or ephors; but the bestknown example is the Roman method of dating by the two consuls
of the year: C. Iulio Caesare M. Calpurnio Bibulo consulibus ‘when
Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus were consuls’
(in 59 bc). It did not matter how much power, or how little, these
magistrates wielded; Spartan ephors interfered at will, Athenian
archons were reduced under democracy to mere administrators, the
mighty consuls of republican Rome lost their power to the emperor,
but still it was they, and not the latter, whose names appeared in
every dated document.
Widespread as this method was in antiquity, it had three
disadvantages: there was no way of identifying a future year other
than as ‘the so-manyeth year from now’; that since Greek cities
began the year at different times, used different month-names,
and did not coordinate intercalations, events that took place
under one eponym in one city could not necessarily be assigned
to a single eponym in another (see box); and without a list of
magistrates one has no idea whether X’s year precedes Y’s and
by how much even in one’s own city, let alone abroad; such lists
were indeed compiled, but were no less subject than other texts to
confusion and corruption. The historian Timaeus of Tauromenium
(now Taormina in Sicily) in the 3rd century bc made it his
business to compare the lists of various cities, and found various
discrepancies.
110

The difﬁculties of eponym dating
The inadequacy of eponym dating was illustrated when the
Greek historian Thucydides needed to date the outbreak of
the Peloponnesian War in spring 431

BC

for a pan-Hellenic

readership:
Fourteen years had the thirty-year truce made after
the capture of Euboea lasted; but in the ﬁfteenth,
when Chrysis had been priestess at Argos for 48
years, Aenesias was ephor at Sparta, and Pythodorus
had two months to serve as archon at Athens, in the
sixth month after the battle of Poteidaea and at the
(Histories, book 2, chapter 2, section 1)

Thereafter Thucydides dates the events of the war by
summers and winters.

Even in respect of Roman consuls, on whom the evidence after the
early Republic is solid (see Figure 25), errors were not avoided in
private lists.
The two consuls of ad 29 were C. Fuﬁus Geminus and L. Rubellius
Geminus; a long-standing early Christian tradition had Jesus
cruciﬁed in the year of two Gemini called ‘Rufus’ and ‘Rubellio’. In
the late 4th century Epiphanius of Salamis, attempting a
chronology of the Saviour’s life, uses a highly inaccurate list of
consuls that makes separate pairs out of ‘the two Gemini’ and ‘Rufus
and Rubellio’ (though he dates the Cruciﬁxion to neither year). No
better, though different, is the list used by Prosper of Aquitaine in

his chronicle (ad 455) and adopted by Victorius (see Chapter 4),
which puts the two Gemini one year early.

Regnal years
In the great monarchies of Egypt and the Near East the
characteristic dating system was that of the king’s reign. This
system required lists of previous monarchs with their lengths of
reigns if one was to make sense of the past (see Figure 26), and was
less than convenient for the future, since one could not know how
long the current reign would last even if the monarch acknowledged
that it might not be for ever.
Nevertheless, the regnal year was adopted by the Emperor Justinian
in ad 537 and became widespread in Europe, even outside the royal
chanceries; it was not only for patriotism’s sake that one learnt the
Kings and Queens of England with their dates, for without them
one would not know whether a document from the third year of
Edward VI superseded or was superseded by one from the 23rd year
112

26. Fragments of Egyptian king-lists
113

of Henry VIII. Down to 1962 it was the ofﬁcial method for dating
(though no longer the most frequent method for citing) United
Kingdom Acts of Parliament.
But when does a regnal year begin? From Justinian onwards, it has
been reckoned from the anniversary of the monarch’s coming to
power (see box), on whatever day it occurred. In the ancient
monarchies, on the other hand, the normal principle was to count
the king’s regnal years from the regular New Year, irrespective of
when his reign had started.

The History of Time

That posed the problem of the period between accession and New
Year. In Sumer and Babylon this was called the beginning of the
reign (or even assigned to the previous king); the modern technical

From coronation to accession
In medieval Europe monarchs often counted their years
from their coronation, since it was coronation that made the
king; even William the Conqueror dated his reign not from
the death of Edward the Confessor, whose rightful successor
he claimed to be, nor from the Battle of Hastings, when
he became master of England, but from his crowning
on Christmas Day 1066. However, when Henry III died on
16 November 1272, his son and heir Edward I was in the
Holy Land, whence it would take him two years to return;
he was proclaimed king on the 20th, from which date his
regnal years were counted. Since then, ‘The king’s peace dies
with the king’ has been supplanted by ‘The king is dead, long
live the king’ – an import from France, where the Capetian
dynasty was able to transmit the crown from father to son for
eight generations between 987 and 1316.

114

term for this reckoning is the accession-year system, since the year
in which the king accedes is treated separately from the numbered
years of his reign, which begin with his ﬁrst New Year.

Egypt apart, Roman emperors did not date by their regnal years
till 537; their full titles declared the number of times that they
had received the annual grant of tribunician power (the
legal basis for their rule), but it was not used as a date; their
responses to legal enquiries, for instance, were dated by the
consuls of the year. That did not prevent their subjects from
counting their regnal years, if they found it convenient, but
according to local principles: when St Luke dated the beginning
of John the Baptist’s mission to the 15th year of Tiberius, this
may have been spring ad 28 to spring 29 for his Jewish Christian
informant, 1 October ad 27 to 30 September 28 for Luke
himself at Antioch, 29 August 28 to 28 August 29 for readers at
Alexandria, and 1 January–31 December 29 for Romans.

Cycles
Faced with the multitude of eponyms with non-coincident terms
of ofﬁce, from the 3rd century bc Greek historians adopted the
115

Marking the year

In Egypt, by contrast, the king’s ﬁrst year began with his accession
and ended (except in the New Kingdom dynasties XVIII–XX,
which used the modern anniversary system) on the last epagomenal
day (see Chapter 2), so that his second and all subsequent years
began on 1 Thoth. This is known as the non-accession-year system;
it survived under the Macedonian rulers and the Roman emperors
down to Diocletian, and was also used (when they used dates at all)
by the Sasanian monarchs of Iran from the 3rd to the 7th centuries
ad. It is familiar in the West as the method for stating a horse’s age;
it is also found in the Old Testament, but not it seems exclusively.
The coexistence of accession- and non-accession-year systems, and
of autumn and spring New Year (Chapter 6), makes biblical

four-year cycle between successive celebrations of the Olympic
Games, which had begun, according to the records, in 776 bc, and
were held in the summer. This system, though conﬁned (except at
Olympia) to historical reference, could be understood by any Greek
in any city, though writers still equated years in one calendar with
those of another even when they began at different times, or
extended their narrative over an entire campaigning season without
regarding the change of year.
The Olympiad is thus an example of cyclical chronology, in which a
ﬁxed number of years are grouped into a cycle and the individual
year numbered according to its position within the cycle. It is
unusual in that the cycle itself is numbered. More typical is the
indiction, a 15-year tax-cycle instituted (it is generally thought) in
ad 312; the cycle itself is almost never numbered, but the year is
regularly called the ‘nth indiction’, meaning the so-manyeth year of
the cycle. In the late Roman Empire the indiction was very soon
used in non-ﬁscal contexts, being more important to most people
than the ofﬁcial dating system by consuls; in Byzantine documents
it is far more reliable than the Year of the World, which as we shall
see in the next section may be counted in any of several different
ways.
The indiction is also found in the medieval West, partly as a residue
of the late Empire, partly through dissemination in Dionysius’
Easter tables (Chapter 4), but is not to be accorded the same
authority; whereas in the East the indiction, reckoned at
Constantinople from 1 September, enables us to determine which
form of the world era is being used, in the West it is the year ad, the
regnal year, or preferably both that indicate from which of several
possible dates the indiction year is counted.
The most important cycle of years is the 12-year animal cycle used
in central and eastern Asia, made familiar in the West by Chinese
astrology. The years of the cycle are not numbered but named
according to their presiding animal, the Rat, the Ox, the Tiger, the
116

Hare, the Dragon, the Snake, the Horse, the Sheep, the Monkey, the
Fowl, the Dog, and the Pig. (There are local variations: the Buffalo
may replace the Ox and in Vietnam the Cat stands in for the Hare.)
In China these animals are associated with the Twelve Branches
that, together with the Ten Stems, form a 60-year cycle. But this
sexagenary cycle (from Latin sexageni, ‘sixty each’), was applied not
only to years, but months, days, and shí (double hours); in older
records cyclical notation of days is more frequent than dating by
quantième and month.

In Japan the era (nengō) was not coextensive with the reign till
1868. The non-accession-year system is used, and since 1873 the
Gregorian calendar: 1 Shōwa lasted from 26 December 1926, when
the Shōwa emperor (Hirohito) acceded, to the 31st, 1 Heisei (the
current era) from 8 January to 31 December 1989.
After the overthrow of the last Chinese emperor, a Republic
(Mingguo) era was instituted that is still used on Taiwan; years are
counted on an accession-year basis from 1912. That is also the
epoch, being the birth-year of Kim Il Sung, for the non-accessionyear Juche (‘Self-Reliance’) era instituted in 1997 by North Korea,
named after the regime’s professed principle. These may be
regarded (political sentiment apart) as true eras, not limited by an
individual’s whim or lifespan.

117

Marking the year

The 60-year cycle coexists with the niánhào, or ‘year-name’,
generally translated ‘era’. Before 1368 every emperor would
proclaim a new era, with some auspicious name or other, at the
start of his reign and again during it whenever he saw ﬁt; thereafter
each reign was its own era, and its niánhào was applied after
death to the emperor himself. Thus the emperor in whose time the
most famous Chinese porcelain was produced was not the Emperor
Qianlong (or Ch’ien-lung in the older transcription), but the
Qianlong Emperor, after his ‘Celestial Prosperity’ era.

The History of Time

Eras
The term ‘era’, for a chronology in which years are numbered
continuously from a starting point or epoch without reverting to 1,
is derived from the post-classical Latin word aera or era, properly
denoting the place of an item in a numbered sequence and hence
used for the serial number of the year (now called by the French
term millésime). The chronological use originated in Spain, where
years expressed in the local dating-system (for which see below)
were indicated not by anno but by (a)era (e.g. era mclxxiii, as it
were ‘no. 1173’ = ad 1135); the word was extended to mean the
dating sequence itself, and then others like it. The great merits of
era datings are that the intervals between events are easily
calculated without the need to add up the lengths of reigns or count
off magistrates from a list, and that future years may be identiﬁed as
far ahead as one wishes.
The epoch of an era may be a correctly dated historical event, such
as the Prophet Muhammad’s hijra or departure from Mecca to
Medina, from which the Muslim era is reckoned (see Chapter 6);
but for chronological purposes it makes no difference if the date is
wrong or doubtful, as in the case of the Christian era, nor if the
event itself is legendary, like the accession of the Emperor Jinmu in
660 bc, from which in the ultra-nationalist period Japanese years
were counted.
Eras may be reckoned either in current years, in which year 1 begins
immediately after the epoch, or in elapsed years, in which it begins
only when a year has already been completed. Both systems are
familiar to us for stating ages: when we say that a person is in his or
her 25th year we are counting current years, but when we say that
the same person is 24 years old we are counting elapsed years. In
era dating current years are the norm except in India; of the many
Indian eras the most important is the Saka era, reckoned in elapsed
years from ad 78, on which the National Calendar is based (see
Chapter 6).
118

In Hellenistic and Roman times there were numerous local eras,
commemorating political events, but few were of any signiﬁcance
outside the city or province concerned. These eras do not include
the ab urbe condita reckoning from 753 bc familiar in modern
writings about Rome, since Romans were not agreed on the correct
date of foundation; when an event is said to have taken place so
many years after the foundation, this is no more a formal dating
than ‘a hundred years after the Norman Conquest’ would be in
English.

Other eras, such as that of Provincia Arabia (epoch 22 March
ad 106), were more localized and mostly short-lived; an exception
in the latter respect is the Hispanic era, with epoch 1 January 38 bc.
This is traditionally associated with Augustus, for no clear historical
reason, but may commemorate the beginning of Roman conquest in
the Pyrenaean region where the earliest (but contested) examples of
this reckoning have been found. The era is indubitably attested
from the late 4th century; it was used in Visigothic Spain (except for
119

Marking the year

The most important era in classical antiquity was the Seleucid era
of western Asia. In 311 bc the Macedonian satrap or governor of
Babylon, Seleucus, having restored himself to power by force of
arms, began numbering his years of renewed ofﬁce from 1 Nisanu,
in that year corresponding to 3 April; when a few years later he took
the title of king, he did not alter the count. His Macedonian and
other Greek subjects adopted it, but, being used to Macedonian
years that began in the autumn, they placed the epoch six months
earlier, in late 312 instead of early 311. After his death – by which
time his realm extended from Turkey to Tajikistan – the count was
maintained by his successors; it remained in use throughout
antiquity, was kept up by Jews (who called it ‘the reckoning of
contracts’) till the Renaissance (even longer in Yemen), and
survived amongst Nestorian Christians till the second half of the
20th century, when, styling themselves the Assyrian Church of
the East, they adopted an era with epoch 1 April 4750 bc, based
on a surmised foundation date of Asshur.

the easternmost portions, where it appears only after the
Reconquista), and lasted in ofﬁcial use till the later Middle
Ages: in Aragon till 1350, in Castile till 1383, and in Portugal
till 1422.

The History of Time

World eras
The era that would ultimately displace the Seleucid era amongst
Jews was a world era, that is one reckoned from the creation of the
world; for this purpose they adopted the epoch already used for
calendrical calculation, 3761 bc (see Chapter 6). The Jewish year
from 16 September 2004 to 3 October 2005 is thus am 5763, often
(especially in Hebrew) written ’763; am, standing for annus mundi,
or ‘year of the world’, is the conventional qualiﬁcation for a year in
any world era, including those devised by Christians. The basis of
such eras was the chronology of the Old Testament, which is far
from simple and is also considerably shorter in the Hebrew text and
St Jerome’s Latin version than in the Greek translation known as
the Septuagint. World eras were mainly developed by Greekspeakers, beginning with Sextus Julius Africanus (c. 221), who
placed the conception of Christ on 25 March and made it the ﬁrst
day of am 5501. This is commonly taken to be 2–1 bc (though not
all his datings ﬁt). Nearly a century later, Eusebius of Caesarea
dated Creation to 5200 bc, Christ being born in am 5199; however,
he preferred to call this ‘year of Abraham 2015’.
Disseminated through Jerome’s translation of his Chronicle,
Eusebius’ calculation became the standard theory in the West till
Bede, using the Latin Bible, reduced the period between Creation
and Nativity to 3952 years. Other Greek-speakers, however,
preferred the higher interval of Africanus, or one close to it, but
adjusted so that the Creation should take place on a Sunday; the
most favoured was the era of Annianus (early 5th century), in which
the Creation took place on Sunday, 29 Phamenoth = 25 March
5492 bc, and the Incarnation, meaning the Conception of Jesus
Christ, on Monday, 29 Phamenoth am 5501 = 25 March ad 9.
120

However, although reckoning the year from the anniversary of
Creation was theologically attractive, in practical life it was
inconvenient; the epoch was therefore adjusted to the civil New
Year before Creation, 1 Thoth/29 August 5493 bc. This caused
Incarnation and Nativity to fall in different years: rather than
redesignate the year of Nativity 5502, the Alexandrians reassigned
the Incarnation to am 5500, which had the advantage of placing it
on a Sunday, 25 March ad 8; the am 5501 in which the Nativity
supposedly took place now began on 29 August ad 8. This became
the ﬁrst year in an era still used in Ethiopia, where the Year of Grace
2000 will begin on 30 August Old Style = 12 September 2007.

Perpetuated reigns
Some eras developed out of regnal years continued after the death
of the monarch: as we saw in Chapter 6, the Zoroastrian era
commemorates Shah Yäzdegird III, whose ﬁrst regnal year began
on 16 June ad 632. Several such eras were created by astronomers,
who found continuous numeration helpful; one is the era of
Nabonassar, reckoned in Egyptian anni vagi from 1 Thoth =
26 February 747 bc, the ﬁrst year (on the Egyptian reckoning) of
the Babylonian king from whose time onwards astronomical
records were preserved. Another is the era of Diocletian.
When Augustus (as he later became) conquered Egypt in 30 bc, he
ruled it as king through a viceroy or prefect, outside the general
121

Marking the year

The 7th-century Chronicon Paschale (so called because it began
with an account of Easter reckoning) opted for 25 March 5509 bc.
Later Byzantines, however, preferred to defer the Creation till the
beginning of the civil year on 1 September; an unsuccessful
alternative was 25 March 5508. In Russia the year of Creation was
the regular dating system, reckoned originally from 1 March 5508
(less often 5509) bc but by the later 14th century from 1 September
5509 bc, till by decree of Peter the Great 31 December am 7208 was
followed by 1 January 1700 Old Style.

The History of Time

provincial system, counting his years on the established nonaccession system. His successors followed suit until Diocletian, at
the end of the 3rd century ad, integrated Egypt into his reformed
provincial structure and introduced consular dating. That was
highly inconvenient for astronomers, who would need to keep lists
of consuls in order to understand their own observation-records;
instead, they continued to count by Diocletian’s regnal years, of
which the ﬁrst was 284/5, even after his abdication in 305. This was
the method used to designate years in Alexandrian Easter tables; it
spread to general dating purposes, and is still the favoured era of the
Coptic church. However, since Diocletian, in his last years of power,
had unleashed the Great Persecution against the Church, from the
7th century the era was renamed that of the Martyrs. After year 532
of the Martyrs (= ad 815/16) years are sometimes numbered over
again in Paschal cycles of 532 years, so that (for instance) year 257
may be not 540/1 but 1072/3 or 1604/5.

Christian era
The odiousness of the persecutor’s name was also the reason given
by Dionysius Exiguus for replacing, in his Easter table, the era of
Diocletian with that of the Incarnation, ‘so that the beginning of our
hope might be better known to us and the cause of human
restoration, that is the passion of our Redeemer, might shine forth
more clearly’. The Incarnation is not the Passion; but Dionysius was
brushing aside his predecessor Victorius, who had designated the
years in his table by an era of the Passion reckoned from ad 28, his
compatriot Prosper’s inaccurate date for the two Gemini. (This was
not the only Passion era known: at Rome in Bede’s day years were
counted from ad 34, or perhaps 33; other dates are found in
the East.)
Dionysius treats his Incarnation date as unproblematic and
uncontroversial, neither explaining how it is known nor claiming it
as his own discovery. Since most earlier writers had dated the
Incarnation to 2 bc, this has been difﬁcult to explain: one theory
122

requires him to misread or misrepresent the Olympiad date of
Diocletian’s accession in Eusebius’ Chronicle, compiled in the late
3rd century, or its translation by Jerome; however, since the
Nativity in ad 1 is already found in a calendar written in 354,
another scholar shifts the blame to Eusebius, supposing a
miscalculation in the Easter table that we know him to have written.

Nevertheless, Dionysius’ date shares with the 2 bc it displaced the
defect of being incompatible with both Gospel narratives, for St
Matthew’s story of the Magi and the Holy Innocents requires the
Nativity to have taken place at least two years before the death of
Herod the Great at Passover 4 bc, and St Luke’s narrative places it
in ad 6, when ‘Cyrenius’, that is to say P. Sulpicius Quirinius, was
incorporating Judaea into the Roman province of Syria. No solution
of the problem has yet satisﬁed either believers or non-believers in
the literal truth of the Bible.

The year of the Incarnation
When preachers say on Christmas Day that Christ was born so
many years ago, they always give the number of the current year,
implying that the Nativity took place on 25 December 1 bc; that was
also the view of those churches and orders that counted the era
123

Marking the year

Another suggestion is that Dionysius deliberately fudged his ﬁgures
in order that leap years should continue to be divisible by 4, as in
the Alexandrian tables; for although the leap day had been added in
the previous year, it was in the exact multiples, such as year 244 of
Diocletian, that it affected the Easter calculations. It was and is
convenient that year 248 of Diocletian should be 532 of the
Incarnation, rather than 531 or 533. The Church historian Socrates,
translating into Greek the report that the emperor Valens began his
reign on V Kal. Mart., rendered it in the normal way as 25 February
without realizing that the year in question was a leap year, so that
the correct date was the 26th. Had he, like us, known the year as
364, he could have seen the fact at once.

from that date (see below). By contrast, although this is the ﬁrst
year in Dionysius’ 19-year cycle, Bede, following Irish sources, took
him to have put the Incarnation in a year whose characteristics
match the second year of his cycle, ad 1; this is more compatible
with the preference for current over elapsed years, though the
computist of 243 had devised an elapsed-year era of the Exodus.
Dionysius himself is unlikely to have given the matter any thought.

The History of Time

The spread of AD dating
Dionysius’ Incarnation era, like Victorius’ Passion era, was
originally devised for the sake of Easter tables; a few authors use it
for relative chronology, typically in conjunction with the
incompatible chronology of Eusebius. However, the habit of writing
annals, or brief records of a year’s events, in the blank spaces of
Easter tables encouraged a closer association between era-date and
year; this was particularly congenial to Irish and English monks, for
whom the Emperor was a foreign potentate and whose countries
were divided among numerous kings and kinglets.
Although the prevalent means of identifying the year in Ireland, at
least in monastic writings, was by the feria and lune of 1 January, we
ﬁnd explicit dating by Victorius’ Passion era as early as 658. In
Northumbria by the late 7th century Dionysius’ Easter reckoning
prevailed over Victorius’; it was therefore Dionysius’ era that
Willibrord, the apostle of the Frisians, employed when he noted in
his calendar that he had crossed the sea to Francia ‘in the 690th
year from Christ’s Incarnation’, had been ordained bishop in 695,
and was now living in 728.
The decisive moment, however, was Bede’s decision to use this
reckoning in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, rather
than the world era of his chronicle; the History, an instant classic,
brought Incarnation dating to the attention of Continental readers,
who in due course began to adopt it for themselves. Although
alternative epochs of 22 bc (Abbo of Fleury in the 10th century) and
124

23 bc (Marianus Scottus of Fulda in the 11th) were proposed in
order to salvage the Western tradition that the Cruciﬁxion took
place on 25 March, which was luna XIV in ad 12, and Gerlandus of
Lotharingia in the 11th century adapted the Alexandrian
Incarnation era to the Julian calendar by subtracting seven years
from the date ad, the Dionysian era prevailed, ousting even the
deep-rooted Hispanic era, to become the world-wide standard even
outside Christendom.

Dating ‘before Christ’

Astronomical dating
Whereas in normal usage ad 1 is preceded by 1 bc, in astronomical
reckoning the year 1 (unlabelled) is preceded by year 0, and that in
turn by −1, corresponding to 2 bc; correspondingly 45 bc is −44,
100 bc is −99, and so on. This not only assists calculation (from −7
to 3 is 3 − (−7) years = 3 + 7 years = 10 years), but makes all years
divisible by 4 leap years; in the normal reckoning this applies only
to years ad, those bc being leap if of the form 4n + 1.

Ideological content of eras
Although a regnal year may send a message at a time of political
contention, it is eras that are the most obviously ideological form of
125

Marking the year

The Christian era is the only era in which dates before the epoch are
regularly identiﬁed as such; if occasional instances in the Middle
Ages are still comparable with casual references to events so many
years before the foundation of Rome or the Hispanic era, since the
18th century it has been normal to count ‘years before Christ’ on the
same footing as ‘years of our Lord’. The main resistance came from
German historians of ancient Rome, who preferred to canonize the
‘Varronian’ date for the city’s foundation, and switch to the
Christian era only from the epoch onwards, so that 753 was
followed by 1; this usage is now obsolete.

The History of Time

chronology. To the many examples already seen may be added the
turmoil caused in Iran when on 24 Esfänd 1354 solar Hejri (the
Farsi pronunciation of hijrı̄), corresponding to 14 March 1976,
Mohammad Reza Shah decreed a new Shahänshahi (‘Imperial’) era,
reckoned from Cyrus the Great’s accession to the Persian throne in
559 bc, to begin a week later (1354 being a leap year) at Nawruz
2535.
This, one of many attempts at associating the dynasty with the
glorious Achaemenids of ancient times, was received by the people
as an affront to Islam. A Western reader may conceive some faint
idea of the indignation aroused by imagining that Mussolini,
instead of instituting a Fascist Era with epoch 29 October 1922 to
be used concurrently with the Christian, had replaced the Christian
era with that of Rome, so that 1923 had become 2676. Popular
protest forced restoration of the Hejri era from 5 Shährivar 1357
(27 August 1978).
The Christian era is too well established to be challenged for its
religious origin; in China indeed, where Christianity has never been
more than a minority religion, it was made ofﬁcial by the antireligious Communists. However, the name has come under attack;
whereas Muslims freely speak of the mı̄lādı̄ or ‘Nativity’ year,
Continental secularists prefer to call the era simply ‘ours’ (notre ère,
unsere Zeit), and amongst English-speakers the term ‘Common
Era’, already standard in Jewish usage (compare Hebrew ha-seﬁrah,
‘the count’), has become widespread in American academic
writing. Even some Christians have accepted it, whether in an
anti-proselytizing spirit or because there are no grounds for
believing the era’s epoch to be the true date of the event that it
commemorates. Nevertheless, if it does not commemorate the
birth of Christ, it has no business to exist at all, for no other
event of world-historical signiﬁcance took place in either
1 bc or ad 1.

126

Beginning of the year
If Incarnation and Nativity are to fall in the same year, it must
begin no later than 25 March; but this date is impossible for a
computistic year, since Easter may precede it. Yet Dionysius’ lunar
regulars presuppose a year beginning in September as at
Byzantium (it was Bede who recalculated them from January); if
forced to specify, he might have stated that his epochal year ran
from 1 September to 31 August, incorporating the Incarnation,
from which he counts, but not the Nativity, from which he does
not.

Pisa and Florence retained their respective usages down to 1749,
before being ordered to count from 1 January by Grand Duke
Leopold of Tuscany; the English style was reformed by Act of
127

Marking the year

His Western readers, however, took some time to recognize the
difference between Incarnation and Nativity. It was quite
frequent for years to be reckoned, not from 1 January ad 1 – a
date disliked by the Church on account of the pagan festivities it
had failed to suppress – but from seven days previously,
25 December 1 bc, the supposed date of the Nativity. This,
despite Bede, was the practice in Anglo-Saxon England, and long
remained in use in Benedictine monasteries; but it was ultimately
supplanted by the rival principle of counting from the
Incarnation proper on 25 March, the Annunciation or Lady Day.
In the late 10th century, we ﬁnd in parts of southern France and
northern Italy an epoch of 25 March 1 bc, resulting in a
millésime 1 higher than in the modern reckoning till
31 December; this fell out of favour except in Pisa, for
which reason it is known as the calculus Pisanus. More
widespread was Annunciation in ad 1, with a millésime 1
lower than the modern between 1 January and 24 March; this
was characteristic of Florence and England, for which
reason it is known as the stilus Florentinus, or the ‘custom of the
English church’ (consuetudo ecclesiae Anglicanae).

The History of Time

Parliament in 1751 (Scotland had used 1 January since 1600).
Venice preferred to count from the beginning of the Incarnation
month, that is 1 March ad 1, and continued to do so in ofﬁcial
documents till the suppression of the Republic in 1797. If this mos
Venetus was more convenient than changing the millésime within a
month, the French custom, mos Gallicus, of beginning the year at
Easter was less so: but even after the royal ordinance abolishing it
in 1564 local resistance prolonged its use in some parts of the
country (in the Beauvaisis till 1580).
Exact study of documents has shown that the medieval dates for
the change of millésime varied within as well as between countries
to an even greater extent than is stated in reference books.
Nevertheless, throughout Europe west of the Byzantine Empire,
‘New Year’ and its equivalents in other languages regularly meant
1 January even before the adoption of the Modern Style, as counting
from that day is known.

Hybrid systems
Some Christian chronologies state the years of their eras according
to the 532-year Paschal cycle: in Georgia from the 9th to the
19th century, dates were given in years of the kronik’oni, a Paschal
cycle reckoned from ad 781 or 1313, respectively the 13th or 14th
from Creation in 5604 bc. Coptic years of the Martyrs may also
be reduced to years of a Paschal cycle (see p. 122).

Designation by characteristics
As we have seen, Irish monks commonly designated years by
the lune and feria of 1 January; the lune might be taken from the
Latercus, Victorius, or Dionysius, depending on the custom of
the house. Designation by characteristics, in this case the place of
the year in the trecena and veintena of the 260-day cycle, was also
the norm for Mesoamerican solar years.

128

Julian Period, Julian Day
The work of making chronological sense out of ancient data was
begun by the great polymath Joseph Justus Scaliger in his De
emendatione temporum (1583), with the help of a new dating
method, the Julian Period. This was a cycle of 7980 years,
combining the 19-year Golden Number cycle, the 28-year solar
cycle, and the 15-year cycle of indictions; since the next 15th
indiction ending an Easter cycle in the unreformed calendar was
3267, Scaliger made that year jp 7980, so that jp 1 was 4713 bc. For
any year bc, the year jp is obtained by subtraction from 4714, for
any year ad by adding 4713; its place in the cycles is the remainder
to 19, 28, and 15 respectively. Thus 1583 was jp 6296, Golden
Number 7, solar cycle 24, indiction 11.

The Julian Period is not to be confused with the Julian Year,
counted from the introduction of the Julian calendar in 45 bc = jp
4669, mentioned by Censorinus in ad 238 and used by some early
modern writers for discussions of New Testament chronology. It
would make an excellent secular – and politically uncontentious –
substitute for the Christian era, being related to the calendar rather
129

Marking the year

Unfortunately, Pope Gregory’s reform (which Scaliger, as a
Protestant, of course opposed) had just abolished the Paschal cycle,
and the indiction was of no practical use; nevertheless, astronomers
have found the epoch of service as the basis for a continuous count
of Julian Days, which is counted in elapsed days from noon on
Monday, 1 January jp 1, also written –4712 I 1; the 24 hours from
then till noon on 2 January jp 1 are thus jd 0. When the Julian Day
is followed by a decimal representing the fraction of the day elapsed
since the preceding noon, it becomes the Julian Date. In order to
respect the midnight start to the day adopted in 1925, and to avoid
high numbers, the Modiﬁed Julian Date or MJD is often used; this
is the Julian Date minus 2 400 000.5. For example, 6 a.m. on
31 March 2004 is MJD 53 095.25, corresponding to Julian
Date 2 453 095.75.

The History of Time

than any external event, but for the inconvenience that leap years
are of the form 4n + 1 instead of exact multiples of 4, and the even
greater inconvenience that a change to the common era of the
human race would cause confusion and expense even in those
countries that ofﬁcially use a different reckoning.

Appendix B

The History of Time

The Alexandrian Easter
As stated in Chapter 4, the Easter reckoning that became standard
at both Rome and Constantinople was an adaptation to the Roman
calendar of Alexandrian calculations in which a lunar Paschal
calendar was mapped onto the civil year as reformed by Augustus
(see the Alexandrian calendar below).
The lunar calendar was a notional Jewish calendar not actually used
by Jews whether at Alexandria or elsewhere, in which no notice was
taken of the rules restricting the feria of 1 Tishri. It comprised
12 months, alternately full and hollow, each conceived as beginning
in the corresponding solar month, as in the Egyptian religious
calendar, rather than ending in it as in the West. In order that the
year should begin no earlier than 15 Thoth, an embolismic month of
30 days was added at the end of years 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 in the
cycle. The civil leap day, corresponding to 29 August in a Julian leap
year, and occurring either four or ﬁve times within the cycle, was
not given its own lune; since 19 × 365 = 6935 days and 19 × 354 + 7 ×
30 = 6936, in the last year of the cycle there was a saltus at the end
of the 11th lunar month, so that lunar age 30 was reached on
5 Epagomenon (28 August). The last lunar month then ran
from 1 to 29 Thoth, the ﬁrst solar month of the new cycle, and the
ﬁrst lunar month on 30 Thoth. Since the lune of 5 Epagomenon
132

was taken as the epact of the following year, the cycle began each
time with an epact variously designated 30, 29 (since the saltus
made the 11th lunar month hollow), or 0.
In order to ﬁnd the feria of any given day, Alexandrian astrologers
had devised a two-part algorithm. The ﬁrst part consisted in
dividing the year of Diocletian by 4, ignoring the remainder, adding
the quotient to the whole and also the parameter 2, and then taking
the remainder of the total to 7; if there is no remainder, call the
answer 7. This process yielded the ‘days of the gods’ for the year (the
gods being those who ruled the planets); from these the feria of the
given date was found by adding to them 2 for every month up to and
including it, plus the quantième, and taking the remainder to 7.

Since the feria on which a given date falls will be one later every year
except when further advanced by an intervening leap day, and since
there are 7 feriae in the week and 4 years in the leap-year cycle, the
full pattern of correspondences recurs after 7 × 4 = 28 years (the
solar cycle). Since there are 19 possible dates for the luna XIV, the
full pattern of Easter dates recurs after 28 × 19 = 532 years; this is
known as the Paschal cycle. However, although the Alexandrians
knew this, they generally drew up their tables to cover only
5 Metonic cycles, making 95 years, partly because there were still
expectations that the world would end in its 6000th year, which
was expected about ad 500, and partly because in the Alexandrian
calendar the same date continues to fall on the same feria at 95-year
133

Appendices

However, Christians noticed that the ‘days of the gods’
corresponded to the feria of 1 Thoth, and therefore of 1 Pharmouthi
(27 March), in a week counted from Wednesday instead of Sunday.
They therefore adopted it, without change of name, as the basis for
ﬁnding the Sunday after luna XIV; if, for instance, luna XIV fell
on 3 Pharmouthi (29 March) and there were 7 days of the gods,
they knew that 1 Pharmouthi was a Tuesday, that 3 Pharmouthi
was a Thursday, and therefore that Easter Day would be on the
6th (1 April).

intervals until it reaches a leap year, when it is one feria earlier. (In
the Julian calendar, the same is true before the leap day, but from
leap day onwards, and hence at Eastertide, the feriae of the later
year will be the same; on the other hand, if the earlier year is a leap
year, the feriae in the later year will match it before leap day and
then diverge.)
