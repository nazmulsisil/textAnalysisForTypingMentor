Super human qualities are qualities that exceed those found in humans. Super human abilities are found in some fictional characters, especially as superheroes in American comic books and Marvel movies. Fictional characters have been portrayed as having psychic abilities, flying abilities, impossible strength, or exceptional proficiency beyond human capability. Super human can also mean something that is not human, but considered to be "superior" to humans in some way, e.g. a tiger may be described as having "superhuman strength". Superhuman abilities may result from human enhancement by genetic modification, cybernetic implants, nanotechnology, radiation or from human evolution in the future. If you search Google and Youtube you will find many pictures and videos with real live people who have some superhuman ability. It's human nature to try and discover these super human qualities and Hollywood has the profound effect on expanding the horizons as well as the consciousness of millions of people and produce Superhuman movies like the XMen , SpiderMan , Magneto, Captain America , The Matrix , The Terminator, Minority Report, Avatar, Transcendence , The Machine , Phenomenon , Lucy, The Avengers , Betman , Ready Player One , Wolverine, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Deadpool, Black Panther, Daredevil, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Fantastic Four..
